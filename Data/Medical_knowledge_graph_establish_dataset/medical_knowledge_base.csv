alveolar proteinosis,"alveolar proteinosis (pap), also known as rosen-castle-man-liebow syndrome, is a rare disease.the disease is filled with pas staining positive in the alveolar and bronchial lumens, and the phospholipid-rich protein substance from the lung is characterized by the fact that it occurs in young and middle-aged people, and the incidence of males is about three times that of females.","1, to avoid infection with mycobacterial disease, karst lung cyst pneumonia, cytomegalovirus and so on. 2, pay attention to exercise, improve immunity.","the cause is unknown, and it is speculated that it is related to several factors: such as a large amount of dust inhalation (aluminum, silica, etc.), decreased immune function (especially infants and young children), genetic factors, alcoholism, microbial infections, etc., and sometimes it is difficult to confirm infection. is the primary pathogenic factor or secondary to alveolar proteinosis, such as cytomegalovirus, pneumocystis carinii, histoplasmosis infection, etc., found high alveolar protein deposition. although the triggering factor is still unclear, it basically agrees that the pathogenesis is caused by lipid metabolism disorder, that is, the metabolism of alveolar surfactant is abnormal due to the action of external factors in the body. so far, more alveolar macrophages have been studied. cell viability, animal experiments show that the activity of macrophages after phagocytosis of dust is significantly reduced, and the macrophage particles in the patient's lavage fluid can reduce the normal cell viability, and the alveolar macrophage viability after bronchoalveolar lavage treatment. it can be raised, and the study found no increase in type ii cell-producing protein and no abnormality in systemic lipid metabolism. therefore, it is generally believed that this disease is associated with decreased clearance ability.","['cyanosis', 'chest pain', 'breathing difficulties', 'living']",['multiple lung infections'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']",['bronchoalveolar lavage']
pertussis,"pertussis (whoopingcough) is an acute respiratory infection caused by bordetella pertussis.it is characterized by paroxysmal spasmodic cough, with a special snoring inhalation snoring at the end of the cough.the course of the disease is long, up to several weeks or even 3 months, so it is called pertussis.more common in children under the age of 5, young children suffering from this disease are prone to suffocation, pneumonia, encephalopathy and other complications, high mortality.patients with whooping cough, negative infections and carriers are the source of infection.at the end of the incubation period, 2-3 weeks after the disease, the infection is the strongest.pertussis is transmitted through the respiratory droplets.the typical patient's course of disease is 6-8 weeks, and the clinical course can be divided into 3 phases: 1. the catarrhal phase, coughing occurs from the onset to the beginning, usually 1-2 weeks.2, coughing period, usually 2-4 weeks or longer, paroxysmal spastic cough is the characteristic of this period.3, recovery period, generally 1-2 weeks, the number of cough attacks decreased, the degree is reduced, no more paroxysmal cough.generally, the peripheral blood white blood cell count is significantly increased, and the classification is mainly lymphocytes.in the diagnosis of this disease, attention should be paid to the identification of bronchial foreign body and hilar lymph node tuberculosis.in recent years, the incidence of infants and adults has increased.","1, control of the source of infection: in the epidemic season, if there are prodromal symptoms should be early antibiotic treatment. 2, cut off the transmission route: because the pertussis bacillus is weak to the outside world, there is no need for disinfection treatment, but the indoor ventilation should be maintained, the clothes should be exposed to sunlight, and the sputum and mouth and nose secretions should be disinfected.","(1) causes of the disease the pathogen is b. pertussis in bordetella, commonly known as b. pertussis. it is known that b. genus has four bacilli, and there are also b. pertussis except for b. pertussis. (b. parapertussis), b. bronchiseptica and b. avium, b. avium, which does not cause human disease, causes only bird infection, and b. pertussis about 1.0 ~ 1.5米m, width about 0.3 ~ 0.5米m, with capsule, can not move, gram stain negative, aerobic, no spores, no flagella, stained with toluidine blue stained at both ends, bacterial culture requires a lot of 15% to 25%) blood can only breed well, so the colonies are often isolated in border-gengous medium (ie blood, glycerin, potato), and the growth of b. pertussis is slow, in a humid environment of 35-37 ～ c 3 ~ after 7 days, a small, opaque colony grows, the first colony is swelled and smooth, and it is smooth (s) type, also known as phase i bacteria. the morphology is high and low, with capsule and strong virulence and antigenicity. strong disease, such as the isolation of the colony in the ordinary medium to continue cultivation, bacteriafalling from smooth to rough (r) type, called iv phase bacteria, no capsule, loss of virulence and antigenicity, and loss of pathogenicity, phase ii, phase iii is intermediate transition type, b. pertussis can produce many toxicity factor, there are five toxins known: 1. pertussis exotoxin (pt): is a protein in the cell wall of b. pertussis. it used to be called leukocytosis or lymphocyte promoting factor (lpe), histamine sensitizing factor (hsf). ), insulin activating protein (iap), pertussis exotoxin consists of five non-covalent chain subunits (s1 ~ s5), subunit (s2 ~ s5) is a non-toxic unit, can be with the host cell membrane binding, mediated by the subunit s1 with enzyme activity, s1 can catalyze the partial adp-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) by the activity of adenosine diphosphate (adp)-ribosyltransferase separation, transfer to the cell membrane inhibits guanosine triphosphate (ctp) binding, ie g protein synthesis, leading to cell metaplasia, while also promoting lymphocyte elevation, activation of islet cells and enhancement of immune response. 2, heat-resistant endotoxin (endotoxin, et), 100 ～ c 60min can only be partially destroyed, 180 ～ c can be inactivated, this toxin can cause fever and cough. 3, heat-resistant toxin (hlt) this toxin can destroy its toxic effects after heating at 55 ～ c for 30 min. this toxin antibody has no protective effect on b. pertussis infection. 4, tracheal cytotoxin (tct): can damage the host airway ciliated epithelial cells, denaturation, necrosis. 5. adenosine cyclase toxin (act): an enzyme on the surface of b. pertussis cells. this enzyme is activated by calmodulin after entering phagocytic cells, catalyzes the production of camp, interferes with phagocytosis, and inhibits neutrophils. chemotactic and phagocytic bactericidal ability to enable continuous infection, act is also a hemolysin, capable of hemolysis, the important antigen of pertussis is two hemagglutination active antigens of pertussis, one is filag hemagglutinin (filamentous hemagglutinin, fha), also known as pilus antigen from the surface of the bacteria, fha plays a decisive role in the adhesion of b. pertussis to the airway epithelial cells, which is the main cause of the disease.the experiment found that fha-immunized mice can fight the lethal challenge of b. pertussis, so fha is a protective antigen, and another agglutinogen (agg) is a protein component of the outer membrane and pili of b. pertussis, mainly containing 1 , 2, 3 three serotype coagulation factors, agg-1 is species-specific; agg-2, 3 is type-specific, by detecting the type of agglutinogen to understand the local epidemic, currently considered two hemagglutinin the antigen-related antibody is a protective antibody, and b. pertussis is classified into a seven-type agglutinant according to the heat-resistant agglutination antigenicity, a type 1 agglutination is possessed by all b. pertussis, and a type 7 agglutinogen is a b. genus (including a pertussis). bacillus bronchus, b. bronchus), type 2-6 is divided into different serotypes by different combinations, and the serotype is mainly determined by studying the serotype of the strain at the time of epidemic and selecting a special serotype strain to produce the vaccine. there is no cross-immunization between b. pertussis and b. pertussis, and it can also cause epidemics. b. pertussis has weak resistance to external physical and chemical factors, and is destroyed at 55 ～ c for 30 min.to kill, the general disinfectant sensitive, weak resistance to ultraviolet light, but survived longer in 0 ~ 10 ⊥. (two) pathogenesis 1. pathogenesis: the pathogenesis of whooping cough is not clear. it is probably the result of the comprehensive action of pertussis toxin on the body. when the bacteria are immersed in the respiratory tract of susceptible people with air droplets, the filamentous hemagglutinin of the bacteria adheres to the throat to fine. the surface of the ciliary epithelial cells of the bronchial mucosa; followed by the local reproduction of bacteria and the production of various toxins such as pertussis toxin, adenylate cyclase and other epithelial cell cilia palsy and cell degeneration, resulting in decreased protein synthesis, epithelial cell necrosis and systemic reactions, due to epithelial cell lesions and cilia paralysis, the mucus and necrotic epithelium in the small bronchi are piled up, the discharge of secretions is blocked, the peripheral nerves of the respiratory tract are constantly stimulated, the cerebral cortex and the medullary cough center are transmitted, and the reflex is caused. spastic cough, due to long-term stimulation, the cough center forms an excitatory foci, so that non-specific stimuli, such as eating, pharyngeal examination, cold wind, smoke and injection pain, can cause reflex cough, and can also cry during recovery. other infections, induced pertussis-like cough, recent studies have shown that pertussis occursthe mechanism is related to the damage of host cell immune function by pertussis toxins. the immune response mediated by cd4+ t cells and cytokines secreted by th1 cells plays an important role in b. pertussis infection. 2. pathological anatomy: b. pertussis invades the nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchial mucosa, mucosal congestion, polynuclear leukocytes at the base of epithelial cells, mononuclear cell infiltration and partial cell necrosis.in addition to inflammatory infiltration of the bronchus and alveolar interstitial, cytoplasmic vacuoles of epithelial cells are formed, and even the nuclear membrane ruptures and dissolves, necrosis, and shedding, but rarely affects the alveoli.if the secretion is blocked, it can cause atelectasis, bronchiectasis, secondary infection, prone to bronchial pneumonia, sometimes interstitial pneumonia; if pertussis encephalopathy occurs, microscopic examination or macroscopic examination of brain tissue congestion and edema, spotted hemorrhage , cortical atrophy, neuronal degeneration, cerebral edema, etc., at this time, liver fat infiltration and other changes are often seen.","['hanging sound when inhaling', 'sexual cough', 'chest tightness', 'lung yin deficiency', 'twitching', 'low fever', 'yan penghui', 'shocking']",['lung atelect'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
benzene poisoning,"benzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon compound obtained from fractional distillation of coal tar and petroleum cracking. it is an oily liquid with a colorless and aromatic odor.very volatile, flammable and explosive.industrially used as a solvent, diluent and chemical raw material.benzene is a moderately toxic substance that can cause acute or chronic poisoning. acute benzene poisoning refers to the pathophysiological process in which the central nervous system anesthesia is the main manifestation of oral benzene-containing organic solvents or inhalation of high concentrations of benzene vapor. the main symptoms are drunkenness, gait instability, and crying and laughing. loss of consciousness, convulsions, death from respiratory central paralysis or circulatory failure.chronic benzene poisoning means that benzene and its metabolite phenols affect the hematopoietic function of the bone marrow. the clinical manifestations are white blood cell count and continuous reduction of platelet count, and eventually develop into aplastic anemia or leukemia.it can also affect the nervous system, manifested as neurasthenia and autonomic dysfunction.","for patients with acute poisoning, you can immediately leave the site to fresh air, remove contaminated clothing, and wash contaminated skin with soap or water.oral poisoning, patients should be gastric lavage, poisoned people should rest in bed, and receive symptomatic, supportive treatment, can be given glucuronic acid.should pay attention to prevent patients with cerebral edema, remember not to use adrenaline for heartbeat, for patients with aplastic anemia caused by benzene poisoning, can be given a small number of multiple blood transfusions and glucocorticoid treatment.","inhalation of benzene vapor or skin contact with benzene caused by poisoning, there are acute, chronic points.acute benzene poisoning mainly produces anesthesia to the central nervous system, coma and muscle twitching; high concentrations of benzene have a stimulating effect on the skin.long-term low-concentration benzene can cause chronic benzene poisoning, hematopoietic disorders, and the number of common white blood cells is reduced in the early stage, resulting in a decrease in platelet count and anemia.patients may have clinical manifestations such as epistaxis, bleeding gums, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and menorrhagia. acute benzene poisoning is mostly caused by accidental or acute inhalation of organic solvents containing benzene.these organic solvents include paints, thinners, industrial glues, and the like.chronic benzene poisoning is caused by long-term inhalation of low concentrations of benzene and metabolite phenols.","['disgusting', 'twitching', 'feeling obstacle']",['anemia'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
asthmatic bronchitis,"asthmatoid bronchitis, also known as asthmatic bronchitis, refers to a group of asthmatic infantile acute bronchitis, an allergic, often associated with respiratory infections.patients often have a history of eczema and other allergies, especially in obese people, with a longer course of disease and a history of recurrent episodes.the main pathological basis of acute asthmatic bronchitis is bronchial smooth muscle spasm, microvascular leakage, mucosal edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reversible airway obstruction caused by increased secretion.the trachea and bronchus of infants and young children are relatively narrow, and the surrounding elastic fibers are well developed. therefore, the mucosa is susceptible to infection or other irritation and swelling and congestion, causing the tube to be narrow, and the secretions are sticky and difficult to cough up, thereby producing wheezing sound.breathing with expiratory dyspnea is more severe at night and may have irritating cough.wheezing can be relieved by itself or relieved after treatment. there may be no symptoms or signs in the intercourse, and some may develop into bronchial asthma.","according to the above section, for children with asthmatic bronchitis, attention should be paid to the family and children's own allergic history, eosinophilia examination, serum ige levels and so on.if bronchial asthma is suspect, early prevention and treatment of asthma should be given.","because a variety of viral and bacterial infections can be caused, more common are syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and mycoplasma pneumoniae. in most cases, bacterial infection can be caused on the basis of viral infection. the trachea and bronchus of infants and young children are relatively narrow, and the surrounding elastic fibers are well developed. therefore, the mucosa is susceptible to infection or other irritation and swelling and congestion, causing the tube to be narrow, and the secretions are sticky and difficult to cough up, thereby producing wheezing sound. because infants and young children have a large number of viral infections, only a small number of children present with asthmatic bronchitis, suggesting that the different pathophysiological changes and clinical manifestations of the same virus in different individuals are closely related to the factors in the body.for example, in recent years, children with asthmatic bronchitis caused by syncytial virus have specific ige antibodies, and the concentration of histamine in nasopharyngeal secretions is significantly higher than that of children with the same infection without wheezing. their relatives often have allergic rhinitis. history of allergic diseases such as urticaria and asthma.about 30% of children have had eczema, and serum sige levels are often increased.","['shrubbing's wheezing', 'wheeling sound', 'ciliated epithelial cell damage shedding', 'allergic cough', 'chemical bronchitis', 'wheezing', 'chronic cough in winter and spring...', ' cough with wheezing sound]",['bronchial asthma'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
adult respiratory distress syndrome,"adult respiratory distress syndrome, abbreviated as ards, is a secondary syndrome characterized by acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia.also known as shock lungs, traumatic lungs and so on.a type of acute respiratory failure in adults.causes include: shock, severe infection, craniocerebral injury, severe trauma, fat embolism during fracture, excessive transfusion infusion, dic, inhaled irritating gases, oxygen poisoning, long-term use of respirators, cardiopulmonary bypass, coma or aspiration after general anesthesia, burns, etc.although the primary damage is different, the pathophysiological changes caused by the lungs are similar. the main features are: 1 increased permeability of the pulmonary microvascular wall, interstitial edema; 2 loss of pulmonary surfactant, and collapse of the alveolar population.","patients with high-risk should be closely observed, strengthen monitoring, when the respiratory rate is low, pao2 is reduced, and other lung injury performance should be given early, respiratory support and other effective prevention and intervention measures should be taken to prevent further development of ards and important organ damage.","suppurative infections can cause bacterial toxins or cell rupture products to enter the pulmonary circulation.under the action of endotoxin, vasoactive substances are released in the body, which can increase capillary permeability.infection can also be transferred to the lungs, which can lead to pulmonary failure. the low blood volume caused by a large amount of blood loss in shock and trauma can cause a decrease in cardiac output and also a decrease in pulmonary blood flow.due to the reduction in pulmonary blood volume and the continuous receipt of microemboli from the systemic circulation, the pulmonary vascular bed can be blocked, hindering the progress of gas exchange. this is because brain trauma can stimulate strong sympathetic impulses, leading to significant peripheral vasoconstriction, followed by acute heart failure and pulmonary edema. ards is an acute alveolar-capillary membrane injury caused by many reasons. some reasons can directly damage the lungs: such as 1 inhalation of smoke, poisonous gas, stomach contents and drowning; 2 taking excessive heroin or salicylate; 3 bacteria, viruses and pulmonary infection caused by fungi, etc.; 4 fat, amniotic fluid and thrombosis caused by pulmonary embolism; and 5 lung contusion, radiation damage and oxygen poisoning.some systemic pathological processes can cause lung damage, such as sepsis, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, allergic reactions, trauma and burns. burning more than 40% of the area may lead to a significant reduction in pao2, and some treatments may also cause ards, such as hemodialysis, extracorporeal circulation, removal of white blood cells by nylon wire, and the like. according to the different causes and characteristics of the lesions, ards has more than 20 names, such as post-traumatic wet lung, sepsis lung, shock lung, post-transfusion lung, microvascular leakage syndrome, congestive atelectasis, hyaline disease, emerging lung syndrome, zombie syndrome, progressive lung consolidation, etc. pathological changes in adult respiratory distress syndrome the pathological changes of acute alveolar-capillary membrane damage caused by various causes are similar, and can be divided into acute stage and chronic stage lesions: (1) acute stage lesions mainly for pulmonary edema caused by extensive alveolar vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelial damage, first of all, interstitial edema, alveolar edema, lung weight up to three times normal, high liquid protein content in alveolar cavity, even bloody liquid, there are blood cells, macrophages, cell debris, amorphous substances, fibrin strips and residues of surface active substances. occasionally, substances such as cell debris and proteins form transparent membranes in fibrin mesh. (two) chronic stage lesions after a few days of onset, the disease enters the chronic phase. the lesions are mainly cell proliferation. fibrosis can occur after two weeks. type ii epithelial cell hyperplasia replaces degenerative necrotic type i alveolar epithelial cells, and the infiltration of various cells increases the alveolar septal increase. thick, alveolar cavity and protein-rich liquid in the alveolar duct are mechanized to form fibrosis. pathogenesis of adult respiratory distress syndrome the pathology of ards is mainly caused by pulmonary edema and pulmonary cell edema and subsequent cell proliferation and fibrosis. the mechanism of cell proliferation and fibrosis is the same as the process of inflammatory repair. therefore, the mechanism of acute lung injury is emphasized here. patients with ards have pulmonary hypertension, so some people emphasize that pulmonary microvascular hypertension is the cause of pulmonary edema, but the patient's pulmonary wedge pressure is often not high, indicating that capillary pressure is not necessarily high, and the edema fluid is rich in protein. animal experiments have also proved that in the animal model similar to ards, the lung lymph fluid flow rate increases, and the ratio of protein concentration in plasma lymph fluid to plasma protein concentration is greater than 0.7; at this time, intravenously injected polymer dextran (molecular weight 500,000) can penetrate into alveolar fluid, indicating pulmonary edema in ards is mainly osmotic pulmonary edema, which is caused by increased permeability due to alveolar-capillary membrane damage. the mechanism of increased alveolar capillary membrane permeability in ards has not been fully elucidated. some primitive causes can directly damage the alveolar capillary membrane to increase its permeability, such as inhalation of gastric acid, poisonous gas, smoke, radiation damage and cytotoxic effects. .a large number of experiments have shown that the more important is secondary damage, that is, the alveolar-vascular membrane damage caused by the accumulation of white blood cells and platelets in the lung causes its permeability to increase. (1) the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of ards the number of neutrophils in the peripheral blood of patients with ards is reduced. the lung biopsy shows neutrophil accumulation and infiltration in the lung. the neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage can be increased by 20 to 100 times. nowadays, neutrophils are generally considered. aggregation, activation, release of oxygen free radicals, proteases and lipid metabolites in the lungs, leading to damage to the pulmonary microvascular membrane and alveolar epithelium, is the main pathogenesis of ards pulmonary edema. 1. neutrophils accumulate in the pulmonary blood vessels: about 10-20% of neutrophils accumulate in the pulmonary capillary bed in normal human steric position, which is a physical detainment due to the proximity of an alveoli segmental capillaries, each capillaries are 1 to 30 米m long (average 8 米m), with a diameter of 1 to 15 米m (average 5 米m). a blood cell passes through more than 100 capillary segments, neutrophils from the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary vein. the diameter is larger than the capillary diameter, and its shape is closer to the spherical shape than the red blood cells, so the deformability is poor and the deformation speed is slow, so the neutrophils are easily detained in the pulmonary capillary bed.due to the large capacity of the pulmonary capillary bed, the detainment of white blood cells has little effect on the resistance of the pulmonary blood vessels and the pulmonary artery pressure. the physically detained neutrophils generally do not enter the alveolar space, so the cells in the normal human bronchoalveolar eluate 90 to 95% are macrophages. the accumulation of neutrophils in the pulmonary vasculature during ards is a chemical adhesion, which is the result of the action of chemokines. experiments have shown that neutrophils are activated by chemokines and between vascular endothelial cells. the affinity is significantly enhanced, the total area of alveolar capillaries reaches 60m2, and a large number of neutrophils can be adhered, so that the number of white blood cells in peripheral blood is reduced. there are many types of chemokines, mainly complement activation products c5a, fibrin degradation products (fdp), arachidonic acid metabolites such as leukotriene b4 (ltb4), hydroxyrachhipenoic acid (hete) and thromboxane a2 (axa2). ), platelet activating factor (paf), and other chemotactic proteins, peptides and lipids, among which the more studied is the role of complement, plasma c5a is often elevated 8 hours before clinical diagnosis of ards, activated complement it does not directly damage pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. it activates neutrophils to cause damage, and the complement of sheep perfusion activation can cause pulmonary edema.if the granulocytes are reduced with nitrogen mustard and then reperfused and activated, the occurrence of pulmonary edema is significantly better. activated neutrophils can be infiltrated into the pulmonary interstitium and into the alveolar space. in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of ards patients. there are complement fragments and a large number of neutrophils. in recent years, it has been found that there are a group of glycoproteins on the surface of neutrophils, which are related to the adhesion and phagocytosis of granulocytes. they are macrophage-1 (mac). -1) lymphocyte function associated antegen-1 (lfa-1), in which mac-1 is most closely related to adhesion function, and only a small amount of mac-1 is expressed on the surface of normal neutrophils. under pathological conditions, the action of chemokines increased the expression of mac-1 on the surface of neutrophils and promoted the adhesion between neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells. 2, neutrophil damage to alveolar-capillary membrane: intravenous injection of endotoxin, air and other models of acute pulmonary microvascular injury in animal experiments, activated with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) perfusion of neutrophils into isolated lungs can also increase pulmonary capillary permeability, such as reducing the number of neutrophils in animals with hydroxyurea, nitrogen mustard, etc., endotoxin, air emboli, etc. the damage was significantly alleviated. it was found in the cell culture that the neutrophil secreted tightly adhered to the endothelial cells to increase the permeability of the monolayer pulmonary artery endothelium. the above description was alleviated. it was found in the cell culture that the neutrophils must adhere closely. endothelial cells can increase the permeability of the monolayer pulmonary artery endothelium. the above indicates that the adhesion and activation of neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of ards, most likely the release of oxygen free radicals during neutrophil activation. proteases, lipid metabolites, and peptides cause damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane. (1) effect of oxygen free radicals: when neutrophils are activated, the oxygen consumption increases sharply, increasing several times to several tens of times than when resting. at this time, nadph oxidase on the cell membrane is activated. converting reduced coenzyme ii (nadph) to oxidized form (nadp), oxygen molecules obtain electrons to form superoxide anion o2-, and o2- can also generate h2o2 and oh, together with normal neutrophils and their activator pma perfusion of isolated lung can cause pulmonary edema, high protein content in edema fluid; such as neutrophils and pma perfusion in patients with hereditary chronic granulomatosis do not cause pulmonary edema, because of neutropenia in patients with chronic granulomatosis nadph oxidase, the generation of oxygen free radicals is small, in addition, intravenous injection of oxygen radical scavengers, such as superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase, peroxidase, dimethyl thiourea, etc. to alleviate acute lung injury in experimental animals, it can be seen that neutrophils activate lung damage by releasing oxygen free radicals. oxygen free radical damage to lung microvascular endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells may have the following aspects: 1 acting on the cell membrane and organelle membrane, causing lipid peroxidation, thereby impairing the structure and function of cell membrane and cell membrane; 2 acting on enzyme, inactivated; 3 acts on 汐1-protease inhibitor, inactivates it, thereby enhancing the destruction of tissue by lysosome-releasing protease; 4 acting on plasma components can form a strong chemoattractant, causing more neutrophils accumulate and activate in the lungs, producing more oxygen free radicals, which form positive feedback and aggravate lung damage. (2) the role of protease: lysosomes in neutrophils contain a variety of neutral proteases and acid proteases. when neutrophils are activated or destroyed, these enzymes can cause decomposition and tissue structure of surrounding proteins. destruction, the permeability of alveolar-capillary membrane is increased, among which neutrophil elastase is more studied. for example, it is found that the activity of elastase in bronchoalveolar eluate of ards patients is very high, and the animals are injected. when the toxin or oleic acid replicates the ards model, the elastase content in the plasma and alveolar eluate also increases; the injection of neutrophil elastase into the animal can increase the permeability of the pulmonary vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium; liver and alveolar macrophages can synthesize 汐1-protease inhibitor (汐1-pi), which inhibits elastase, although plasma 汐1-pi in ards patients can be normal, 汐1-pi in bronchoalveolar eluate the activity is reduced, which may be caused by the oxidative inactivation of free radicals produced by neutrophils. the imbalance between protease and protease inhibitors further damages the tissue damage of the protease and increases the permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane. 3, the role of lipid metabolites: endotoxin and many other pathogenic factors activate neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, endothelial cells and other cell membrane phospholipase a2, membrane phospholipids are cleaved into arachidonic acid, after prostaglandins are produced by cyclooxygenase, and leukotrienes are produced by the lipoxygenase pathway. it is generally believed that leukotrienes, txa2, and pgf2汐 can both contract pulmonary arterioles to cause pulmonary hypertension and increase pulmonary microvascular permeability. pgi2 and pge1 have the effect of dilating blood vessels, lowering blood pressure, and reducing vascular permeability. in animals and patients with acute lung injury, alveolar eluates and blood txa2, pgf2汐 and lts are increased. experiments have shown that pgi2 and pge1 has a certain therapeutic effect on acute lung injury. when activated by white blood cells, macrophages, mast cells and endothelial cells, platelet activating factor (paf) can also be released. paf can promote platelet aggregation and txa2 synthesis, resulting in microvascular permeability. sexual increase. 4, the role of protein substances after the activation of macrophages and other protein substances can be released, the most important of which are tumor necrosis factor (tnf) and interleukin iil-1), human and animal plasma during endotoxemia increased tnf and il-1, tnf can increase pulmonary vascular permeability and promote neutrophil accumulation in the lung; il-1 stimulates t lymphocytes to produce interleukin-2 (il-2), the latter it also increases pulmonary vascular permeability. in conclusion, it is now generally believed that neutrophil macrophages accumulate in the lungs, activate and release a large number of oxygen free radicals and proteases and lipid metabolites and proteins, causing damage and permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane. lead to pulmonary edema, which is the main pathogenesis of ards. although patients with leukopenia have sepsis can also develop acute lung injury, the use of drugs to make animal neutropenia has no significant effect on lung injury caused by oleic acid, but these facts are not sufficient to deny the pathogenic role of neutrophils, because the number of neutrophils in the peripheral blood does not necessarily reflect the number of granulocytes in the pulmonary circulation, and how much neutrophil activation is needed to cause acute lungs. the damage is not known, and only a part of the neutrophils that normally accumulate in the pulmonary blood vessels are activated enough to damage the lungs and cause ards. (b) the role of coagulation system in the pathogenesis of ards lung biopsy and postmortem anesthesia in ards patients found that pulmonary arterial thrombosis can occur before pulmonary congestion, edema, hemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation, ards patients with diffuse intravascular coagulation, hypoxemia and lung compliance sexual downsizing is much heavier than those without dic. proliferating substances released by neutrophil activation and lung tissue damage, pulmonary vascular endothelial injury and blood stasis can lead to platelet aggregation and intravascular coagulation to form microthrombus, in the lungs. extensive microthrombus formation may cause: 1 increased pulmonary circulation resistance increases pulmonary arterial pressure, unblocked pulmonary vessels increase blood volume and capillary pressure, leading to pressure pulmonary edema; 2 vascular activity of blood vessel wall and platelet release from thrombus injury the substance is degraded by fibrin, which can increase vascular permeability and cause osmotic pulmonary edema; 3 platelet consumption, anticoagulant effect of fibrin degradation products, and damage of blood vessel wall can cause intrapulmonary hemorrhage; 4 platelet release 5- media such as ht contract the bronchi and affect lung ventilation. in recent years, the role of fibrin degradation products (fdp) has been particularly noticeable. in patients with severe traumatic burns or infections, the level of fdp in the blood of patients with combined ards is much higher than that of those without ards, and there is a certain parallel relationship between the disease of ards and the concentration of fdp. the fibrin fragment d (fd) is injected into the blood vessels of rabbits. causes progressive peripheral blood thrombocytopenia, leukocyte infiltration in the interstitial lung, increased pulmonary vascular permeability and pulmonary insufficiency; such as injection of plasma albumin, fibrin and fibrin fragments e, the above lesions do not occur, it is likely to be small plate there are fd-specific membrane receptors, which bind to fd to activate platelets, causing platelet aggregation and release reactions. in addition, fd is also a chemotactic compound that promotes the accumulation, adhesion and activation of neutrophils in the lungs. aggravate lung damage. the permeability of normal pulmonary capillary endothelium is 10 times higher than that of alveolar epithelium. the change of pulmonary capillary permeability in ards is earlier than that of alveolar epithelium. therefore, pulmonary interstitial edema occurs first, then alveolar edema occurs, and alveolar epithelial damage causes ii. the reduction of surfactants produced by epithelial cells can lead to atelectasis and a functional shunt. in systemic pathological processes such as sepsis, shock, etc., neutrophils adhere to the vascular endothelium and tissue damage caused by intravascular coagulation, not only in the lungs, but also in the liver, kidney, intestine, heart, endocrine organs, etc. at the office. therefore, ards can not be regarded as only lung damage, but the blood flow of the lung is the largest, and the area of the capillary bed is also the largest, so the lung is the most affected, so that the patient mainly presents with acute respiratory failure. pulmonary respiratory function changes in adult respiratory distress syndrome. outer respiratory dysfunction caused by ards is mainly caused by alveolar ventilation-blood flow imbalance, plus diffuse dysfunction, manifested as hypoxemia respiratory failure, and extremely severe cases have total hypercapnia respiratory failure can occur when alveolar ventilation is reduced. (a) alveolar ventilation - imbalance of blood flow due to the loss of surfactant-induced production of type ii alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar edema caused by the dilution and destruction of surfactants, and the consumption of surfactants caused by alveolar hyperventilation, resulting in alveolar increased surface tension, decreased lung compliance, resulting in atelectasis, resulting in functional shunt and true shunt, neutrophils and other media released by leukotrienes to shrink the bronchi, and edema fluid block small airways, gas it can cause pulmonary dysfunction and form a functional shunt. the ards patient can achieve a flow rate of up to 30% of the pulmonary blood flow, microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary blood vessels, vascular active substances cause uneven pulmonary vasoconstriction, and pulmonary interstitial edema on the blood vessels. compression can not only increase pulmonary vascular resistance, but also increase pulmonary artery pressure, which can increase dead cavity-like ventilation. therefore, alveolar ventilation-blood flow imbalance is the most important cause of respiratory failure in patients. (b) diffuse dysfunction pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema, the formation of transparent membrane and chronic stage cell proliferation and pulmonary fibrosis, can increase the thickness of the diffuse membrane, leading to diffuse dysfunction. (3) reduction of alveolar ventilation the distribution of pulmonary lesions in ards is uneven, restrictive ventilation caused by decreased lung compliance and obstructive ventilation caused by small airway obstruction, resulting in partial alveolar ventilation reduction, unaffected or lighter alveolar compensatory ventilation is enhanced, and excessive carbon dioxide is discharged, so the patient's paco2 is reduced. when the alveolar-capillary membrane damage is more extensive and severe, the total alveolar ventilation of the whole lung will be reduced, and co2 will be retained and hypercapnia will occur. at this point pao2 will drop further. pulmonary ventilation disorder, pao2 reduces the stimulation of vascular chemoreceptors, pulmonary hyperemia and pulmonary edema stimulate the j sensor, causing the patient's respiratory distress, the juxtapulmonary capillary receptor is located next to the alveolar capillaries, can feel capillary pressure spine excited, pulmonary congestion, pulmonary edema is stimulated by stimuli to cause rapid breathing.","['difficulty breathing', 'purple', 'cardiac respiratory distress']",['bacterial pneumonia'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
large amount of amniotic fluid inhalation,"the fetus inhales a larger amount of amniotic fluid during intrauterine or childbirth and refers to a large amount of alcoholic fluid inhalation (also known as amniotic fluid inhalation syndrome (aminoticfluidaspirationsydrom).generally speaking, amniotic fluid is not contaminated, often has a transient difficulty breathing or bruising, mild symptoms and good prognosis.such as the inflammatory reaction in the lungs, known as amniocentesis pneumonia.","the key to prevention is prevention of intrauterine or hypoxia in the fetus. it is very necessary for the mother to do prenatal checkup regularly. when the fetus has signs of intrauterine asphyxia, the delivery should be terminated as soon as possible. the longer the hypoxia, the possibility of inhaling amniotic fluid. and the amount of amniotic fluid inhaled will be larger, and long-term intrauterine hypoxia can also cause fetal brain damage. in the moment when the child is delivered, the child's nose and mouth, pharyngeal cavity and amniotic fluid in the atmospheric tube should be intubated as soon as possible to avoid the child's birth. when crying, the amniotic fluid in these areas is inhaled into the deeper lungs, which further aggravates the condition.proper treatment of fetal distress during prenatal delivery avoids and reduces inhalation as much as possible. the fetal head is delivered before the first breath is removed or the oropharynx is removed with a disposable pipette. the nasal mucus is extremely important and the key to reducing the onset. health care, nursing staff through the suffocation resuscitation treatment and qualified to go to work is necessary for amniocentesis aspiration pneumonia after treatment, the prognosis is good, most children can heal, and leave no sequelae.","any factor causes hypoxia in the fetus or intrauterine.as hypoxemia stimulates the fetal respiratory center, wheezing-like respiration occurs, causing amniotic fluid to be inhaled into the respiratory tract. amniotic fluid is quickly absorbed by the alveolar capillaries after inhalation. sebum in the amniotic fluid and exfoliated keratinized epithelial cells can cause chemical chemistry in the alveoli. diffuse pneumonia occurs with mechanical stimulation, which reduces the gas diffusion function. abnormal labor is also called dystocia.its main feature is that the progress of the labor process is slow and prolonged.factors that cause abnormal delivery include productivity, birth canals, fetuses, and maternal psychosocial factors.prolonged labor will increase maternal and child complications during childbirth, and severe cases can directly endanger mother and child life. intrauterine distress is caused by fetal hypoxia, most of which occurs after labor, but can also occur during pregnancy.intrauterine distress is a common cause of fetal perinatal death and neonatal nervous system sequelae, accounting for the first cause of perinatal death.can be divided into acute fetal distress and chronic fetal distress. fetal weight ≡ 4000g is called a huge fetus.difficulties often occur in the normal birth canal, there are many opportunities for shoulder dystocia, and surgery is needed for midwifery. if the treatment is improper, soft birth canal injury or uterine rupture can occur.","['face of bruises', 'difficulty breathing', 'lips and blues', 'lung texture thickening', 'have a continuous cyanosis after birth', 'lips and nail bed slightly blue-purple', 'be out of breath']",['respiratory failure'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['symptom treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

building disease syndrome,"building disease syndrome has a variety of manifestations, all caused by exposure to a variety of harmful substances.people who work in the office, or people who work in densely populated buildings.most often occur in new confined buildings that do not open windows in order to reduce heat dissipation. heating and cooling pipes are installed in the building, which are sent from the same place.elevated co2 is the most common phenomenon in these buildings and is a common cause of building disease syndrome.the patient becomes anxious, hyperventilated, and then develops into hand and foot convulsions and severe breathing difficulties.","the daily prevention of building disease syndrome should not be immediately moved into office or residence after the completion of the new building. attention should be paid to the use of natural ventilation to discharge dirty and toxic gases in the building to keep the indoor air fresh and clean.it is recommended that people who work indoors for a long time get up every two hours, not only can move the body, but also refresh the brain, enhance heart and lung function, and at the same time drink plenty of water, and put some green plants indoors to beautify the environment and regulate the air. humidity also prevents dry skin and respiratory system. building disease syndrome health education healthy indoor air quality must be created by architects, interior designers, building operators and users.the attitude of the building owner and the company's operators is particularly important because it is difficult for employees to make specific improvements on a personal level, so when the boss finds that the employee has experienced physical discomfort, they don't think they exaggerate the cold, and one day they don't when you complain again, you may be sick and unable to continue working at home.the current architectural concept in europe is to open every window of the skyscraper. each room has its own air conditioning. every employee can get close to a window and get enough sunshine and air.","in the building of a high-rise building, the air contains dangerous dust.this is because smoking or the use of natural gas, gas, detergents, paints, adhesives, etc., constantly release a variety of organic chemicals.because people in high-rise buildings spend a long time indoors, and the ventilation is not good, the air will be thickened. they are all emitting electromagnetic waves of different energies and frequencies to the space. due to the concrete slabs of the building, the electromagnetic waves are swaying in the building like ghosts. these electromagnetic waves can affect the inherent current and magnetic waves of the human body, leading to irregular heartbeats. and neurasthenia. various new materials and decorative materials such as indoor plastic flooring, wallpaper, furniture, paints, etc., often contain varying degrees of toxic components.these substances can be absorbed into the blood circulation system through the absorption of the human respiratory tract and skin, affecting the body's immunity, leading to the occurrence of symptoms.","['nervous dizziness', 'nervous headache', 'intermittent dizziness', 'nasal congestion', 'dizziness', 'disgusting', 'eye itch', 'eye red', 'intermittent headache']",['depression'],"['other departments', 'other synthesis']","['supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
carbon disulfide poisoning,"carbon disulfide (cs2) is a chemical solvent widely used in industry, and is also used in viscose fiber, carbon tetrachloride, and pesticide production.it is a colorless and volatile liquid with aroma and industrial products with a bad radish smell.carbon disulfide poisoning refers to central nervous system damage caused by inhalation of high concentration of carbon disulfide vapor due to accidents during production. in acute poisoning, the state of drunkenness is drunk, gait is unstable, and the sensation is abnormal. in severe cases, excitement may occur, and sputum may occur in severe cases. coma, convulsions, and even paralysis of the respiratory center lead to death.","the maximum allowable concentration of cs2 in the air of workshops in china is 10mg/m3. some research results suggest that this sanitation standard needs to be revised to ensure the health of operators.cs2 operators should be given physical examinations and regular examinations after induction, including internal medicine, neurology and ophthalmology examinations, and if necessary, neuroelectromyography, blood lipids, electrocardiogram and other examinations.those with organic nervous system diseases, various mental illnesses, retinopathy, coronary heart disease or diabetes should not be engaged in cs2 operations.","causes of the disease: industrial production of carbon disulfide: common in the drawing workshop of chemical fiber plant using viscose disulfide to make viscose fiber, and in the production of cellophane, thiocyanate and other chemical production.since carbon disulfide has strong corrosive effects on metals, wood and rubber, the production equipment and pipelines are highly susceptible to corrosion and accidents such as running, dripping, leaking or sudden rupture, resulting in acute poisoning. unprotected use of carbon disulfide: in the wool processing industry where carbon disulfide is used for wool degreasing, the dry cleaning industry used as a stain remover for clothes, and as a fumigant for seed disinfection and pest control, granaries, or protection, in the poor ventilation environment, too long to inhale a large amount of high concentration of carbon disulfide gas, causing acute poisoning. production process of carbon disulfide: in the production process of producing carbon disulfide by using sulfur vapour into a burning charcoal fire, such as simple equipment or inadequate protection measures, acute poisoning may occur due to inhalation of a large amount of carbon disulfide concentrated vapor. carbon disulfide enters the human body through the respiratory tract and can also be absorbed through the skin and gastrointestinal tract. after entering the body, 10 to 30% is still excreted through the lungs, and 70% to 90% is excreted from the urine by metabolism. the mechanism of cs2 poisoning has not been clarified, mainly the following possible possibilities: 1. the cs2 metabolite dithiocarbamate binds to vitamin b6, causing some enzymes such as transaminase with pyridoxal as a coenzyme to be inhibited. 2, dithiocarbamate and trace elements, such as zinc and cytochrome oxidase in some dehydrogenase, dopamine 汕-hydroxylase in copper, so that the enzyme loses activity, interfere with energy and catecholamine metabolism, damage the nervous system, especially the extrapyramidal system. 3. cs2 inhibits monoamine oxidase activity and causes serotonin accumulation in the brain, which may be related to toxic psychosis. 4, cs2 inhibits the activity of lipoproteinase and lipid scavenging factor in plasma, resulting in lipoprotein and lipid metabolism disorders, 汕-lipoprotein can penetrate into the arterial wall, leading to glassy changes, arteriosclerosis.","['coma', 'tendon reflex disappears', 'vomiting', 'delirium', 'multiple neuritis', 'shallow sensation loss or absence', 'nausea', 'sensory disorder']",['coma'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
pulmonary-pleural amebiasis,"pulmonary-pleural amebiasis is a lung and pleural suppurative inflammation caused by the infection of amoeba. the hepatic lesions occur mostly in the right lower lung, and the blood-borne lesions are mostly multiple lesions in both lungs.in the case of parenteral amebiasis, the incidence of lung and pleural amebiasis is second only to the liver, and the right side of the chest amoebia is frequent and mostly secondary to the hepatic amoebic abscess near the diaphragm, and the hepatic amoebic abscess it is a late complication of intestinal amebiasis.","daily prevention of lung-pleural amebiasis the disease is prevalent in the world, and is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. however, in colder regions and even in the arctic circle, there are also amoebic infections and epidemics, and the infection rate is high and low. the economic situation and eating habits are closely related. it is estimated that about 10% of the world's people are infected, and some local infection rates can be as high as 50%. the distribution in china is generally higher in rural areas than in cities. the improvement of living standards, acute amoebic dysentery and abscess cases, except for a few areas, have been relatively rare, mostly in the form of chronically prolonged or typical cases and insects. (1) source of infection: chronic patients, convalescent patients and healthy insects are the source of infection for this disease. the capsule has strong resistance. in humid and low temperature environment, it can survive for more than 12 days, and can live 9~ in water. 30 days, but the capsule is weak against dryness, high temperature and chemical drugs. for example, when it is 50 ～c, it will die for a short time. the survival time in a dry environment is only a few minutes. in 0.2% hydrochloric acid, 10% to 20% salt. water and soy sauce, vinegar and other condiments cannot survive for a long time, and 50% alcohol can kill it quickly. (2) route of transmission: there are several ways to spread the amoeba in the lysate: 1 the contaminated water source in the capsule can cause an outbreak in the area. 2 in the case of manure as a fertilizer, unwashed and uncooked vegetables are also important transmission factors. 3 cysts contaminate fingers, food or utensils to spread. 4 both flies and cockroaches can be exposed to feces, carry and vomit feces on the surface, and encapsulate the contaminated food as an important medium of transmission. (3) popular characteristics: the amebic disease in the lytic tissue is widely distributed. in temperate regions, the disease can be prevalent, while in the tropical and subtropical regions, the prevalence is particularly serious. since the liberation of our country, the infection rate of amoeba has been significantly reduced. for example, beijing capital hospital examined 38 075 cases from 1973 to 1978, with a positive rate of 0.52%; fujian medical university in 1976, 216 children in hui'an, the positive rate was 4.63%; northeast jiamu medical college report (1980), inspection of suburban high school students in 487 cases, the positive rate was only 0.4%; in 1979, a total of 557 large-scale farmers were removed from the yueqing county, zhejiang province, with a positive rate of 3.2%. the incidence of the disease varies from time to time, with more in autumn and second in summer. females, more adults than children, may be associated with swallowing foods containing cysts or age.","causes of the disease: there are more than 10 species of amoeba parasitic in the human body. only the lytic amoeba is pathogenic to the human body. the trophozoite is a parasitic form of the protozoa. the body exists in the form of large and small trophozoites and cysts. trophozoites are pathogenic, and small trophozoites are intermediate transition types between trophozoites and cysts. mature cysts are infectious and have strong resistance to external abilities. they survive in feces for more than 2 weeks and survive in water for more than 5 weeks. it is the only form of disease transmission, and the pathogenic amphibole encodes a proteolytic enzyme gene, which has an important impact on the ability to invade tissues. pathogenesis: 90% of amoeba infections are recessive infections, and 10% of invasive amebiasis.this depends mainly on the characteristics of the infected strain, and also on the host's immune status, nutritional status and resistance. when the person swallows the food or water contaminated by the capsule, the capsule reaches the small intestine because of the anti-acidic effect. in the lower part, by means of the catalytic action of trypsin, the cystic worms are decapsulated, split into small trophozoites, and settle in the intestinal lumen. under normal colonic function, the small trophozoites stop moving and secrete the cyst wall to form cysts. excreted with feces, when the host body's resistance is reduced or intestinal dysfunction, small trophozoites invade the intestinal wall, multiply and transform into large trophozoites. the pathogens directly contact and adhere to target cells, phagocytose, dissolve tissue cells, nourish the body releases hydrolyzed protease to cause tissue lysis and necrosis, and at the same time resists complement, adheres to the neutrophils involved in the body's response, releases more enzymes, aggravates tissue inflammation and destruction, and forms abscesses. lung, chest and abdomen amebiasis 90% of liver-derived, can be perforated by the liver abscess to the pleura and lung; through the liver, sputum, lung adhesion at the interstitial space, blood vessels invade the lung; through the hepatic vein into the inferior vena cava to the lung and pleural, intestinal-derived trophozoites enter the lungs from the intestinal wall lesions through the intestinal lymphatic vessels, the thoracic duct into the superior vena cava or the lower rectal vein into the inferior vena cava.","['night sweats', 'diarrhea', 'lack of strength', 'fever with cough, slightly...']",['amoebic liver abscess'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"

of pulmonary hemorrhage, rapid glomerulonephritis and serum anti-glomerular basement membrane (gbm) antibody-positive triad.most patients progress rapidly and the prognosis is dangerous.","pulmonary hemorrhage - nephritis syndrome can quickly kill. the cause of death is often pulmonary hemorrhage and respiratory failure. in the acute phase, tracheal intubation is often required, assisted ventilation and hemodialysis. subsequent treatment relies on the use of high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone daily 7-15 mg/kg, divided intravenously), immunosuppressive cyclophosphamide and repeated hemodialysis to exclude anti-glomerular base membrane antibody. the course of immunosuppressive therapy has changed a lot.","respiratory tract infections and influenza virus infection are the most common causes of this disease. recent studies have found that patients with acquired immunodeficiency disease are infected with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and the body is prone to produce anti-gbm antibodies. calderon et al reported 4 cases. three of the hiv-infected patients were positive for anti-type iv collagen 汐3 chain antibody (anti-gbm antibody), suggesting that alveolar damage can induce pulmonary hemorrhagic-nephritis syndrome in pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. scleroderma is a connective tissue disease characterized by localized or diffuse skin and connective tissue

attack the glomerulus and lung, type ii allergic reaction, as well as immune complexes to alveolar and glomerulus there is no definitive explanation for the pathogenesis of deposition and activation of complement (type iii allergy). in 1962, steblay et al. confirmed that glomerular basement membrane (gbm) damage in pulmonary hemorrhagic-nephritis syndrome was mediated by anti-gbm antibodies, and a large amount of research work focused on the isolation and study of gbm components in search of antibodies. the corresponding antigen and the molecular structure and characteristics of the antigen. in recent years, with the rapid development of molecular biology and biochemistry, the nc1 domain of the 汐3(iv) chain was confirmed in the newly discovered 汐3(iv) chain of collagen iv. it is goodpasture's own antigen, also known as goodpasture antigen, and then cloned the antigen gene co14a3, which is located in the q35-37 region of the second chromosome. indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that goodpasture antigen is not only found in gbm, but also in renal tubular basement membrane (tbm), alveolar capillary basement membrane (abm) and other tissue basement membranes (such as choroid, cornea, crystal, retinal blood vessels). the basement membrane and so on, but the pathogenic goodpasture antigen is mainly distributed in gbm, tbm and abm. the occultity of the antigen causes the reversibility of the exposure process. the 汐3nc1 structure can be exposed in vitro by 6 mol of guanidine hydrochloride or a strong acid condition of ph 3. domain, but how the body antigen is exposed and produces an immune response damage gbm is not fully understood, it is speculated that under physiological conditions goodpasture antigen is concealed in the collagen iv汐3nc1 domain, various predisposing factors (toxins, viral infections, bacterial infections, tumors, immune genetic factors and endotoxin can activate epithelial, endothelial and mesangial cell proliferation, and release inflammatory mediators (il-1, rds, prostaglandins, neutral proteases, etc.), gbm, etc. under the action of cellular enzymes, collagen iv high-level structure dissociation, exposure of goodpasture antigenic determinants, stimulation of the body to produce antibodies, resulting in immune damage, due to the whole body hair in the vascular endothelium, only the endothelial layer of the glomerular capillaries has a window, so that the antibody can be directly contacted with the gbm antigen and cause disease, while the abm is only subject to certain external factors (such as infection, smoking, inhalation of gasoline or organic solvents). after the effect, the integrity of the basement membrane antigen is exposed to the lungs after exposure, which is why the kidney is most susceptible and the degree of involvement is consistent with the antibody titer, and the degree of involvement of the lung is inconsistent with the antibody titer. the frequency of hla-dr2 and other antigens in patients with this disease was significantly increased (up to 89%, normal control was only 32%), and the use of gene dna restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis also showed that the disease and hla-dr4, hla-dq汕 chain gene dqwlb and dqw3 related, indicating that hla class ii antigen-associated lymphocytes play a role in this disease. some experiments have found that if only anti-gbm antibodies are given to the test animals, gbm can form a line-like deposition, but it does not occur, and only enter the diseased animals at the same time. after t cells, the test animals only developed disease, which confirmed that t cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. recent studies have also found that certain cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and il-1 can aggravate the development of this disease. pulmonary lesions showed pulmonary fullness and swelling, and there were many bleeding spots on the surface. under the light microscope, there were a lot of red blood cells in the alveolar cavity and many macrophages containing hemosiderin. the alveolar wall was focally thickened and fibrosis. the alveolar cells

wall is linearly deposited, and some patients are positive for antibody igg on the basement membrane of the distal convoluted tubule. previously, this symptom was mainly caused by the desorption of the basement membrane (gbm) antibody. immunofluorescence showed that igg was deposited along the glomerular basement membrane. only a part of this disease can be diagnosed as pulmonary hemorrhagic-nephritis syndrome, and another part of the patient. the clinical resembles pulmonary hemorrhagic-nephritis syndrome, but its immunofluorescence shows that igg is deposited along the gmb in granular form, and the anti-gbm antibody is negative in the blood. actually, this part of the case is immune complex nephritis (icgn), and the autoimmune mechanism starts from this disease. the important role, manifested as icgn, is caused by the deposition of immune complexes in the corresponding parts of the glomeruli and alveoli. clinically, the lung lesions appear before the renal

alveolar proteinosis,"pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (pap) is a rare disease of unknown cause.it is characterized by the deposition of insoluble phospholipid-rich proteins in the alveoli or in the bronchial lumen.it occurs in young and middle-aged people, and the incidence of men is about three times that of women.the cause is unknown, and it is speculated to be related to several factors: such as a large amount of dust inhalation (aluminum, silica, etc.), decreased immune function (especially infants and young children), genetic factors, alcoholism, microbial infections, etc.although the triggering factor is not clear, it basically agrees that the pathogenesis is caused by lipid metabolism disorder.that is, the metabolism of alveolar surfactant is abnormal due to the action of internal and external factors.pathological examination characterized by a protein-like substance in the alveoli filled with periodic acid-stained schiff (pas) staining, first reported by rosen in 1958.alveolar proteinosis can be classified as primary, secondary, and congenital depending on the cause.the main clinical symptoms are shortness of breath, cough and cough. the typical symptoms are shortness of breath after the activity, and they feel anxious when they progress to rest.chest x-ray showed diffuse lung infiltration shadows in both lungs.the diagnosis is mainly based on bronchoalveolar lavage examination or pathological diagnosis by fiberoptic bronchoscopy or thoracotomy.the coughed sputum was fixed with 80% ethanol, and pas stained with 15% positive lipid.try proteolytic enzymes for aerosol inhalation or intermittent positive pressure breathing apparatus.bronchopulmonary lavage is the only proven treatment to date.bronchoalveolar lavage through the bail, the deposition of surfactants deposited in the alveoli, thereby improving lung ventilation and ventilation function, in many cases can only temporarily relieve symptoms, need to be repeated on a regular basis.","1, to avoid infection with mycobacterial disease, karst lung cyst pneumonia, cytomegalovirus and so on. 2, pay attention to exercise, improve immunity.","the so-called low immune function is a pathological feature. generally speaking, human immunity is the ability of our body to resist invasion in the face of external invasion. for example, when ubiquitous bacteria and stubborn viruses attack you, the resistance of your body directly determines whether you will get sick. drinking exceeds the standard for moderate drinking or general social drinking. heavy drinking is often determined by exceeding a certain amount of daily drinking (eg 3 standard cups per day) or per drinking (eg 5 standard cups at a time, at least once a week). genetics generally refers to the phenomenon that the traits of the parent are expressed in the next generation, but genetically refers to the phenomenon that the genetic material is passed from the upper generation to the offspring. microbial infection refers to infection with bacteria, mold, trichomoniasis, mycoplasma, and the like. a large amount of dust inhalation refers to the inhalation of dust such as aluminum or silica. (1) the cause of the disease although the starting factor is still unclear, it basically agrees that the pathogenesis is caused by lipid metabolism disorder, that is, due to the abnormal metabolism of alveolar surfactant caused by external factors in the body, so far, more research the activity of alveolar macrophages is demonstrated by animal experiments. the activity of macrophages after phagocytosis of dust is significantly decreased. the granules of macrophages in the lavage fluid of patients can reduce the viability of normal cells. after treatment with bronchoalveolar lavage, the activity of alveolar macrophages can be increased, but the study found no increase in type ii cell-producing protein and no abnormality in systemic lipid metabolism. therefore, it is generally believed that this disease is associated with decreased clearance. (b) pathogenesis 1. the pathogenesis of alveolar proteinosis is not fully understood, there are several hypotheses: (1) surfactant clearance disorder: it was observed by electron microscopy that alveolar protein deposits and whole lung lavage were structurally similar to lamellar surfactants secreted by type ii alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting alveolar protein deposition. may be associated with alveolar surfactant metabolism disorders, most of the evidence currently suggests that alveolar protein deposits may be due to alveolar surfactant clearance disorders, rather than excessive production, normal alveolar surfactant (sp) production with clearing is a complex dynamic process, alveolar type ii epithelial cells not only synthesize and secrete alveolar surfactants, but also participate in the clearance of alveolar surfactants along with alveolar macrophages, when certain factors such as infection, drugs, etc. the function of alveolar type ii cells changes, leading to a decrease in the clearance of alveolar surfactants, which leads to the deposition of surfactants in the alveoli. recent studies have also found that surfactant protein a (sp-a) can not only regulation of surfactant secretion and regulation of alveolar type ii epithelial cells alveolar macrophages on pulmonary surfactant reuptake, their role in the pathogenesis of pap unclear. (2) alveolar macrophage function defects: many scholars have found that alveolar macrophages in patients with alveolar proteinosis have low chemotactic activity, phagocytic function and decreased phagolysosome activity, and gonzalez et al. report normal human alveoli. when macrophages are co-cultured with alveolar lavage fluid in patients with alveolar proteinosis, normal human alveolar macrophages lose their phagocytic capacity, suggesting that alveolar macrophages are present in the alveolar lavage fluid of patients with alveolar proteinosis. factors, recent studies suggest that alveolar macrophage dysfunction may be associated with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) deficiency or with gm-csf/il-3/il-5 receptor beta chain defects. (3) secondary to other diseases: clinically some diseases, especially hematological malignancies, can occur alveolar proteinosis, such as myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, fanconi anemia and igg-type immunoglobulin disease, although the literature reports the malignancy of the blood system the average incidence of secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in tumors is about 5.3%, but the incidence of secondary myeloid leukemia patients can be as high as 10%, unlike primary alveolar proteinosis, secondary alveolar protein deposition the disease is often focal, and the symptoms are mild, usually without bronchoalveolar lavage. (4) abnormal injury of inhaled substances: alveolar proteinosis may be related to certain physical and chemical factors and mineral dust inhalation, such as busulfan, chlorambucil, whisk and aluminum dust, etc. animals inhaled dust particles it can also cause alveolar proteinosis. these suggest that alveolar proteinosis may be associated with certain physical and chemical factors and mineral dust inhalation, but in humans, there is no direct evidence in epidemiological studies that alveolar proteinosis is associated with these substances. (5) gene mutation: alveolar surfactant-associated protein b (sp-b) gene mutation has been confirmed to be associated with congenital alveolar proteinosis (cpap), and it has been confirmed that there are at least two mutation sites in the sp-b gene. one is that the 121st base c is replaced by the 3 base gaa, and the other is the 1st base t deleted at the 122nd position. both gene mutations can cause sp-b deletion in the alveolar surfactant. however, the clinical manifestations of congenital alveolar proteinosis vary widely, suggesting that there may be other sites or new sp gene mutations involved. (6) abnormalities of gm-csf and its receptors: in 1994, dranoff et al found that there was protein-like deposition in the alveoli of mice that had removed granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), which was followed by many scholars. studies have shown that patients with alveolar proteinosis have a disorder of cytokine regulation, ie, elevated il-10 expression and decreased expression of gm-csf and loss of gm-csf/il-3/il-5 receptor beta chain. happening. in conclusion, the pathogenesis of alveolar proteinosis is not fully understood, and none of the above mentioned causes can fully explain all cases and further research is needed in the future. 2. pathological manifestations (1) visual observation: most of the lungs are solid, diffuse yellow or grayish yellow nodules or small plaques can be seen under the pleura. the diameter of the nodules varies from a few millimeters to 2 cm. visible yellow liquid can be seen on the cut surface. outflow, if not infected, the surface of the pleura is smooth. (2) light microscopy: the alveolar and bronchial lumens are filled with a non-morphological, periodic acid-rich substance that is positive for periodic acid staining (pas). the alveolar septum is normal or the number of alveolar septa is increased, but there is no obvious fibrosis in the interval. there is no inflammation in the alveolar cavity except for the occasional discovery of macrophages. (3) electron microscopy: there are a large number of layered structures in the debris in the alveolar cavity, composed of coiled three layers of phospholipids, which are similar in structure to alveolar surfactants.","['chest pain', 'purple', 'breathing difficulty', 'alveolar inflammation', 'alveolar lavage fluid visible...', 'sufficiency', 'fever with cough, slightly...']",['respiratory failure'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment, symptomatic treatment']"
pulmonary aspergillosis,"the pathogens of pulmonary aspergillosis are mainly aspergillus fumigatus, and a few are aflatox, earthworm, black bacillus, bacillus sphaeroides, kohlrabi, and koji.in china, about 300 cases of respiratory tract infections were reported from 1949 to the end of 1988. however, with the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in recent years, the incidence of aspergillus infections such as long-term use of hormones and tumor radiotherapy and chemotherapy has increased significantly.most of the pulmonary aspergillosis is secondary infection, the primary is less common, and can also be seen in a small number of normal immune.clinically, the disease is generally divided into three types: koji ball, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (abpa) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (ipa).","when working in an environment suspected of being infected with aspergillus, protective work should be done, such as wearing a protective mask to avoid inhaling a large number of germs. when operating in fungal laboratories, such as aspergillus, a. acumin, and aspergillus, it is necessary to operate take care to prevent these bacteria from being inhaled into the lungs.","pulmonary aspergillosis is mainly caused by aspergillus fumigatus.the bacterium is parasitic in the upper respiratory tract and can only cause disease if the body's immunity is reduced in patients with chronic diseases. there are aspergillus spores everywhere in the air. in the autumn and winter and the rainy season, when the stored grain grass is hot and mild, it is more.inhalation of aspergillus spores does not necessarily cause disease, and a large amount of inhalation can cause acute tracheal-bronchitis or pneumonia.the disease is often secondary to existing diseases in the lungs, such as bronchial cysts, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, lung abscesses and so on.the endotoxin of aspergillus causes tissue necrosis, and the lesion is invasive, consolidation, peribronchial inflammation or miliary chronic lesions.","['cough out brown sputum', 'eosinophilic', 'chest pain']",['allergic rhinitis'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['anti-aspergillus drug treatment', 'symptomatic support treatment', 'some chronic infections such as aspergillus need surgical resection']"
radiation pneumonitis,"radiation pneumonitis is an inflammatory reaction caused by radiation damage in normal lung tissue in the radiation field after radiotherapy in lung cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, malignant lymphoma or other malignant tumors of the chest.mild asymptomatic, inflammation can dissipate on its own, some patients have old-fashioned lesions; the severe lungs are extensively fibrotic, leading to respiratory damage, resulting in respiratory failure.","the key to the prevention and treatment of radiation pneumonitis lies in the following three points: ""prevention"": "" 1) strictly control the radiation dose: generally, the conventional dose of 2500 rad is safe within 5 weeks. (2) control the radiation field, the larger the radiation field, the higher the incidence rate. (3) select an appropriate irradiation rate, preferably 800-1000 rad per week. once the disease is found, treatment should be started as soon as possible to block the progression of the disease. if extensive pulmonary fibrosis has occurred, the prognosis is poor.","(1) the cause of radiation the occurrence of radiation pneumonitis, the severity of lung injury is closely related to the radiation area, the amount of radiation, the rate of radiation and the method of radiation. generally, the radiation dose threshold is safer at 25 gy for 5 weeks. radiation dose rarely produces radiation pneumonitis in 20gy within 6 weeks. in the same time, the dose exceeds 40gy, the incidence of radiation pneumonitis reaches 100%, and the radiation dose exceeds 60gy, which can cause severe lung injury. the larger the radiation, the more the incidence high, the more serious the lung injury, the lung tissue damage caused by large-area irradiation treatment at the same large dose is far more serious than the local lung irradiation. the faster the irradiation speed, the more likely the lung injury is caused, and other influencing factors such as the individual's radiation sensitivity, the original diseases of the lungs such as pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, interstitial lung disease, etc. or the second radioactive exposure are easy to promote the occurrence of radiation pneumonitis, radiotherapy for thyroid cancer, throat tumors, including frequent ct examinations can also cause lung damage, radiation pneumonitis, poor tolerance of radiotherapy for the elderly and children, chemotherapypulmonary toxicity may increase due to radiation-induced lung damage with drugs (eg bleomycin). (b) pathogenesis the pathological changes of radiation pneumonitis can be divided into acute radiation inflammatory changes and chronic fibrotic lesions, acute inflammatory changes occur more than 1 to 2 months after radiation therapy, can also occur 6 months after the end of radiotherapy, mainly manifested as pulmonary capillaries, small arterial congestion, dilatation and embolism, increased vascular permeability, swelling of alveolar cells, increased type ii alveolar cells and alveolar macrophages, lymphatic vessel expansion and formation of transparent membranes in the alveoli, lymphoid cells in the alveolar wall cell infiltration, acute self-dissipation, connective tissue hyperplasia and fibrosis, lung tissue changes in the chronic phase are extensive alveolar fibrosis, alveolar septal thickening, alveolar atrophy, thickening of blood vessel wall, vitreous change and sclerosis, tube stenosis or obstruction of the lumen results in decreased gas exchange function and increased pulmonary artery pressure. secondary pulmonary infection can promote radiation pulmonary fibrosis, which is also an important cause of death.","['yan tie', 'pulmonary fibrosis', 'chest pain', 'low heat']",['emphysema'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['drug symptomatic treatment, early may require hormone therapy']"
lung candidiasis,"lung candidiasis is a common pulmonary fungal disease caused by infection with candida (mainly candida albicans).the disease is mostly secondary infection, which occurs in the case of decreased body resistance.clinically, it can be divided into three types: (1) bronchitis type.(2) pneumonia type.(3) allergic type.the pathogen is mainly candida albicans, followed by candida tropicalis, candida highis and candida albicans.candida infections have been reported to account for 79% of fungal infections, especially in intensive care units, burns and oncology.","1. do not abuse broad-spectrum antibiotics. 2. long-term application of antibiotics, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs should be regularly checked for feces, urine, sputum, etc., and carefully performed physical examination, if necessary, regular chest x-ray examination. 3. for those who must apply antibiotics and glucocorticoids for a long time, antifungal drugs such as nystatin, ketoconazole and fluconazole can be administered intermittently. 4. the medical staff should wash their hands before and after touching the patient to avoid cross infection.","normal human skin, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, etc. have parasitic parasitic, normal disease does not cause disease, when the body's immune defense function declines, colonization in the oral cavity, candida in the upper respiratory tract can invade the respiratory tract and cause endogenous infection. intra-hospital cross-infection can cause exogenous infections, indwelling catheters, mucosal ulcers and other damage to the mucosal integrity, can also cause candida to invade the body, the lungs can be primary infections, but also part of the blood-borne disseminated candida. unclean lungs can also cause lung candidiasis. pathogenesis bronchopulmonary candidiasis is mainly caused by inhalation (primary), that is, candida colonized in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract is caused by the lower respiratory tract and alveoli when the body's defense mechanism is weakened. after candida invades the tissue, it turns into mycelial type, multiplication, mycelium of candida has anti-phagocytic ability, causing acute inflammatory reaction of leukocyte infiltration, ulceration, multiple microabscess and tissue necrosis, chronic infection with granulomatous lesions and fibrous tissue hyperplasia the blood-borne type is a hemorrhagic nodule composed of hyphae and yeast invading into the blood vessel, causing diffuse damage to both lungs, typically characterized by necrotic lung tissue and mass-produced candida.","['sticky ' , ', 'pulmonary voice']",['bacteria'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['antifungal therapy, symptomatic treatment,', 'supportive treatment']"
lung bullae,"pulmonary bullae refers to the balloon-containing cavity formed in the lung tissue due to various reasons such as increased pressure in the alveolar space, rupture of the alveolar wall, and fusion with each other.more than 1 cm in diameter, often occurs on the basis of emphysema, generally secondary to inflammatory lesions of small bronchi, such as pneumonia, emphysema and tuberculosis, clinically most common with emphysema.the mechanism of occurrence is similar to that of emphysema but to a greater extent.pulmonary bullae are both congenital and acquired.congenital more common in children, due to congenital bronchial dysplasia, mucosal folds are valvular, chondrodysplasia, caused by the action of the valve.acquired is more common in adult and elderly patients, often with chronic bronchitis and emphysema.at present, most of the bullous surgery can be done under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and 2/3 of the patients have obvious improvement in postoperative symptoms.","since the cause of the formation of bullous bullae is not clear, any measures that can prevent the formation of small bronchial inflammation flaps can be taken.such as smoking cessation, to avoid catching cold, enhance physical fitness, prevent bronchopulmonary infection.","(1) the cause of the disease the bullae are caused by the high alveolar swell, the rupture of the alveolar wall and the fusion of each other, which is usually caused by the occlusion of the small bronchi, which is the same as the formation of emphysema, but to a greater extent. the alveolar alveolar diameter of more than 1 cm occurs in the lung parenchyma, often accompanied by different lung diseases, such as chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma, advanced silicosis or sarcoidosis, and some lung bullae found in the lungs and bronchi without disease. patients, pulmonary bullae secondary to pneumonia or lung abscess are more common in infants and young children, there are single and multiple, due to inflammatory lesions, small bronchial mucosa edema, resulting in partial obstruction of the lumen, resulting in a valve effect, air it can enter the alveoli and is not easy to discharge. the pressure in the alveoli is increased, and the alveolar space is gradually broken due to the increase of the pressure inside the bubble. it is a huge balloon-containing cavity, which is called a bullous bullous in clinic. secondary to tuberculosis, most of them are single, and there is no obvious emphysema. secondary to emphysema, often multiple, in addition to bullae, often accompanied by most vesicles. (b) the pathogenesis of the bullae wall is very thin, composed of squamous epithelial cells of the alveoli or only fibrous membrane, and can coexist with a variety of emphysema, common in the side of the interval or subarachnoid emphysema, with or without carbon deposition, they were found in the pneumoconiosis and scar tissue emphysema of coal miners. the bullae were divided into three pathological forms. type i: occurs mostly in the middle or lingual leaves, and is also common in the upper lobe of the lung. it may be due to the negative pressure in the chest, which protrudes from the surface of the lungs, and has a narrow band connected to the lungs. the valvular obstruction formed by scar tissue, the enlarged volume of pulmonary bullae is due to alveolar collateral ventilation and gas retention. the type i lung bullae is thin, often formed by the pleura and connective tissue. the lung can be found on conventional x-ray films. the presence of bullae. type ii: between the visceral pleural and emphysema lung tissue, the superficial base of the superficial pulmonary bullae is located in the surface of the lung, connective tissue space can be seen in the bullous cavity, but it does not constitute the wall of the bullae. can be seen in any part of the lungs. type iii: is a deep basal deep bullae, the structure is similar to type ii, but the site is deep, surrounded by emphysema lung tissue, lung bullae can be extended to the hilar, visible in any lung lobe. when the volume of the lung bullae increases, the surrounding lung tissue is compressed and causes the lungs to shift. the compressed lung tissue is on the chest x-ray, which shows the density increase around the bullae, and the above 3 types are found in chronic bronchitis. associated with chronic diffuse obstructive pulmonary disease, lobular central emphysema does not involve pulmonary bullae, and lower lobe bullae are common in coal mine workers with pneumoconiosis and concomitant silicosis with complications.","['chest tightness', 'short breath', 'chest suffocation', 'fever with cough, slightly...']",['tensional pneumothorax'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['rehabilitation treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
pneumococcal pneumonia,"pneumococcal pneumonia is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, accounting for more than half of community-acquired pneumonia.acute onset, there are symptoms of chills, high fever, chest pain, cough and blood stasis.in recent years, due to the wide application of antibacterial drugs, clinical symptoms are mild or atypical diseases are more common.pneumococci usually pass through the upper respiratory tract to the lungs.they stay in the bronchioles to proliferate and cause inflammatory processes, and begin to produce a large amount of protein in the alveolar cavity. this liquid acts as a medium for the culture of the pathogen and can help the bacteria spread to the adjacent alveoli. the typical result is that the large leaves are caused. pneumonia.","1. moderate exercise and enhance immunity.avoid situations that cause immunity, such as drunkenness, overwork, and rain. 2. vaccination.","when the respiratory defense function is weakened, the respiratory tract is infected by the virus, destroying the integrity of the bronchial mucosa, and easily inducing bacterial infection.common in cold, fatigue, hunger, drunkenness, anesthesia, coma, immunodeficiency disease, congestive heart failure and so on. the number of invading bacteria is large and the virulence is strong.after the invasion of bacteria, it will inevitably be resisted by the body's immunity. only when the number of invading bacteria is large and the virulence is strong, it will cause disease beyond the resistance of the body. pathogenesis pneumococcal is usually inhaled and reaches the lungs through the upper respiratory tract.they stay in the bronchioles to proliferate and cause inflammatory processes, and begin to produce a large amount of protein in the alveolar cavity. this liquid acts as a medium for the culture of the pathogen and can help the bacteria spread to the adjacent alveoli. the typical result is that the large leaves are caused. pneumonia. the initial stage of lobar pneumonia is hyperemia, characterized by a large amount of serous exudate, vasodilation and rapid proliferation of bacteria.the next stage is called ""red liver-like change"", that is, the solid lung has a liver-like appearance: the air cavity is filled with polymorphonuclear cells, blood vessel congestion and extravasation of red blood cells, so the naked eye is reddish.this is followed by a ""grey liver-like change"" phase in which fibrin accumulation is associated with white blood cells and red blood cells at different stages of decomposition, which are filled with inflammatory exudates.the final stage is the dissipation period characterized by exudate absorption.","['blood with bloodshots', 'cough with chest pain', 'chest pain', 'fever with cough, slightly...']",['septicemia'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
emphysema,"emphysema refers to the airway elasticity of the distal bronchioles (breathing bronchioles, alveolar duct, alveolar sac and alveoli), excessive expansion, inflation and increased lung volume or accompanied by pathological changes of the airway wall. .according to the cause of the disease, emphysema has the following types: senile emphysema, compensatory emphysema, interstitial emphysema, focal emphysema, paraventricular emphysema, obstructive pulmonary qi swollen.","1. the first is to quit smoking. 2, pay attention to keep warm, avoid cold, prevent colds. 3. improve environmental sanitation, do personal labor protection, eliminate and avoid the effects of smoke, dust and irritating gases on the respiratory tract.","various factors that cause chronic stagnation, such as infection, smoking, air pollution, long-term inhalation of occupational dust and harmful gases, allergies, etc., can cause obstructive emphysema. the theory of the imbalance of elastase and its inhibitors. studies of the relationship between 汐1-antitrypsin deficiency and emphysema suggest that emphysema is caused by an imbalance of protease and anti-protease content in the lungs, which disrupts alveolar septum, and an animal model of massive emphysema supports this hypothesis, humans emphysema studies have shown that the concentration of elastin is increased in patients with emphysema, smoking can increase elastin activity, inhibit lung fibroblast infiltration, resulting in increased tissue sensitivity to elastase, inhibiting resistance the activity of elastase, which is found to support smoking, breaks the balance between elastase and anti-elastase, causing damage to the fine structure of the lungs and causing emphysema. pathogenesis 1. pathological changes of emphysema: emphysema is the abnormal enlargement of alveolar and alveolar duct caused by various causes and the destruction of alveolar wall, which increases the amount of residual gas in the lung. according to the extent of the affected alveoli, it is divided into small leaf center type. emphysema (often located at the tip of the lung), total lobular emphysema (often at the base of the lung) and distal lobular emphysema, total lobular and lobular central emphysema associated with smoking, both types of emphysema often coexist and are evenly distributed in the upper or lower lobe of the lung. when emphysema is severe, tracheal obstruction also develops. the recurrent bronchial inflammation causes tracheal obstruction and pulmonary interstitial destruction. the mechanical support force of the trachea is lost, causing it to collapse and obstruction of the trachea, thereby causing an increase in gas in the lungs and forming an air cavity. 2, emphysema pathophysiology: the function of respiratory muscles in the emphysema patients have significant changes, other respiratory assisted muscles, intercostal muscles can not work on the normal length-tension curve, the degree of swelling of the diaphragm muscles, so that when the contraction is performed, sufficient intrathoracic negative pressure cannot be formed. when the diaphragm is flattened, the lower thorax is pulled downward during contraction, and the lungs are squeezed, which has a reverse effect on the respiratory effect, causing the diaphragm to become larger when the diaphragm is contracted. the function is converted to exhalation, the destruction of the alveolar wall structure reduces the capillary bed of the lung, the destruction of the pulmonary microcirculation increases the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the pulmonary blood flow resistance of the emphysema patient is inversely related to the co diffusion capacity of the lung. therefore, before pulmonary hypertension occurs in patients with emphysema, there must be serious damage to the gas exchange function.","['industrial vertebrae expansion', 'barrel-thorax', 'small bronchial mucosal edema', 'sticky or purulent sputum with...', 'low diaphragm', 'chest tightness', 'exhalation sound extension' , 'lung sounds', 'breathing sound weakened']","['respiratory failure', 'spontaneous pneumothorax', 'chronic pulmonary heart disease', 'stomach ulcer']","['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"

lung abscess,"lungabscess is a purulent lesion of the lung tissue caused by a variety of causes, early purulent inflammation, followed by necrosis to form abscess.it happens mostly in the prime of life, more men than women.according to the cause of the disease, there are three types of infections caused by tracheal infection, blood-borne infection, multiple abscesses and lung cancer. lung abscess can also be classified according to related pathogens, such as staphylococcal and anaerobic bacteria. or aspergillus lung abscess, the incidence of lung abscess has been greatly reduced since the widespread use of antibiotics.","1. pay attention to the prevention and treatment of oral and upper respiratory tract chronic infections, so as to prevent the chance of inhalation of the lower respiratory tract by contaminated secretions. for oral and thoracic and abdominal surgery cases, it is necessary to carefully prepare for the operation and pay attention to the depth of anesthesia during surgery. timely removal of oral cavity, respiratory clots and secretions, strengthen postoperative oral respiratory care, such as careful use of sedation, analgesic and cough medicine, emphasis on respiratory humidification, dilute secretions, encourage patients to cough, keep the circulation of the respiratory tract, and effectively prevent inhalation infection of the respiratory tract. 2, active treatment of skin spasm or extrapulmonary purulent lesions, do not squeeze sputum, can prevent the incidence of blood-borne lung abscess, active treatment of respiratory infections such as sinusitis, tonsillitis.in particular, it is highly important to control measles, hundred cough, bronchial pneumonia, lung abscess and tuberculosis in childhood, which is of great significance in preventing the occurrence of lung abscess. for patients with lung abscess, inhaled toxic smoke, harmful dust, etc. reduce the severity of lung abscess.","the cause of lung abscess is bacterial infection, bronchial obstruction, and reduced systemic resistance. the primary abscess is caused by inhalation of pathogenic bacteria or pneumonia. the secondary abscess is based on existing lesions (such as obstruction). caused by extrapulmonary dissemination, bronchiectasis and/or immunosuppressive state, common pathogenic factors: 1. teeth, periodontal infection: unconsciousness, abuse of alcohol or sedatives, epilepsy, head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes coma and failure due to other diseases cause cough reflexes to disappear and aspiration. 2, swallowing disorder: benign or malignant esophageal stenosis, medullary paralysis, achalasia, pharyngeal sac presence caused by aspiration. there are many bacteria that can cause lung abscess, and most of them are mixed infections, generally consistent with upper respiratory tract and oral bacteria, including aerobic, facultative anaerobic and anaerobic bacteria: such as pneumococcus, staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic chain cocci, proteus, klebsiella, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus, etc.; anaerobic bacteria such as streptococcus mutans, aspergillus, clostridium nucleatum, etc. in recent years, due to advances in culture techniques, the rate of inhaled anaerobic infection can be as high as 90%. the occurrence and development of lung abscess often have the following three factors: 1 bacterial infection. 2 bronchial obstruction. 3 systemic resistance is reduced, there are two common types of clinical common causes: blood source infection and tracheal infection, blood source infection, mainly caused by sepsis and sepsis, lesions are often frequent, mainly using drug treatment, mainly tracheal infection bacterial secretions from the respiratory tract or upper digestive tract, after sleep, coma, drunkenness, anesthesia or seizures, cerebrovascular accidents, inhalation into the trachea and lungs, causing obstruction of the small bronchus, reducing the body's resistance next, it will induce lung abscess. abdominal and inflammatory changes occur in the lung segment of the distal end of the bronchial obstruction, which in turn causes pulmonary tissue necrosis and liquefaction in the pulmonary vascular embolism. an inflammatory reaction occurs in the surrounding pleural lung tissue, and finally a certain amount of abscess is formed. after the abscess is formed, in the acute and subacute stages, such as bronchial drainage is not smooth, infection control is not complete, then gradually transferred to the chronic stage, in the process of repeated episodes of infection, staggered and degenerated, the affected lung and bronchi are both damaged and organized repair; there are lesions of the lung tissue, and there are lesions of the bronchial pleura; both acute inflammation and chronic inflammation; mainly manifested as a abscess in the lung tissue, surrounded by interstitial inflammation and varying degrees of fibrosis, related bronchi produces varying degrees of obstruction and dilation. chronic lung abscess has the following three characteristics: 1. the abscess site begins to occupy the superficial part of the lung segment or lung lobe. 2. the abscess is always connected to one or more small bronchi. 3, the abscess spreads outward, and in the late stage, it is not restricted by the lung segment and the boundary of the lung, but can form a destructive lesion of multi-chamber cavity that communicates with each other across the segment and across the leaf. causes necrotizing pneumonia. such as urinary tract infection, abdominal pelvic abscess, left heart endocarditis, infection caused by various cannula, infectious thrombotic vasculitis. such as bronchiectasis, bronchial blockage (tumor, foreign body, congenital abnormalities). pathogenesis: lung abscess can be classified according to the onset time and pathogenic bacteria. the acute lung abscess does not exceed 4-6 weeks, and the chronic abscess time is longer. inhalation of bacteria-containing pollutants into the lungs through the mouth and nose, blocking a segment or a small segment of the bronchus, causing distal atelectasis, local bacteria rapidly multiply and grow, produce inflammation, small blood vessel embolism, lung tissue is quickly necrotic, liquefaction after about 1 week into the abscess, the abscess enlarges, destroys the surrounding small bronchi, the pus can be discharged from the atmospheric tube, forming a purulent cavity, the volume varies, single or multiple, can occur in any part of the lung, multiple small abscess (<2cm) the formation is related to pneumonia or lung gangrene. the abscess after partial necrosis is a solid tumor. it does not discharge pus into the bronchus. it is like a tumor. the abscess is mostly under the pleura of the lung. however, there is inflammation adhesion in the early stage of the pleura. there is not much rupture into the pleura into the empyema or pus pneumothorax. in the acute phase, if the drainage is smooth, the pus is discharged smoothly, and with the drug treatment, the lesion can gradually heal, leaving a small amount of fibrous tissue, such as strong virulence and inappropriate treatment. if the bronchial drainage is not smooth, the lesions will expand, and the pulmonary fissure will have little effect on the infection. the lesions often invade the adjacent segments and adjacent leaves, and even affect the whole lung. if the bronchi has a occlusion, it can form. tensionable cavity, easy to break into the chest. if the acute abscess is not controlled in time, the lung inflammation and the abscess prolonged to 2 to 3 months, it becomes a chronic lung abscess, the lungs are destroyed in many places, the sinus is twisted in the middle, and the lesion is destroyed at the same time. organized repair, the abscess gradually thickens the wall of the fiber, the bronchus is invaded by inflammation and the opening is blocked, resulting in different degrees of expansion, the abscess can be at rest, or the infection can be spread due to sputum spill, lung tissue fibrosis and contraction, the pleura forms a tight adhesion due to repeated inflammation. the systemic circulation forms many vascular communication with the pulmonary circulation. there are thick blood vessels in the adhesion, and even systolic or continuous vascular murmur (pleural adhesion murmur) can be heard on the body surface. the adhesion of the hilar is very tight, and the bronchial artery is enlarged and enlarged. gravity and aspiration are the determinants of the diseased lung segment. therefore, the anterior and posterior superior anterior and posterior segments of the lower lung are aspirational sites, accounting for 85% of the lung abscess. the supine lung abscess occurs in the supine lung. the right side is more than the left side, the right lower back leaf section is the most common, because the right total bronchus and the midline angle are small, and thicker, the pollutants are easy to enter, the same reason, the lower leaf back section, the upper part of the upper lobe, ""axilla"" is multiple, in the right anterior segment, the middle lobe and the tongue segment of the lung abscess, should be suspected of some obstruction of the trachea or swallowing abnormalities and other incentives.","['chest pain', 'circle in the lungs is substantial...', 'lung pain', 'sticky or purulent sputum with...', 'bloody blood in the sputum', ' pus sputum ', 'to liqin', 'cough with scorpion finger', 'opening of the lungs']",['pneumothorax'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
pulmonary embolism,"pulmonary embolism refers to the pathology and clinical state of the appendage entering the pulmonary artery and its branches, blocking the blood supply to the tissue.common emboli are thrombus, and the rest are rare new biological cells, fat droplets, air bubbles, intravenously-loaded drug particles, and even pulmonary vascular occlusion caused by the tip of the catheter.since lung tissue is subjected to dual blood supply to the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery, and gas exchange can also be performed directly between the lung tissue and the alveoli, most pulmonary embolism does not necessarily cause pulmonary infarction.","although embolism of pulmonary embolism can be derived from any systemic and right atrial compartment of the body, it is most often derived from deep veins of the lower extremities.therefore, the most important prevention of pulmonary embolism is for lower extremity thrombophlebitis and thrombosis, active treatment of foot infections (including ankles) and prevention of varicose veins; once acute thrombophlebitis occurs, bed rest, lower limb reduction activities, apply antibiotics and anticoagulants at the same time. surgery and trauma should reduce bedtime and encourage early bed-out activities; if you need to stay in bed for a long time, you should regularly do active and passive activities of the lower limbs to reduce blood stasis.in addition to active treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases, patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease should also reduce bed rest and preventive anticoagulant therapy when there is evidence of thrombosis or embolism.for long-distance travel, the flight attendant should move the lower limbs in time to prevent thrombosis. suspected venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis can do lower limb impedance volume map, vascular ultrasound doppler, radionuclide or conventional venography, etc., in order to timely diagnosis, early treatment.for patients with ""primary"" (hereditary) hypercoagulable state or family history of deep vein thrombosis - pulmonary embolism, defects in coagulation mechanisms such as atiii, c protein, s protein and plasminogen should be examined and found early. lack of, etc., after the onset of life should be anticoagulation, and actively install the inferior vena cava filter. the key to preventing pulmonary embolism is to prevent the primary disease.","thrombosis pulmonary embolism is often a complication of venous thrombosis. embolons are usually derived from the deep veins of the lower extremities and pelvis, causing embolism by circulation to the pulmonary arteries; but rarely from the upper limbs, head and neck veins. stasis of blood flow, increased blood coagulation, and venous endothelial injury are contributing factors to thrombosis. therefore, trauma, long-term bed rest, varicose veins, venous cannula, pelvic and hip surgery, obesity, diabetes, contraceptives or other causes of hypercoagulability, etc., are prone to induce venous thrombosis. early thrombosis and the role of the fibrinolytic system, the highest risk of pulmonary embolism in the first few days of thrombosis. heart disease is the most common cause of pulmonary embolism in china, accounting for 40%. several times, all kinds of heart disease, combined with atrial fibrillation, heart failure and subacute bacterial endocarditis have a higher incidence. right heart chamber thrombosis is most common, and a few are also derived from the venous system. in addition to subacute bacterial endocarditis, bacterial emboli can also be caused by pacemaker infection. the former infectious emboli is mainly from the tricuspid valve. occasionally, the mitral palsy of the congenital heart can be diverted from the left heart to the right heart and reach the pulmonary artery. tumors are the second cause in china, accounting for 35%, which is much higher than 6% abroad. lung cancer, digestive system tumors, choriocarcinoma, leukemia, etc. are more common. only about one-third of malignant tumors complicated with pulmonary embolism are tumor thrombi, and the rest are thrombosis. it is speculated that tumor patients may have thromboplastin (thromoboplastin) and other substances that can activate the coagulation system such as histone, cathepsin and proteolytic enzymes. therefore, the incidence of pulmonary embolism in tumor patients is high, and may even be its first symptoms. pregnancy and childbirth pulmonary embolism in pregnant women several times the age of paired non-pregnant women, the highest incidence of postpartum and caesarean section. increased intra-abdominal pressure during pregnancy and hormonal relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and pelvic vein pressure can cause slow venous blood flow, alter blood rheology and aggravate venous thrombosis. in addition, with the increase in coagulation factors and platelets, the plasma pro-plasmin-plasmin proteolytic system activity decreased; but these changes are not absolutely different from pregnant women without thromboembolism; amniotic fluid embolism is also a serious complication of childbirth. other rare causes are fat embolism caused by long bone fractures, air embolism caused by accidents and decompression sickness, parasites and foreign body embolism. in the absence of significant triggering factors, a reduction in hereditary anticoagulant factors or an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitors should also be considered. pathological changes most acute pulmonary embolism can involve multiple pulmonary arteries. the embolization site is more right lung than left lung, lower lobe than upper lobe; but rare embolism in the right or left pulmonary artery trunk or riding across the pulmonary bifurcation.when the thromboembolism is poor, the surface of the cardiac pathway is gradually covered with endothelial-like cells. after 2 to 3 weeks, it is firmly attached to the artery wall and the blood vessels are reconstructed.early emboli retraction, recanalization of blood flow, cellulose, platelet aggregates and thrombolytic processes covering the surface of the embolus can produce new emboli to further embolize small blood vessel branches.whether the embolus causes pulmonary infarction is determined by the size of the affected vessel, the extent of the obstruction, the ability of the bronchial artery to supply blood flow, and the appropriate ventilation of the obstructed area. the histological features of pulmonary infarction are intra-alveolar hemorrhage and alveolar wall necrosis, but inflammation is rarely found.when there is no lung infection or the embolus is non-infectious, there is very little void.loss of pulmonary surfactant in the infarct area can lead to atelectasis, common oozing on the surface of the pleura, and 1/3 of blood.if it survives, the infarct will eventually form a scar. after pulmonary embolism, the physiological dead space is increased, and the ventilation efficiency is reduced. however, since acute pulmonary embolism can stimulate ventilation, increase respiratory rate and minute ventilation, it usually offsets the increase of physiological dead space and keeps paco2 from increasing or even decreasing. alveolar hyperventilation has nothing to do with hypoxemia, and can not even be eliminated by oxygen inhalation; the mechanism is still unclear, presumably related to the reflection of lung parenchyma in the vascular embolization area.although paco2 is usually reduced, co2 retention may occur when neuromuscular disorders, severe pleural pain, and severe pulmonary embolism do not correspondingly increase the physiological dead space of increased ventilation compensation. pao2 is common in acute pulmonary embolism, and the ventilatory/blood flow ratio imbalance may be the main mechanism. local bronchoconstriction, atelectasis and pulmonary edema are the anatomical basis.if the cardiac output cannot be consistent with the metabolic needs, the mixed venous oxygen partial pressure will decrease, which may further aggravate the ventilatory/blood flow ratio imbalance and hypoxemia.","['right heart failure', 'chest pain', 'breathing difficulty', 'hemoptysis', 'hypoglycemic hypothermia', 'arrhythmia', 'hair sputum', 'large hemoptysis', 'malignant pleural effusion', 'cardiopulmonary embolism ']",['heart-borne shock'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
pneumonia,"pneumonia refers to inflammation of the terminal airway, alveolar and interstitial lungs, which can be caused by disease microorganisms, physical and chemical factors, immune damage, allergies and drugs.bacterial pneumonia is the most common form of pneumonia and one of the most common infectious diseases.pneumonia is mainly referred to as pneumonia caused by bacterial infection. this pneumonia is also the most common type. before the application of antibiotics, bacterial pneumonia is a great threat to the health of children and the elderly. the emergence and development of antibiotics once made the mortality rate of pneumonia has dropped significantly, but in recent years, despite the use of strong antibiotics and effective vaccines, the overall mortality rate of pneumonia has not decreased or even increased.","1, usually keep cold and warm, in case of climate change, change clothing at any time, physically susceptible, can often wear drugs like yupingfeng scattered to prevent external sensation. 2. avoid inhaling dust and all toxic or irritating gases. 3. strengthen physical exercise and enhance physical fitness. 4, when eating or feeding, attention should be concentrated, requiring patients to chew slowly, avoid eating while saying that food is inhaled into the lungs. health education: 1, diet guide into high protein, high calorie, high vitamin digestible semi-liquid food.patients with pneumonia with fever should pay attention to drinking more water, which not only can make the body's water loss be supplemented, but also facilitate the excretion of bacterial toxins and lower body temperature.eat more fruits, don't eat a lot of spicy and greasy food.for pneumonia patients with chronic pneumoconiosis, pay attention to eating high-protein foods. 2. rest and activities should be kept in bed, keep warm, keep indoor air fresh, and encourage patients to take deep breath and cough every 1h.patients in bed should pay attention to turning over, and the patient should be drained once every 4 hours.appropriate activities during the recovery period, should increase the rest time, adhere to deep breathing exercise for at least 4-6 weeks, which can reduce the incidence of atelectasis; also avoid respiratory tract irritation, such as dust, chemical droplets, etc.; crowded places or patients with existing respiratory infections.","pneumococcal bacteria generally reside in the nasopharynx of normal people, and generally do not develop disease. when the body's immunity declines, such as cold, fatigue, chronic bronchitis, chronic heart disease, long-term smoking, etc., pneumococci can invade the human body, causing pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis, meningitis, endocarditis, sepsis, etc. pneumonia can be caused by pneumococcal, hemolytic streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. coronavirus, adenovirus, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and other viruses can cause pneumonia. fungi such as candida albicans, aspergillus, and actinomycetes can cause pneumonia. pneumonia can be caused by atypical pathogens such as legionella, mycoplasma, chlamydia, rickettsia, toxoplasma, and protozoa. physical and chemical factors such as radioactivity, gastric acid inhalation, and drugs can cause pneumonia.","['beep and cheeks when exhaling', 'cough foam mucus', 'breathing difficulty', 'cough with chest pain', 'cough', 'cough', 'sustained fever', 'cough rust sputum', 'fever with cold war', 'malignant pleural effusion']",['bronchopneumonia'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
lung bubble,"pulmonary bullae is a pathological term, which refers to the increase of pressure in the alveolar space due to various reasons, the alveolar wall ruptures and fuses with each other, and the balloon-containing cavity formed in the lung tissue.the size can range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters, and even up to tens of centimeters.at present, most of the alveolar bullae surgery can be performed under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (vats), and 2/3 of the patients have obvious improvement in postoperative symptoms.","1. early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment are the fundamental principles of prevention and treatment. 2. the body is slender and long, usually a sporty or tired person who is panting, is a high-risk group of lung bullae, should pay attention. 3. pulmonary bulls should be able to exercise properly, especially if you are not holding your breath. 4. young people, repeated authors, it is best to timely surgery, in order to avoid the aftermath.","pulmonary bullae are generally secondary to inflammatory lesions of the small bronchi, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis or emphysema, and there are also some idiopathic pulmonary bullae with unclear etiology.after inflammatory disease of the small bronchus, edema and stenosis occur, and the luminal part is blocked, which produces a flap function, so that air can enter the alveoli and is not easy to discharge, causing the pressure in the alveolar cavity to rise; at the same time, inflammation causes lung tissue damage, alveolar wall and space. gradually rupture due to increased intravesicular pressure, the alveoli fuse with each other to form a large balloon-containing cavity.under the microscope, the vesicle wall is a squamous epithelial cell of the alveoli, and sometimes only the fibrous membrane or fibrous connective tissue is present. there are single and multiple lung vesicles.secondary to pneumonia or tuberculosis are often single-shot; secondary to emphysema often occur multiple, and large bubbles often associated with aneurysm-like changes in lung tissue boundaries.emphysema with obvious pulmonary bullae is also called macrobubble emphysema.","['chest tightness', 'short breath', 'breathing difficulty', 'chest suffocation']",['spontaneous pneumothorax'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"

(1) epidemiology classical coronavirus infection mainly occurs in winter and spring, and is widely distributed throughout the world. the virus includes three groups. the first and second groups are mainly mammalian coronavirus, and the third group mainly includes avian coronavirus. human coronavirus has two blood stasis types (hco-229e, hcov-oc43), which is an important pathogen of human respiratory infection. 20% of human common cold is caused by coronavirus, and coronavirus is also important for acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in adults. one of the causes, genomics studies have shown that the sars-cov gene is different from the known three classical coronaviruses. the first group of virus sera can react with sars-cov, while the sars patients' serum cannot be known. coronavirus response, therefore, as a new coronavirus, sars-cov can be classified as the fourth group. (ii) morphological structure sars-cov belongs to the genus coronavirus of the coronavirus family. it is an enveloped virus with a diameter of 60-120 nm. the capsule has a petal-like or ciliated protrusion on the envelope, which is about 20 nm long or longer. the base is narrow and resembles a crown. similar to the classical coronavirus, the morphogenesis of the virus is long and complex. the mature virus is spherical, elliptical, and the mature and immature virions vary greatly in size and morphology. there are many odd forms, such as kidney shape, drumstick shape, horseshoe shape, bell shape, etc., which are easily confused with organelles. in size, the virus particles are reduced from the initial 400nm to the late mature stage of 60-120nm, in the patient's body. a variety of viral particles can also be seen in the anatomical specimen sections. (3) biological characteristics the virus proliferates in the cytoplasm, and the polymerase encoded by the rna gene utilizes cellular material for rna replication and protein synthesis, assembles into a new virus, and buds are secreted outside the cell. unlike the coronavirus previously discovered, vero-e6 or vero (green monkey) is used. the kidney cells are easy to isolate and culture the sars-cov. the virus grows well at 37 ～c. the cells can be infected within 24 hours after infection. the virus can be titrated with plaques. the culture titer of the early isolates is generally up to 1 G106pfu/ml or so, can be cultured on rd (human striated muscle tumor cells), mdck (dog kidney cells), 293 (human embryonic kidney cells), 2bs (human embryo lung cells) and other cell lines, but the titer is low. . the virus can survive for at least 10 days in the urine at room temperature of 24 ～ c, survive for more than 5 days in the sputum and feces of diarrhea patients, and survive for 15 days in the blood, in plastic, glass, mosaic, metal, cloth, copy a variety of objects such as paper can survive for 2-3 days. the virus is sensitive to temperature and has a decreased resistance with increasing temperature. it can survive for 4 days at 37 ～ c, 90 minutes at 56 ～ c, and 30 minutes at 75 ～ c to inactivate the virus. uv irradiation for 60 minutes can kill the virus. the virus is sensitive to organic solvents. the effect of the ether at 4 ～ c for 24 hours can completely inactivate the virus, 75% ethanol for 5 minutes can make the virus lose its vitality, and the chlorine-containing disinfectant can inactivate the virus for 5 minutes. (4) characteristics of molecular biology the viral genome is a single-stranded positive-stranded rna consisting of approximately 30,000 nucleotides, which is only about 60% homologous to the classical coronavirus, but the genome is organized similarly to other coronaviruses, with the genome from 5 to 3 :5'-polymerase-semn-3, with a methylated cap structure at the 5'-end, followed by a 72-nucleotide leader sequence, and approximately 2/3 of the genomic rna is the open journalist framework (orf) 1a/1b, encoding rna polymerase (rep), which directly translates from genomic rna to form a polyprotein precursor, which is further cleaved by the major protease 3clpro, which is responsible for transcription and replication of the virus. there are 4 human orfs downstream of rep, encoding s, respectively. e, m and n four structural proteins, which are translated from subgenomic mrna, subgenomic mrna is synthesized by a mechanism of discontinuous transcription, transcription is initiated by transcriptional regulatory sequence (trs), and the conserved sequence of the latter is aaacgaac, genome the 3 end has a polya tail. the viral envelope is a bilayer lipid membrane, and the outer membrane proteins include glycoprotein s, m and capsid e protein. m glycoprotein is different from other coronavirus glycoproteins, and only the short amino terminal domain is exposed to the viral envelope. outside, the long, curved spiral nucleocapsid structure consists of a single molecule of genomic rna, a multi-molecular basic n protein, and the carboxy terminus of the m protein. the s protein is responsible for cell adhesion, membrane fusion, and induction of neutralizing antibodies. the molecular mass is about 150,000-180,000, including the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain and the short carboxy terminal cytoplasmic domain. in the classical coronavirus, the e protein and the m protein may constitute the smallest assembly unit, and the e protein plays a role in the assembly of the virus. a key role, m protein plays an important role in the stability of the viral core. unlike other coronaviruses, between s and e (x1-274aa, x2-154aa) and m and n (x3-63aa, x4-122aa, x5-84aa) has a potential coding sequence for polypeptides with more than 50 amino acids, and there are potential coding sequences for polypeptides with less than 50 amino acids between m and n. homology search results indicate that these potential polypeptides are he did not protein sequence similarity. at present, domestic and foreign scientists have reported the genome-wide sequence of several sars-cov, and found that the degree of variation is not high, from singapore 4, canada 1, the united states 1 strain, hong kong 2 strains, beijing 4 strains and guangdong 1 strain a total of 129 mutations were found in 13 strains. according to its phylogenetic tree, the current epidemic strains can be divided into two genomes: one group includes four strains of beijing (bj01-bj04), and one strain of guangzhou (gz01). one strain (cuhk) measured by the chinese university of hong kong and other strains belong to another group. analysis of the variability of the virus may provide clues for tracking the source of the virus. (v) immunological characteristics in most cases, when sars-cov is infected, the human immune system can stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses and gradually control infection and eliminate viruses. there is much evidence that the human immune system is infected by sars-cov. it can stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses and gradually control infection and eliminate viruses. there is a lot of evidence that sars-cov can directly invade the immune system, leading to lymphocytes, leukopenia and pathological damage of peripheral lymphoid tissues in patients, and peripheral blood of most sars patients. the white blood cell count was normal or decreased, while cd3+, cd4+, cd8+, and t lymphocytes were significantly lower than normal. the more severe the disease, the more obvious the decrease of t lymphocyte count. after the recovery of sars patients, the number and function of t lymphocytes gradually returned to normal. sars-cov nucleic acid can be detected from the patient's nasopharyngeal extract 5 days after the onset of clinical symptoms, peaking around the 10th day, and then starting to decrease; 21 days, 47% of patients with nasopharyngeal extract is positive, 67% fecal specimens were positive, 21% of urine samples were positive, and n protein induced a strong immune response. therefore, it can be used for antibody detection. the detection of antibodies indicates that 1 week after the onset of the disease, igm begins to be produced in the patient for up to 3 months; igg starts to be produced around 7-10 days, then gradually increases, and the antibody is about 1 month old. the titer reached a peak and all positive, until the patient recovered 6 months after the high level of positive, sars is a new disease, the population is generally susceptible, epidemiological data show that sars-cov mainly causes dominant infection, there is still no evidence of subclinical infection. after the sars epidemic, there is no immune protection barrier in the population, and the population is still generally susceptible. detection of sars-vov-specific antibodies in patients' serum is helpful for clinical diagnosis. sars is a new infectious disease caused by sars-cov. the understanding of its pathogenesis is still unclear. some of the clues obtained are mainly from autopsy data of sars deaths, ultrastructural studies, and sars at the nucleic acid level. many aspects of cov detection and clinical data of patients with sars are still speculated and inevitably affected by treatment measures. sars-cov enters the human body through the respiratory tract and replicates in the mucosal epithelium of the respiratory tract, further causing viremia. the cells infected by the virus include tracheal bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, intestinal epithelial cells, renal distal ductal epithelium and lymphocytes, alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells can damage the integrity of the respiratory membrane blood gas barrier, accompanied by inflammatory hyperemia, causing massive exudation of serum and fibrinogen, exudation fibrinogen aggregates into cellulose, which in turn forms a transparent membrane with necrotic alveolar epithelial debris. the body's response to sars-cov infection can be manifested by macrophage and lymphocyte exudation in the interstitial lung. activated macrophages and lymphocytes release cytokines and free radicals, further increasing the permeability of alveolar capillaries. and induced fibroblast proliferation, damaged alveolar epithelial cells fall into the alveolar cavity can form desquamative alveolitis, and the alveolar cavity contains a large number of macrophages, proliferative shedding of alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages can form giant cells, in terms of giant cell phenotype, are mainly alveolar epithelial cell sources (ae1/ae3 positive), and a few are macrophage sources (cd68 positive). the formation of giant cells may be related to sars-cov infection, because in vitro experiments it is proved that sars-cov infection can fuse vero cells to form syncytial cells. the above changes in lungs are consistent with the change of exudation period of diffuse alveolar damage (dad). the proliferative phase of dad is followed by patients with severe or poor recovery. and fibroblasts, and produce type i and type iii collagen fibers, intestinal epithelial cells and kidney distal segmental epithelial cells are infected by sars-cov, on the one hand gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with clinical part, it also may have some significance in terms of transmission of the disease, due to decreased blood oxygen saturation caused by dad and diffuse lung changes, and endovascular intravascular coagulation caused by factors such as vascular endothelial cell injury, multiple organ failure often results in death of the patient. the peripheral blood lymphocytes of sars patients are reduced, especially the number of cd4+ cells is reduced, and there is evidence that sars-cov directly infects lymphocytes, which may be related to the cytotoxicity of sars-cov and the induction of apoptosis. the humoral immune response of patients with kjqdsars it seems normal, but sars-cov infection will affect the humoral immune response to varying degrees from the perspective of sars patients' recovery serum. sars-cov affects cellular and humoral immune responses in the development of sars. certainly, at least means that patients with cellular and humoral immune damage have a poor prognosis. the materials related to sars biopsy and autopsy are limited, so the understanding of pathological changes is still limited. based on current autopsy materials and a small amount of bronchial biopsy, sars mainly involves lung and immune organs such as spleen and lymph nodes, other organs such as heart and liver. kidney, adrenal gland, brain, etc. can also be seen with varying degrees of damage, lung: generally bulging, swelling, weight increase, in addition to secondary infection, the pleura is generally smooth, dark red or dark gray-brown, chest can be no or a small amount of effusion, the lung tissue section is mostly changed evenly, may involve the whole lung leaves, like the hepatic dysfunction of lobar pneumonia, color reddish brown or dark purple, secondary infection may have different sizes abscess formation, thrombus can be seen in the pulmonary blood vessels, partial cases of pulmonary infarction can occur in some cases, and hilar lymphadenopathy can be seen in some cases. light microscopy: the lesions of the lungs are usually milder, involving almost all the lungs, mainly due to changes in the temperature-induced alveolar damage. according to the different stages of the disease, the following manifestations can be made: the cases with a course of about 10 days are mainly pulmonary edema, fibers. exudation, formation of transparent membrane, accumulation of macrophage in the alveolar cavity and proliferation of type ii alveolar epithelial cells fall into the alveolar formation of desquamable pneumonia and focal pulmonary hemorrhage, which is not only visible in autopsy specimens, but also in the fiberoptic bronchoscopy lung biopsy material, there is also the same lesion change. the partially proliferating alveolar epithelium is fused to each other and is a combined multinucleated giant cell. the virus is visible in the cytoplasm of the proliferating alveolar epithelium and exuded monocytes. inclusion bodies, as the lesion progresses, the pathogenesis of alveolar exudate is often seen in cases with a disease duration of more than 3 weeks. the mechanization of the transparent membrane and the fibroblast proliferation of the alveolar septum are continuously fused, eventually forming alveoli. occlusion and atrophy, resulting in consolidation of the whole lung, only some cases have obvious fibrosis, leading to pulmonary fibrosis and even hardening, small blood vessels in the lung are often visiblefibrinous microthrombus, the above lesions can be very different in different patients, even in the same patient's lung can also be seen in different periods of the disease, some cases, especially long-term treatment of patients, often seen scattered lobular pneumonia and even a large area of fungal infection, of which aspergillus infection is the most common, secondary infection can involve the pleura, causing pleural effusion, pleural adhesions, and even pleural occlusion. lymph nodes (abdominal lymph nodes and hilar lymph nodes): in some cases, lymphadenopathy is seen. under the microscope, almost all lymph nodes in the lymph nodes have atrophy or disappearance. the lymphocyte distribution is sparse, the number is reduced, and the blood vessels and lymphatic sinuses are obvious. dilated and hyperemia, sinus tissue cells are obviously proliferating, and some diseases can show bleeding and necrosis.","['chilling', 'sustained fever', 'breathing difficulty', 'lack of strength']","['sepsis', 'digestive tract bleeding', 'diffuse intravascular

lung metastases,"a lung metastasis is a metastatic tumor that originates in other parts of the body and is transferred to the lungs via the blood or lymphatics.according to statistics, about 20 to 30% of cases of death from malignant tumors have lung metastases.the time of lung metastasis of malignant tumors varies from day to night. most cases are metastasized within 3 years after the onset of primary cancer. it is also more than 10 years old, but there are also a few cases where lung metastases are found earlier than the primary tumor. .the primary malignant tumors that metastasize to the lungs are mostly from the breast, bones, digestive tract and genitourinary system.most of the lung metastatic tumors are multiple lesions throughout the lungs, varying in size and density. there is no effective treatment for these advanced cancer cases.in a few cases, only a single isolated metastatic lesion in the lung may be considered for external surgery.pulmonary metastases must be differentiated from primary lung tumors. in addition to tumor distribution, pathological examination combined with immunohistochemistry plays an important role in differential diagnosis.","because lung metastases are metastasized from other parts of the body through bloodstream dissemination.therefore, prevention is mainly based on active treatment of primary tumors.pay attention to proper rest, do not master the combination of movement and rest, rest well, is conducive to the recovery of the body; exercise can enhance physical strength and enhance disease resistance, and the combination of the two can better recover.","pulmonary metastases are metastasis of malignant tumors in other parts of the body. the pathways can be hematogenous dissemination, lymphatic metastasis or direct invasion of adjacent organs, choriocarcinoma, breast cancer, malignant soft tissue tumors, liver cancer, osteosarcoma and pancreatic cancer is second; there are also thyroid cancer, kidney cancer, prostate cancer and kidney embryo cancer. pulmonary metastases are most common in hematogenous metastasis. the blood cells are transferred to the right heart of the tumor cells and transferred to the right lung. after the tumor plug reaches the pulmonary arterioles and capillaries, it can infiltrate and pass through the blood vessel wall. alveolar growth, the formation of lung metastases, lymphatic metastasis from the blood to the pulmonary arterioles and capillary bed, and then through the blood vessel wall into the perivascular lymph nodes, cancer cells proliferate in the lymphatic vessels, the formation of multiple small nodular lesions , often occurs in the perivascular interstitial, interlobular septum and subpleural interstitial, and spread in the lung through the lymphatic vessels, the primary disease of the tumor directly transferred to the lung into the pleura, chest wall and mediastinal malignant tumor, lung when the metastatic tumor is small, there are few symptoms, especially hematogenous metastasis. the blood in the cough and sputum is rare. a large number of lung metastases may have shortness of breath, especially lymphatic metastasis. faster, rapid aggravation within a few weeks, chest distention, chest pain or chest pain, lung metastatic tumors change quickly, tumors increase in the short term, increase, and someafter tumor resection or radiation therapy, chemotherapy, sometimes shrink or disappear.","['thirsty vomiting', 'difficulty breathing', 'stationary doctor']",['arrhythmia'],"['oncology', 'oncology']","['surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
pneumonia pseudotumor,"pneumonia pseudotumor is a benign mass in the lung. it is a non-specific inflammatory proliferative tumor-like lesion of the lung parenchyma. it is a granuloma, mechanization, fibrous connective tissue hyperplasia and related secondary lesion formation caused by chronic inflammation in the lung. the lumps are not real tumors.pneumonia pseudotumor is more common.pneumonia pseudotumor accounts for the first or second place in benign lung tumors.","the disease is related to bacteria and viral infections in the respiratory tract, and the irregular application of antibiotics limits the inflammatory lesions of the lungs, or delays absorption, so that the incidence increases, so proper exercise of the body has certain positive significance for preventing this disease. the other is to use antibiotics correctly.","the disease is associated with bacterial and viral infections in the respiratory tract. it is a localized non-specific proliferative neoplastic lesion after pulmonary infection. the pathological changes are mainly fibroblasts, various inflammatory cells, tissue cells and vascular components.irregular application of antibiotics localizes inflammatory lesions in the lungs, or delays absorption, resulting in increased morbidity. pathogenesis the pathological features of pneumococcal pseudotumor are histological pleomorphism. the mass of granulation tissue in the mass varies, and the fibroblasts, plasma cells, lymphocytes, tissue cells, epithelial cells, and inner cells are arranged in a line. foam cells or pseudo-yellow cell cells containing neutral fat and cholesterol, so many authors have different names and types based on the advantages of cell possession, such as pseudopapillary tumor type, fibroblastoma type, plasmacytoma type , pseudo-lymphoma type, pathogen and pathogenesis are still unclear. pneumonia pseudotumor is generally located in the lung parenchyma, only a small number of bronchial involvement, the vast majority of single hair, round or oval nodules, generally no complete capsule, but the mass is more limited, the boundary is clear, and some collagen fibrous connective tissue, which is thicker and lacks cells, is separated from the lung parenchyma.a small number of pneumococcal pseudotumions can develop cancer.","['chest pain', 'low fever', 'hemoptysis']",['hemoptysis'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
pulmonary cryptococcosis,"pulmonary cryptococcal disease (pulmonary cryptococcosis) is a subacute or chronic visceral fungal disease caused by a novel cryptococcal infection. this bacterium is a saprophytic yeast that does not form hyphae and spores and is widely found in nature.the low immune function of the body is the main cause of the disease. most of the bacteria are inhaled into the human body by the respiratory tract, forming an infection in the lung.it mainly invades the lungs and central nervous system, but it can also invade bones, skin, mucous membranes and other organs. after infection, healthy people can self-heal or the lesions are confined to the lungs without clinical symptoms.","1. the application of long-term antibiotics can cause imbalance of the body flora; the abuse of adrenocortical hormone can inhibit the body's immune response, which creates conditions for the infection and spread of cryptococcus. therefore, the use of the above drugs should be strictly eliminate abuse.for long-term use of antibiotics or adrenocortical hormones, if the condition does not improve or worsen, you should consider the possibility of cryptococcal infection, timely pathogen examination. 2. pay attention to health care, avoid eating decayed pears, peaches and other fruits to prevent the contamination of the environment by pigeon droppings and rat droppings. 3. should enhance the body's immunity, avoid wounds infected with soil and bird droppings.","low immune function is an important cause of cryptococcal disease. inhalation of cryptococci in normal people causes intrapulmonary infection. the lesions are mostly confined to the lungs, rarely appearing symptoms, and often have self-healing tendency. if patients with chronic diseases (such as advanced malignant tumors, leukemia, long-term exposure to large doses of hormones, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anticancer drugs) due to overwork or immunodeficiency, inhalation of fungi can form lesions in the lungs, which can be disseminated by blood. to the whole body, and more invading the central nervous system. the bacteria usually enter the body through the respiratory tract, and the lungs are the first site of infection.","['resident doctor', 'cryptococcus capsular polysaccharide accumulation', 'sputum is mucopurulent', 'breathing difficulty', 'low fever', 'fever with cough, slightly...']",['meningitis'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
lung cancer,"lung cancer occurs in the bronchial mucosa epithelium, also known as bronchial carcinoma.in the past 50 years, the incidence of lung cancer has been reported to increase significantly in many countries. among male cancer patients, lung cancer has ranked first, and the incidence rate in women has also increased rapidly, accounting for the second or third place of common malignant tumors in women.the etiology of lung cancer is still not fully clear. a large amount of data indicates that long-term large amount of cigarette smoking is an important cause of lung cancer.for more than 40 cigarettes per day for many years, the incidence of lung squamous cell carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma is 4 to 10 times higher than that of non-smokers.the incidence of lung cancer in urban residents is higher than in rural areas, which may be related to air pollution and carcinogens in smoke.therefore, it should promote non-smoking and strengthen urban environmental sanitation.","daily prevention of lung cancer 1, smoking cessation, smoking is one of the most important factors leading to lung cancer, active smoking and passive smoking will cause great harm to the body, so smoking cessation is the preferred method to prevent lung cancer. 2, develop correct eating habits, prevent lung cancer, regular diet, eat more fungi, beans, drink less. 3, adhere to the physical examination, each physical examination must do chest x-ray lateral examination, try to do chest x-ray examination every year, for detailed cases of suspected cases.adherence to physical examination can achieve early detection and early treatment. health education 1. prohibition and control of smoking bans and control of smoking must first focus on reducing the proportion of smokers in the population. it is necessary to enact certain laws or regulations to restrict people, especially to limit youth smoking. 2, control air pollution to do environmental protection work, effectively control air pollution, so as to achieve the purpose of preventing lung cancer. 3. occupational protection for mining areas where radioactive ore is to be mined, effective protective measures should be taken to minimize the amount of radiation received by workers. workers exposed to carcinogenic compounds must take various effective and effective labor protection measures to avoid or reduce contact with carcinogenic factors. 4, prevention and treatment of chronic bronchitis due to chronic bronchitis patients with lung cancer incidence rate is higher than no chronic bronchitis, so active prevention and treatment of chronic bronchitis has a certain significance in the prevention of lung cancer, especially to persuade smokers with chronic bronchitis to quit smoking, the incidence of lung cancer is higher in people who suffer from chronic bronchitis and smoking. 5, early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of early lung cancer screening methods are still unsatisfactory, the cost of screening lung cancer in the population is very expensive, and the possibility of reducing lung cancer mortality is very small. the study used chemoprevention, such as the use of cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitors, fat oxygenase inhibitors, etc. to try to block the development of carcinogenic factors, some foods rich in vitamin e, carotenoids, retinal, selenium and other foods for lung cancer it also has a preventive effect.","in 1922, hampeln found that continuous smoking and inhalation of dust can stimulate the bronchial epithelium to induce cancer. in 1924, moller used tar on the back of the rabbit and found that the incidence of lung cancer increased slightly. it is currently considered that smoking is the most basic risk factor for lung cancer. there are more than 3,000 kinds of chemicals in tobacco. multi-chain aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzopyrene) have strong carcinogenic activity and can act on some special enzymes in human tissues (especially lung tissues) to produce cells. mutations in molecular structures (such as dna) may have mutations in k-ras. it is estimated that up to 15% of lung cancer patients have a history of environmental and occupational exposure, and there is sufficient evidence to confirm that the following nine industrial ingredients increase the incidence of lung cancer: by-products of aluminum products, arsenic, asbestos, bis-chloromethyl ether, chromium compounds, coke ovens, mustard gas, nickel-containing impurities, vinyl chloride, long-term exposure to strontium, cadmium, silicon, formalin and other substances will also increase the incidence of lung cancer. in addition, air pollution, especially industrial waste gas, is a high risk factor for lung cancer. uranium and fluorspar miners are exposed to inert gas helium, decaying uranium by-products, etc., which are significantly higher than other people's lung cancer, but people with ionizing radiation do not increase lung cancer. in patients with tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, etc., the bronchial epithelium may become squamous in the process of chronic infection, eventually causing cancer, but such cases are rare. family, genetic and congenital factors as well as decreased immune function, metabolism, and endocrine dysfunction may also be risk factors for lung cancer. the incidence of lung cancer in industrialized countries is high, the city is higher than the rural areas, and the factory mining area is higher than the residential area. the main reason is that the industrial and transportation developed areas, oil, coal and internal combustion engines, and the asphalt roads contain dust and benzopyrene-induced carcinogenesis. hazardous substances such as hydrocarbons pollute the atmosphere. the survey materials indicate that the incidence of lung cancer is also high in areas with high concentrations of benzopyrene in the atmosphere. air pollution and the incidence of tobacco smoke on lung cancer may promote each other and play a synergistic role. the pathogenesis of lung cancer metastasis has the following four pathways: 1. direct diffusion the cancer grows, blocking the bronchial lumen, and also expanding into the extrapulmonary lung tissue. tumors near the periphery of the lung can invade the pleura and chest wall. central or near the mediastinum can invade the pleura and chest wall, central type or tumors close to the mediastinum can invade other organs, and large tumors can undergo central ischemic necrosis and form cancerous cavities. 2, blood transfer is a late manifestation of lung cancer, cancer cells with the pulmonary veins back to the left heart, can be transferred to any part of the body, the common transfer sites are liver, brain, lung, bone cool system, adrenal gland, kidney and pancreas. 3. in the caseof disseminatedalveolar cell carcinoma in the bronchus, cancer cells on the bronchioles and alveolar walls are easily detached; cancer cells can diffuse through the bronchial tubes into adjacent lung tissues to form new cancerous foci. 4, lymphatic metastasis of the lymphatic drainage of the lungs has a certain rule of the right upper lobe to the right hilar and right upper mediastinal lymph nodes, right middle lobe flow to the middle, lower lobe summary area lymph nodes, subcarinal and right upper mediastinal lymph nodes, right lower lobe middle, lower leaf summary area, subcarinal ligament, lower lung ligament and right upper mediastinal lymph node, left upper lobe lead to aortic arch (bottallo) lymph node, left anterior superior mediastinal lymph node, left lower lobe lymph flow up and down leaf summary area, long lymph nodes and lymph nodes metastasis (n-state) in the upper right mediastinal lymph nodes, such as lymph node lung cancer with marshoff, can be shown. histological classification of lung cancer: the main pathological types of lung cancer are divided into two categories: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.

cadmium poisoning,"cadmium poisoning: cadmium poisoning, cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide sulfonate is low toxicity, cadmium oxide, cadmium sulfate, cadmium chloride, cadmium nitrate and other moderate toxicity.poisoning is mainly caused by inhalation of cadmium soot or cadmium compound dust. a large inhalation can cause acute chemical pneumonia and pulmonary edema, severe cough, cough, and difficulty breathing. it can be recovered in about 2 weeks, and a few can be converted to chronic; chronic poisoning causes pulmonary fibrosis and kidney disease.the industries exposed to cadmium are smelting and spraying of cadmium, welding and casting bearing surfaces, cadmium rods of nuclear reactors or cadmium-coated graphite rods as neutron absorbers, cadmium storage batteries and other cadmium compounds, etc., japan reports ""pain"" it is a chronic cadmium poisoning caused by long-term feeding of water contaminated with cadmium sulfate.the maximum allowable concentration of oxidation barrier in the air of our workshop is 0.1mg/m3.","in order to prevent cadmium poisoning, use cadmium and its compounds in a place with good ventilation and containment.in addition to the necessary exhaust equipment, the welding and plating processes should be eaten and smoked.the maximum allowable concentration of cadmium oxide in the production sites in china is 0.1 mg/m3.cadmium-plated utensils cannot store food.","cadmium poisoning is mainly caused by inhalation of cadmium soot or cadmium compound dust. a large inhalation can cause acute pneumonia and pulmonary edema, and chronic poisoning causes pulmonary fibrosis and kidney disease. the industries exposed to cadmium are smelting and spraying of cadmium, welding and casting bearing surfaces, cadmium rods of nuclear reactors or cadmium-coated graphite rods as neutron absorbers, cadmium batteries and other cadmium compounds. japan reported that ""pain"" is a chronic cadmium poisoning caused by long-term feeding of water contaminated with cadmium sulfate. pathogenesis: cadmium oxide smoke is slowly absorbed in the respiratory tract, about 11% is retained in the lung tissue, cadmium compounds are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract by 5% to 7%, and the rest are excreted by the feces. the absorbed cadmium is mainly excreted by the kidneys, and the milk is also excretion, cadmium can pass through the placenta, affecting the fetus, the cadmium absorbed in the body, the discharge is very slow, only 50% in 10 years. when cadmium enters the blood, it rapidly combines with metallothionein (mt) to form cadmium metal prion protein (mtcd), about 70% in red blood cells, and 30% in plasma. according to the blood gel chromatogram analysis, there are three cadmium-containing peaks. mt-cd accounted for about 65%, high molecular protein bound cadmium (hmwp-cd) accounted for 30%, non-protein small molecule cadmium conjugate (lmw-cd) accounted for 5%; cadmium in red blood cells except the above three in addition, hemoglobin-bound cadmium (hb-cd) accounts for about 5%, of which hmwp-cd has a major toxic effect. cadmium in systemic tissues mainly passes through the blood circulation, and cadmium is released into the tissue from the plasma, mainly in the liver. in the kidney, the cadmium content in the liver decreases with time, while the cadmium content in the kidney increases gradually, accounting for about 1/3 of the total cadmium in the body. the toxic effect of cadmium on the tissue is through competition between cadmium and calcium and calmodulin (cam). combines, interferes with cam and its regulated physiological and biochemical systems, inhibits ca2+-atpase and phosphodiesterase activity, depolymerizes microtubules in cytoplasm and affects cytoskeleton, stimulates arterial vascular smooth muscle cells to cause elevated blood pressure, cadmium also stimulates catechol synthetase activity increased levels of dopamine, inhibition of na + -k + -atp enzyme, zinc-containing enzymes, amino acid decarboxylase, histidine, amylase, oxidase activity too. in particular, leucyl aminopeptidase is inhibited, and the protein is decomposed. the kidney is the main excretion organ of cadmium, and the cadmium is further retained. when the urinary cadmium is 2 米g/g creatinine, the urinary 6-keto-prostaglandin 1a (6-ketone) -pgf1a) and sialic acid levels have begun to increase significantly; 4 米g / g creatinine, renal tubular antigen bba, n-acetyl-汕-glucosaminidase (nag), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (iap), albumin and ferritin is elevated in urine; when it reaches 10 米g/g creatinine, serum 汕2 microglobulin (汕2mg) and urinary 汕2mg, th-glycoprotein (thg) and glycosaminoglycan (gag) are elevated. the above indicators reflect cadmium-induced renal biochemical changes, glomerular barrier function damage, tubular cell damage and dysfunction, cadmium also causes liver cell damage, causing abnormal liver function; hindering intestinal absorption of iron, induced hypopigmentation anemia, cadmium inhibits 汐1-antitrypsin (汐1trypsin) caused by cadmium-induced emphysema (cd-induced emphysema), cadmium has primary damage to blood vessels, causing tissue hypoxia and damage.","['cough with weight loss', 'breathing difficulty', 'finger, toenail showing cel...', 'diarrhea', 'lung texture thickening', 'weakness', 'fever with cold war', 'disgusting', ' indigestion', 'cough with difficulty breathing']",['edema'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
cold,"the common cold is divided into the common cold and influenza, and the common cold is discussed here first.the common cold, the motherland medicine called ""cold"", is a common respiratory disease caused by a variety of viruses, 30% -50% of which is caused by a certain type of serotype of rhinovirus, although the common cold is mostly in the early winter, but any season for example, spring and summer can occur, and the virus of the cold in different seasons is not exactly the same.influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza virus.the virus is present in the patient's respiratory tract and is transmitted to others by droplets when the patient coughs and sneezes.the flu is very contagious. because the virus is easily mutated, even people who have had the flu will still become infected when they encounter the flu epidemic next time. therefore, the flu is likely to cause an outbreak.generally, there are many opportunities to be popular in winter and spring, and 20 to 40% of people may get the flu every time.","the disease can occur throughout the year, often in winter and spring, and can be spread by virus-containing droplets or contaminated utensils. most of them are sporadic, but they are often prevalent in climate change. because of the type of virus, the human body the immunity produced by the virus infection is weak and short-lived, there is no cross-immunization, and there are virus carriers in healthy people, so one person may have multiple diseases within one year. daily prevention of four simple ways to prevent colds 1. cold water wash, hot water soaking method: daily morning and evening to develop the habit of using cold water bath surface, hot water soaking feet, which helps to improve the body's disease resistance. 2, salt water gargle: daily morning and evening, after meals, gargle with light salt water to remove oral bacteria. popular in the flu. 3, vinegar fumigation method: heating vinegar, close the doors and windows, fumigation in the room once in a while, can effectively kill viruses such as colds. 4, drinking ginger tea method: before going to bed at night, use radish and vinegar soup, or ginger, brown sugar, boil water for tea, have a good effect on preventing colds. professional guidance 1, supplement vitamin e, vitamin c. vitamin e and vitamin c can effectively improve human immunity. 2, to ensure adequate sleep. the data shows that people who sleep only half a night will have about 30% less immunity. after 8 hours of sleep, the immunity will recover immediately. 3. perform a nasal massage. in most colds, the nasopharynx is the site of the initial infection, so nasal massage can prevent colds.","70%-80% of colds are caused by viruses, mainly influenza viruses (a, b, c), parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, echovirus, coxsackie virus, measles virus, rubella virus. bacterial infection can occur directly or after viral infection, hemolytic streptococcus is more common, followed by haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci and staphylococcus, occasionally gram-negative bacilli, the main manifestations of infection are rhinitis, throat inflammation or tonsillitis is sore and so on. when there are induced factors such as cold, rain, excessive fatigue, etc., when the systemic or respiratory local defense function is reduced, the virus or bacteria that have existed in the upper respiratory tract or invaded from the outside can rapidly multiply, causing the disease, especially the weak young and old. or have chronic respiratory diseases such as paranasal sinusitis, tonsillitis, more susceptible to rickets.nasal and pharyngeal mucosa congestion, edema, destruction of epithelial cells, a small amount of mononuclear cell infiltration, serous and mucinous inflammatory exudation, secondary bacterial infection, neutrophil infiltration, a large number of purulent secretions.","['headaches', 'hot and cold', 'sore pain', 'fever', 'throat and burning sensation', 'runny nose', 'nasal', 'fever with cold war', 'emotional flu' ]",['bronchitis'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['symptom treatment', 'chinese medicine treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
infectious shock,"septic shock, also known as septic shock, refers to septic shock caused by metabolites such as microorganisms and their toxins. microorganisms and their toxins and cell wall products in infected areas invade the blood circulation and activate the host. cell and body fluid systems; produce inflammatory mediators that act on various organs and systems of the body, affecting their perfusion, leading to tissue ischemia and hypoxia, metabolic disorders, dysfunction, and even multiple organ failure.therefore, septic shock is the result of the interaction between microbial factors and the body's defense mechanism. the amount of virulence of the microorganisms and the internal environment and response of the organism are important factors in determining the occurrence and development of septic shock. gram-negative bacterial infections often cause infection. sexual shock.","1. actively prevent infections and various diseases that are likely to cause septic shock, such as sepsis, bacterial dysentery, pneumonia, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, peritonitis, etc. 2, do a good job of on-site treatment of trauma, such as timely hemostasis, analgesia, heat preservation and so on. 3, patients with blood loss or excessive fluid loss (such as vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, a lot of sweating, etc.) should promptly replenish or transfuse blood.","common pathogens of septic shock are gram-negative bacteria, such as enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, etc.); non-fermented bacilli (pseudomonas, acinetobacter, etc.); meningococcal; bacilli, etc., gram-positive bacteria, such as grape ball, streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, clostridium, etc. can also cause shock, certain viral diseases, such as epidemic hemorrhagic fever, susceptible to shock, some infections, such as gram-negative bacterial sepsis, fulminant meningitis, pneumonia, suppurative cholangitis, abdominal infection, bacillary dysentery (children) are easy to have shock. original chronic basic diseases such as cirrhosis, diabetes, malignant tumors, leukemia, burns, organ transplantation and long-term acceptance of immunosuppressive drugs such as adrenal cortex hormones, antimetabolites, bacterial toxic drugs and radiation therapy, or application of indwelling catheters or venous catheter can induce septic shock, so this disease is more common in hospital infected patients, the elderly, infants, childbirth women, poor physical recovery after major surgery is particularly likely to occur. special types of septic shock toxic shock syndrome (tss) tss is a serious syndrome caused by bacterial toxins. the initial reported tss is caused by staphylococcus aureus. in recent years, similar signs have been found to be caused by streptococcus. cause. 1. staphylococcus aureus tss is caused by exotoxin produced by non-invasive staphylococcus aureus. the first case was reported in 1978. in the early years, it was more common in menstruating women who used vaginal plugs. there were obvious regional distributions, mainly in the united states, followed by canada. in some countries in australia and europe, with the improvement of vaginal plugs, the incidence of s. aureus tss has decreased significantly after the use of high-absorbency vaginal plugs; the growth of non-menstrual tss, the skin and subcutaneous tissue, wounds most of the infections, followed by upper respiratory tract infections, no gender, ethnicity and regional characteristics, almost all cases in china are non-menstrual tss, from the patient's vagina, cervical local lesions can be isolated from staphylococcus aureus, but blood culture negative, pyrogenogenic exotoxin c (pec) and enterotoxin f (sef) isolated from this non-invasive s. aureus, collectively referred to as toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tsst-1), is considered to be associated with tss related to the disease, injection of purified tsst-1 into animals can cause symptoms similar to human tss. the main clinical manifestations of tss are acute high fever, headache, confusion, scarlet fever rash, skin desquamation after 1 to 2 weeks (foot) especially), very low blood pressure or erect syncope, often multiple system involvement, including: gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain); muscle (myalgia, increased blood cpk); mucosa (conjunctiva, pharynx, vagina) congestion; central nervous system system (headache, dizziness, disorientation, change of mind, etc.); liver (jaundice, increased alt and ast values, etc.); kidney (olidour or no urine, proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, etc.); heart (can heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis and atrioventricular block, etc.; blood (platelet reduction, etc.), menstrual tss patients often have vaginal discharge, cervical congestion, erosion, attachment may have tenderness, about 3% recurrence. 2. streptococcus tss (stss), also known as streptococcal tss-like syndrome (tsls). since 1983, north american and european groups have reported group a streptococci-induced toxic shock syndrome (stss), mainly causing disease. the substance is pyrogenic exotoxin a (spea), spea as a superantigen (sag) stimulates monocytes to produce tumor necrosis factor (tnf-汐) interleukin (il-1), and directly inhibits the myocardium, causing capillaries leakage caused shock, in the autumn of 1990 to the spring of 1991, some areas of the yangtze river delta (haian, wuxi, etc.) found scarlet fever-like disease outbreaks, rare in recent decades, rapid onset, chills, fever, headache sore throat (40%), pharyngeal congestion, vomiting (60%), diarrhea (30%), fever, scarlet fever-like rash on the second day, recovery period desquamation, peeling, severe symptoms of systemic poisoning, nearly half of them have different degrees low blood pressure, even coma, a small number of multiple organ dysfunction, from most patients throat swab culture to isolate the more virulent streptococcus mitis (streptococcus mitis), in some cases, the same pathogenic bacteria were detected in the blood, but b-type hemolytic streptococcus injecting the corresponding antibody from the serum of the recovery period, and injecting the isolated strain into the skin of rabbit or guinea pig can cause local swelling and suppurative damage, accompanied by elevated body temperature, and timely antibacterial (using penicillin, erythromycin or clindamycin) acupuncture) and antibody shock treatment, most patients recover. pathogenesis the pathogenesis of septic shock is extremely complicated. the microcirculatory disorder theory proposed in the 1960s laid the foundation for the pathogenesis of shock. the current research has reached the cellular and molecular levels, microbes and their toxins and cell wall components ( such as lipopolysaccharide, lps, etc.) activate various body responsive cells (including mononuclear-macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells, etc.) and body fluid systems (such as complement, kinin, coagulation and fibrinolysis systems) various endogenous mediators, cytokines, etc. play an important role in the pathogenesis. infectious shock is a combined result of multiple factors interacting with each other and causing each other. (1) the occurrence and development of microcirculatory dysfunction: during the development of shock, the changes of microvessel volume can undergo various stages of sputum, dilation and paralysis, that is, changes in microcirculation include ischemic oxygen phase, vascular vascular phase and three stages of diffuse intravascular coagulation (dic): 1. ischemic and hypoxic period: the characteristics of microcirculation changes in this period are: except for the heart, extracerebral vascular, skin and viscera (especially abdominal viscera) microvascular contraction, microcirculation perfusion is reduced, capillary network ischemic and hypoxic, among which the hydrostatic pressure is reduced, the interstitial fluid enters the microcirculation through the capillaries, and the capillary network is partially filled (self infusion). the mechanism involved in this microcirculation change is mainly the catecholamine, renin released by the sympathetic-adrenal medulla system. - angiotensin system, vasoactive lipids (bioactive substances produced by phospholipase a2, such as platelet activating factor, paf; and arachidonic acid metabolites such as carotenoid a2, axa2 and white three) alkene, leucotreine, lt), etc. 2. congestion and anoxic period: this is characterized by an increase in anaerobic metabolites (lactic acid), increased formation of histamine and bradykinin by mast cells, relaxation of micro-arteries and anterior sphincters of capillaries, and continuous contraction of venules, adherence of leukocytes adhesion, impaction, blood stasis in the microcirculation, increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, increased capillary permeability, extravasation of blood plasma, concentration of blood, reduction of effective circulating blood volume, further reduction of blood flow to the heart, and significant decrease in blood pressure hypoxia and acidosis are more obvious, and the generation of oxygen free radicals increases, causing extensive cell damage. 3, microcirculation failure period: blood concentration, blood cell aggregation, blood viscosity increased, and due to vascular endothelial damage and other causes of clotting system activation caused by dic, microvascular bed blockage, perfusion more reduced, and bleeding, etc., resulting in more organ failure causes shock to be difficult to reverse. according to the change of blood flow, the septic shock can be divided into high dynamic type (high row and low resistance type) and low dynamic type (low row high resistance type). if the former is not corrected in time, it will eventually develop into low power type and high. the occurrence of kinetic shock may be related to the release of histamine and bradykinin; the short circuit of arteriovenous vein is open, which constitutes a non-nutritive blood flow channel of microcirculation, and the blood passes through the short circuit to return the heart, and the output of the heart can be normal or even increased. the visceral microcirculation vegetative blood perfusion is reduced; endotoxin activates histidine dehydrogenase, accelerates the formation of histamine, and increases the release of histamine from mast cells; plus the direct damage of endotoxin to the vascular smooth muscle membrane leads to the membrane the ability to function normally to reduce calcium ions is associated with decreased vascular tone, and the occurrence of low-power shock is associated with alpha receptor excitation. (b) the cellular mechanism of shock: microcirculatory disorders are important in the occurrence of shock, but cell damage can occur before hemodynamic changes, that is, the metabolic disorder of the cells can be primary, possibly directly by endotoxin caused by the earliest occurrence of membrane dysfunction, membrane damage caused by the failure of na+-k+-atpase on the membrane, resulting in increased intracellular na+, decreased k+, edema in the cells, mitochondria is the first organelle to change when shocked, when after it is damaged, it can cause the following changes: 1 its respiratory chain function is disordered, causing metabolic disorder; 2 its oxidative phosphorylation function is reduced, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is not working properly, atp production is reduced, lactic acid is accumulated; the ion pump has obstacles, the intracellular and extracellular na+, k+, ca++, mg++ plasma concentration difference transfer, k+ and ca++ are lost from mitochondria, the intracytoplasmic ca++ is increased, and the phospholipase a2 on the membrane is activated to decompose the membrane phospholipid, resulting in membrane injury, its permeability increases, na+ and water enter the mitochondria, causing it to swell, structural damage, lysosome contains a variety of enzymes, which is the main digestive system in the cell, lysosome during shock permeability, plasmin release, resulting in cell death autolysis. in addition to activation of the body fluid system, endotoxin can also directly act on various reactive cells to produce cytokines and metabolites: 1. endothelial cells: cause cytotoxic reactions (no). 2, neutrophils: make it chemotactic aggregation, conditioning and phagocytosis; synthesis of paf, txa2, prostaglandin (pge), ltb4, etc.; release oxygen free radicals, lysosomal enzymes, elastase and so on. 3. platelets: aggregation, synthesis of txa2, etc. 4. mononuclear macrophages: release of tumor necrosis factor (tnf), interleukin-1 (il-1), lysosomal enzyme, plasminogen activin and the like. 5, basophils and mast cells: release of histamine, paf, lt and so on. 6, pituitary and hypothalamus: release acth, 汕-endorphin and thyroid stimulating hormone releasing hormone (trh). the importance of tnf in shock has been widely recognized, and tnf can bind to specific receptors of various cells in the body, producing a variety of physiological effects. tnf and il-1, il-6, ifn-污, paf and other cytokines have synergistic effects, which are important in vascular endothelial cell injury, while transforming growth factor (tgf-汕1) can alleviate the effects of tnf and other factors. tnf can activate neutrophils and lymphocytes, increase the expression of adhesion proteins on the membrane, enhance the adhesion between leukocytes and endothelial cells, and enhance the expression of adhesion proteins on the inner leukocyte membrane, resulting in endothelial cells. increased damage and permeability, promote blood coagulation, etc. animal experiments have shown that infusion of large doses of tnf can produce hemodynamics, blood biochemical and pathological changes that mimic septic shock, causing animals to die rapidly. (3) metabolic changes during shock, electrolyte and acid-base balance disorders: under shock stress, glycogen and fat catabolism are hyperactive, initial blood sugar, fatty acids and triglycerides are increased; glycogen depletion with shock, blood sugar is reduced, insulin secretion is reduced, glucagon is secreted, and early shock respiratory augmentation due to direct stimulation of bacterial toxins to the respiratory center or reflex stimulation of effective circulating blood volume, excessive ventilation, resulting in respiratory alkalosis; followed by insufficient oxygenation of the organ oxygenation, biooxidation occurs obstacles, tricarboxylic acid cycle inhibition, atp production decreased, lactic acid formation increased, leading to metabolic acidosis, deep and rapid breathing; late shock, often due to central nervous system or lung function damage caused by mixed acidosis, may occur changes in respiratory rhythm or amplitude, insufficient atp production every time the sodium pump on the membrane fails, resulting in abnormal distribution of ions inside and outside the cell: na+ influx brings water, causing cell edema, mitochondria swelling, matrix changes; k+ flows out of the cell the concentration of ca++ inside and outside the cell is thousands of times. this concentration difference depends on the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane to ca++ and the external pump. maintenance, calcium influx occurs when the membrane is damaged, and intracellular ca++ overload can produce a lot of harmful effects, such as activation of phospholipase a2, hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to produce arachidonic acid, the latter via cyclooxygenase and the lipid oxidase metabolic pathway produces prostaglandins (pgf汐, pge2, pgd2), prostacyclin (pgi2), txa2 and lt (ltb4, ltc4, ltd4, lte4) and other inflammatory mediators. these products can affect vascular tone and microvascular permeability. sexuality, and acts on platelets and neutrophils, causing a series of pathophysiological changes that play an important role in the development of shock. (4) changes in the function and structure of important organs during shock: 1. kidney: renal vascular smooth muscle av is short-circuited, renal cortical vasospasm during shock, and near-medullary microcirculation short circuit is open, causing cortical blood flow to decrease the blood flow is relatively guaranteed. if the shock persists, the renal tubules are necrotic due to ischemia and hypoxia, interstitial edema, and complicated with acute renal failure. when dic is present, the glomerular capillary plexus is extensively thrombosis. causes necrosis of the kidney cortex. 2. lung: the changes of pulmonary circulation during shock are mainly pulmonary microvascular contraction, increased resistance, large number of av short circuits, insufficient pulmonary capillary perfusion, and pulmonary blood flow into the pulmonary vein without alveolar gas exchange, resulting in imbalance of ventilation and perfusion ratio and oxygen diffusion function. obstruction, po2 decline, and systemic hypoxia, this condition is called adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards), neutrophils are considered to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of ards, complement activation product c5a attracts neutrophil accumulation the lungs circulate and adhere to the surface of the pulmonary capillary endothelium, releasing a variety of injurious mediators such as proteolytic enzymes, elastase, collagenase, arachidonic acid metabolites (prostaglandins, txa2, lt, etc.), oxygen self groups, etc. injury of lung parenchymal cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, etc., increased alveolar capillary permeability, plasma extravasation and interstitial edema, tnf, il-1 cytokine release also leads to neutrophil chemotaxis and the lung is stagnant and increases its adhesion to endothelial cells. in the case of ischemia and hypoxia, the secretion of alveolar surfactant is reduced, and lung compliance is reduced. it is easy to cause atelectasis, and can also cause swelling of alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium, aggravating the imbalance between alveolar ventilation and perfusion. in the shock, plasma fibronectin (fn) is often reduced by synthesis, accelerated degradation and increased consumption. can cause alveolar capillary membrane structural defects, as well as bacteria, toxins, fibrin degradation products difficult to remove, is also conducive to the production of ards. 3, heart: high oxygen consumption of the heart, coronary vascular perfusion has a great influence on myocardial function, arterial pressure is significantly reduced, when the diastolic blood pressure drops below 5.3 kpa (40 mm), the coronary perfusion is greatly reduced, myocardial ischemia and hypoxia subcellular structure changes significantly, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-reducing ability is weakened, na+-k+-atpase and adenylate cyclase activity on sarcolemma are decreased, metabolic disorder, acidosis, hyperkalemia, etc. can affect myocardial function, myocardial inhibitory factor and 汕-endorphin from the pituitary gland have inhibitory effects on the cardiovascular system. oxygen free radicals produced during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion can also cause myocardial inhibition and injury, although the heart beat during shock it can be normal, but the ventricular function is abnormal, which is reflected in the decrease of cardiac ejection fraction, ventricular dilatation, myocardial fiber degeneration, necrosis and rupture, interstitial edema, and dic, microthrombus formation in myocardial blood vessels. 4. liver: the liver is supplied by double blood. the smooth muscle of the portal system is very sensitive to catecholamine. in addition, the gradient of blood flow pressure difference in the portal system is small, and the flow rate is relatively slow. therefore, the liver is prone to ischemia and ischemia, blood stasis and dic. the liver is the body's metabolism, detoxification and synthesizing organs such as blood coagulation factors and fibrinolysis. hepatic function is impaired after persistent hypoxia, which may cause systemic metabolic disorders and lactate accumulation, weakened barrier function and dic formation, often making shock difficult. treatment, hepatocyte degeneration, necrosis in the central region of the hepatic lobules, microthrombus formation in the central vein. 5, the brain: brain tissue oxygen demand is high, its glycogen content is very low, mainly relying on blood flow supply, when the blood pressure drops below 7.9kpa (60mmhg), the brain irrigation flow is insufficient, when the brain is hypoxia, the star the shape cells first swell and compress the blood vessels, and the vascular endothelial cells also swell, causing microcirculatory disorders and abnormal blood flow, which aggravate cerebral hypoxia. after the atp storage is exhausted, the sodium pump disappears and causes brain edema, such as short-term it is impossible to restore the cerebral circulation, and it is difficult to reverse the development of cerebral edema. 6, other: intestinal sympathetic nerve is rich in distribution, blood circulation is reduced in shock, intestinal mucosal ischemia, injury, followed by edema, hemorrhage, bacterial invasion, endotoxin into the blood circulation to increase shock, in addition to histidine decarboxylase activation release histamine, resulting in abdominal visceral and portal vascular bed congestion, plasma leakage and exacerbation of shock, severe ischemia and hypoxia, pancreatic lysosomes release proteolytic enzymes and cause serious consequences.","['cryogenic

anaphylactic shock,"anaphylactic shock is caused by a general allergen that is harmless to the human body and acts on allergic patients. the systemic rapid allergic reaction mainly caused by acute peripheral circulatory hypoperfusion is due to the release of the immediate antigen-antibody reaction. vasomotor dysfunction caused by histamine, serotonin and other vasoactive substances, increased permeability of blood vessel wall, extravasation of blood plasma, sudden decrease in blood volume, shock caused by insufficient tissue perfusion, and often accompanied by laryngeal edema and tracheal fistula , pulmonary edema and so on.mainly manifested as itchy skin, urticaria, dyspnea, chest tightness, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, pale, and severely into the state of shock.if you do not rescue in time, you can often die within 5-10 minutes.","prevention of the most fundamental methods to clear the allergens of this disease, and effective prevention and prevention, but it is often difficult to make specific allergen diagnosis in clinical, and many patients belong to allergic reactions that are not caused by immune mechanisms, to this end, you should pay attention to: 1. consult the history of allergies before using the medicine. positive patients should make a striking and detailed record on the front page of the medical history. 2, try to reduce the need to take medicine, try to use oral preparations. 3, for patients with allergies after the injection of drugs for 15 to 20 minutes, before you must receive the drug that induces the disease (such as sulfonate contrast agent), it is best to use antihistamines or prednisone 20 ~ 30mg. 4, the first skin test in the skin test, try not to have a positive drug, if it must be used, you can try the ""desensitization test"" or ""desensitization test"", the principle is that under the protection of antihistamines and other drugs, the patient gradually increases the amount of the desensitized drug from a very small dose until the patient develops tolerance. during the desensitization process, there must be close observation by the medical staff, and the aqueous adrenaline, oxygen, endotracheal intubation and preparation are prepared. all emergency rescue measures such as intravenous corticosteroids.","endothelin (insulin, vasopressin), enzyme (chymotrypsin, penicillinase), pollen infusion (porcine grass, tree, grass), food (egg, milk, hard fruit, seafood, chocolate), antiserum ( anti-lymphocyte serum or anti-lymphocyte gamma globulin), occupational exposure to proteins (rubber products), bee toxins. examples include antibiotics (penicillin, cephalosporin, amphotericin b, nitropyrazine), local anesthetics (procaine, lidocaine), vitamins (thiamine, folic acid), diagnostic preparations (iodine) x-ray contrast agent, iodonium bromide), occupational exposure to chemicals (ethylene oxide). the vast majority of anaphylactic shock is a typical type i allergy in the body of multiple organs, especially the performance of the circulatory system, the external antigenic substance (some drugs are not whole antigen, but after entering the human body, combined with protein into a whole antigen) the body can stimulate the immune system to produce corresponding antibodies, in which the yield of ige varies greatly depending on the constitution. these specific iges have strong pro-cell properties and can be associated with ""target cells"" such as skin, bronchi, and blood vessel walls. binding, when the same antigen is again contacted with the sensitized individual, it can trigger a wide range of allergic type i allergic reactions, and various histamine, platelet activating factor, etc. released during the process cause multiple organ edema, exudation the direct cause of clinical manifestations. in the process of blood transfusion, plasma or immunoglobulin, immediate anaphylactic shock can also be seen, and their causes are three: 1 the specific ige of the donor is reacted with the drug being treated by the recipient (such as penicillin g). 2) selective iga deficiency can produce anti-iga igg antibody after multiple infusions containing iga blood products. when iga-containing products are re-injected, iga-anti-iga antibody immune complex may occur, type iii occurs. allergic shock caused by allergic reaction; 3 gamma globulin (gamma sphere) preparation for intravenous infusion contains high molecular weight propylene globule polymer, which can activate complement and produce anaphylatoxins such as c3a, c4a, c5a; cells that produce anaphylactic shock, a small number of patients after the application of drugs such as opium sputum, dextran, high-eluting x-ray contrast agents or antibiotics (such as polymyxin b), mainly through the degranulation of mast cells, will also the clinical manifestations of anaphylactic shock, late, people will not react with allergens and antibodies, that is, the symptoms and signs of anaphylactic shock caused by non-immune mechanisms are called allergic reactions (anaphylactoid reaction). pathological changes the main pathological manifestations of sudden death due to this disease are: acute pulmonary blood stasis and hyperinflation, laryngeal edema, visceral congestion, pulmonary interstitial edema and hemorrhage, microscopic edema of airway submucosa, increased secretion of small airways, bronchial and pulmonary interstitial vascular congestion with eosinophil infiltration, about 80% of death cases with myocardial focal necrosis or lesions, spleen, liver and mesenteric vessels are also hyperemia with eosinophil infiltration, a few cases can also there are gastrointestinal bleeding and so on.","['lip pale', 'syncope', 'confusion of consciousness', 'wind group', 'consciousness disorder', 'heart panic', 'hypotension']",['edema'],['emergency department'],"['once happens, rescue on the spot']"
goodpasture syndrome,"goodpasture syndrome, also known as anti-base glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhagic-nephritis syndrome or goodpasture disease, may be caused by viral infection and/or inhalation of certain chemical substances.it is a serious damage of the glomerular and alveolar wall basement membrane caused by anti-base membrane antibody, clinical manifestations of pulmonary hemorrhage, rapid glomerulonephritis and serum anti-glomerular basement membrane (gbm) antibody-positive triad.most patients progress rapidly and the prognosis is dangerous.","daily prevention of goodpasture syndrome 1. personal hygiene: kindergarten teachers actively cultivate children's good personal hygiene habits, wash hands carefully before and after eating, cut nails frequently, and correct bad habits of sucking fingers in time to eliminate the chance of egg entry. 2. dietary hygiene: all faculty and staff in kindergartens wash their hands with soap and running water before work, and disinfect them with 1:1000 disinfectant; ensure that children do not drink raw water, and wash and peel when eating raw fruits. 3. environmental hygiene: cultivate good urination habits for young children. toilets should be used exclusively for young children. afterwards, they should be washed and kept clean and odorless at least once a day.","the exact cause is unclear and may be the result of a combination of multiple causes. it is generally thought to be related to the following factors: respiratory infections, especially with influenza virus infection, are the most common cause of this disease. recent studies have found that patients with acquired immunodeficiency disease are infected with kapos. after pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the body is prone to produce anti-gbm antibodies. calderon et al reported that 3 of 4 hiv-infected patients were positive for anti-type iv collagen 汐3 chain antibody (anti-gbm antibody), suggesting pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. alveolar damage can induce pulmonary hemorrhagic-nephritis syndrome. contact with gasoline vapors, hydroxylates, turpentine and inhalation of various hydrocarbons. inhalation of these substances may cause goodpasture syndrome, and more attention needs to be paid to preventive measures. perez et al reported that a patient with long-term smoking developed pulmonary hemorrhagic-nephritis syndrome after 3 weeks of cocaine use. pathogenesis due to certain causes, the body simultaneously produces anti-alveolar, glomerular basement membrane antibodies, and thus attack the glomerulus and lung, type ii allergic reaction, as well as immune complexes to alveolar and glomerulus there is no definitive explanation for the pathogenesis of deposition and activation of complement (type iii allergy). in 1962, steblay et al. confirmed that glomerular basement membrane (gbm) damage in pulmonary hemorrhagic-nephritis syndrome was mediated by anti-gbm antibodies, and a large amount of research work focused on the isolation and study of gbm components in search of antibodies. the corresponding antigen and the molecular structure and characteristics of the antigen. in recent years, with the rapid development of molecular biology and biochemistry, the nc1 domain of the 汐3(iv) chain was confirmed in the newly discovered 汐3(iv) chain of collagen iv. it is goodpasture's own antigen, also known as goodpasture antigen, and then cloned the antigen gene co14a3, which is located in the q35-37 region of the second chromosome. indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that goodpasture antigen is not only found in gbm, but also in renal tubular basement membrane (tbm), alveolar capillary basement membrane (abm) and other tissue basement membranes (such as choroid, cornea, crystal, retinal blood vessels). the basement membrane and so on, but the pathogenic goodpasture antigen is mainly distributed in gbm, tbm and abm. the occultity of the antigen causes the reversibility of the exposure process. the 汐3nc1 structure can be exposed in vitro by 6 mol of guanidine hydrochloride or a strong acid condition of ph 3. domain, but how the body antigen is exposed and produces an immune response damage gbm is not fully understood, it is speculated that under physiological conditions goodpasture antigen is concealed in the collagen iv汐3nc1 domain, various predisposing factors (toxins, viral infections, bacterial infections, tumors, immune genetic factors and endotoxin can activate epithelial, endothelial and mesangial cell proliferation, and release inflammatory mediators (il-1, rds, prostaglandins, neutral proteases, etc.), gbm, etc. under the action of cellular enzymes, collagen iv high-level structure dissociation, exposure of goodpasture antigenic determinants, stimulation of the body to produce antibodies, resulting in immune damage, due to the whole body hair in the vascular endothelium, only the endothelial layer of the glomerular capillaries has a window, so that the antibody can be directly contacted with the gbm antigen and cause disease, while the abm is only subject to certain external factors (such as infection, smoking, inhalation of gasoline or organic solvents). after the effect, the integrity of the basement membrane antigen is exposed to the lungs after exposure, which is why the kidney is most susceptible and the degree of involvement is consistent with the antibody titer, and the degree of involvement of the lung is inconsistent with the antibody titer. the frequency of hla-dr2 and other antigens in patients with this disease was significantly increased (up to 89%, only 32% in normal controls). the use of gene dna restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis also showed that the disease and hla-dr4, hla-dq汕 chain gene dqwlb and dqw3 related, indicating that hla class ii antigen-associated lymphocytes play a role in this disease. some experiments have found that if only anti-gbm antibodies are given to the test animals, gbm can form a line-like deposition, but it does not occur, and only enter the diseased animals at the same time. after t cells, the test animals only developed disease, which confirmed that t cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. recent studies have also found that certain cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and il-1 can aggravate the development of this disease.","['lung bleeding', 'blood urinary', 'dyspnea', 'kidney failure', 'hemoptysis', 'qi short', 'no urine', 'fever with cough, slightly...', 'less urine',

mercury poisoning,"mercury is a white liquid metal, which is easy to evaporate at room temperature. mercury poisoning is more common in chronics. it mainly occurs in production activities. it mainly enters the human body through the respiratory tract in the form of steam. the absorption of mercury in the gastrointestinal tract is not very high. poisoned.mercury poisoning is characterized by mental-neuronal abnormalities, gingivitis, and tremor. the patients are often characterized by dizziness, forgetfulness, palpitations, hyperhidrosis, emotional excitement, obvious tremors of the fingers and the eyelids, metallic taste in the mouth, ulcers, swelling of the gums and even there are blue black mercury lines.acute poisoning occurs when a large dose of mercury vapor is inhaled or a mercury compound is ingested. it is mainly caused by acute corrosive stomatitis and gastroenteritis within a few minutes after taking it. the patient complains of burning sore throat, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting. there are often bloody mucus and exfoliated necrotic tissue in the stool and feces.mercury mining, amalgam smelting, gold and silver extraction, mercury rectifiers, as well as vacuum pumps, lamps, gauges, thermometers, amalgams, mercury, pigments, pharmaceuticals, nuclear reactor coolants and anti-atoms in the production workers of radiation materials, organic mercury compounds used to be mainly used as agricultural fungicides, but they are highly toxic and are no longer produced and used in china.","mercury poisoning can be treated with drugs such as sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate or sodium dimercaptosuccinate. mild chronic mercury poisoning can be cured, and patients do not have to worry about it. prevention should use comprehensive preventive measures to replace mercury with non-toxic or low-toxic materials, such as replacing mercury meters with electronic meters, replacing mercury thermometers with alcohol thermometers, and venting or sealing devices to avoid smelting or injecting mercury. mercury vapor escapes. timely removal and recovery of mercury remaining on the table, floor, and walls. the concentration of mercury in the air of the workshop is measured periodically. mercury workers should be physically examined once a year to detect mercury absorption and early mercury poisoning patients for early treatment. mercury-containing waste gas, wastewater, and waste residue should be disposed of after treatment. when the household mercury leaks, the method should be: if there is liquid, the sulfur powder should be sprinkled on it to allow it to react; if it has been volatilized, pay attention to indoor ventilation, and not directly contact with mercury by hand, mercury may cause skin irritation. metallic mercury adheres to the surface of the object for a long time and continues to evaporate at normal temperature. therefore, the surface of the wall, floor and console of the mercury workshop should be smooth and free of cracks, which is convenient for cleaning and detoxification. the temperature of the workshop should not exceed 15~16 ～c. the maximum allowable concentration of mercury in the air of the workshop is set at 0.001 mg/m3.","mercury poisoning is a common occupational poisoning because mercury is rich in fluidity and easily evaporates at room temperature.mainly occurs in the production of long-term inhalation of mercury vapor or mercury compound dust.productive poisoning is found in production workers such as mercury mining, amalgam smelting, gold and silver extraction, vacuum mercury, lighting, instrumentation, thermometers, fillings, mercury, pigments, pharmaceuticals, nuclear reactor coolants and atomic radiation protection materials. mercury is widely found in nature. various natural phenomena can make mercury continuously circulate from the surface through the atmosphere, rain and snow.  15. it is absorbed by animals and plants.human production activities can significantly increase the pollution of mercury to the environment.although the proportion of such artificial pollution is not large, but the concentration is concentrated, the damage is far more serious than natural pollution.the pollution of rivers, lakes and seas by mercury-containing sewage can cause pollution diseases such as waterlogging. short-term (>3~5 hours) inhalation of high concentration of mercury vapor (>1.0mg/m3) and oral administration of large amounts of inorganic mercury can cause acute mercury poisoning; taking or applying mercury-containing remedies can cause subacute mercury poisoning; occupational exposure to mercury vapor often caused by chronic mercury poisoning. pathogenesis: mercury ions are easily combined with sulfhydryl groups, which inactivate cytochrome oxidase, pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase, etc., which are related to sulfhydryl groups. mercury also binds to amino, carboxyl and phosphoryl groups to affect the activity of functional groups. because the activities of these enzymes and functional groups are affected, the biological activity and normal metabolism of cells are hindered, eventually leading to cell degeneration and necrosis. in recent years, mercury damage to the kidneys has been found, mainly in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, and mercury is still it can cause immune dysfunction, produce autoantibodies, and develop nephrotic syndrome or glomerulonephritis.","['mercury toxicity tremor', 'diarrhea', 'eye crystal anterior chamber brown light reflection', 'abdominal pain', 'gingle swelling', 'dizziness', 'disgusting', 'skull', 'blushing']",['renal failure'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

decompression sickness,"decompressionsickness (dcs), commonly known as diver's disease or caisson disease, is caused by improper decompression after operation in a high-pressure environment. the dissolved gas in the body exceeds the supersaturation limit, and bubbles form in the blood vessels and tissues. systemic disease.in the short-term or decompression process, the patients with acute decompression sickness mainly occur in the femur, tibia and fibula, and the slowly evolving ischemic bone or bone and joint damage is decompressive osteonecrosis.","1. for divers, especially new divers, medical knowledge should be educated to enable divers to understand the causes and prevention methods of decompression sickness. 2, develop good hygiene habits, establish a reasonable living system, rest before work to prevent excessive fatigue; do not drink alcohol and drink less water, work should be protected from cold and damp, work should immediately take off wet work clothes, drink hot tea, wash the hot water bath, rest in the warm room for more than half an hour to promote blood circulation, so that the excess nitrogen in the body is accelerated. 3, daily should ensure high calorie (generally about 15072 ~ 16747kj per day), high protein, medium fat diet, and appropriate increase of various vitamins, recent domestic useful rabbit experiments, showing that vitamin e has a certain prevention or reduce experimental the effect of decompression sickness may be due to the prevention or reduction of the release of biologically active substances such as serotonin in the stored particles in the platelets, so that intravascular coagulation does not occur. 4, before the diver employment, regular and pre-dive physical examination, bones and joints, especially the joints of the extremities should be x-rays every year, until the end of high-pressure operation four years, all suffering from hearing organs, cardiovascular system, digestion the system, respiratory system, nervous system and skin diseases are not suitable for high-pressure environment work. after serious illness, those with physical weakness, long-term fractures, alcoholics and obesity are also listed as employment taboos.","diving operations, caissons, special high-altitude flights, etc., if the decompression regulations are not observed, nitrogen bubble pressure or vascular embolism may occur, causing decompression sickness. when working underwater, the body is 10m per dive, which is roughly equivalent to increasing the pressure of one atmosphere. the added pressure is called the sum of additional pressure, additional pressure and ground pressure. it is called total pressure or absolute pressure (ata), and the body is at high pressure. under the environment, the partial pressure of various gases in the alveoli is increased, and it is immediately balanced with the partial pressure of various gases in the compressed air. because the partial pressure of the gas in the alveoli is higher than the pressure of the gas in the blood, the gas follows the law of boyle. correspondingly, the amount of dissolved gas in the blood is increased, and then transported to various tissues through the blood circulation. most of the oxygen and carbon dioxide are quickly absorbed by hemoglobin and plasma components, and only a small amount is physically separated from the body fluid, and the nitrogen is in the body fluid. the amount of dissolved in the air is proportional to the height of the gas pressure and the length of the residence time. because nitrogen has different solubility in various tissues, the distribution in the tissue is not equal. the solubility of nitrogen in fat is about 5 times that in the blood, so most of the nitrogen is concentrated. in fat and nerve tissue. when the human body gradually shifts from normal to high pressure, the excess nitrogen in the body is released from the tissue and enters the blood; and the alveoli gradually and slowly excreted from the body without adverse consequences. when the decompression is too fast, the total external pressure is excessive. it is impossible to continue to maintain the dissolved state, so it is free to the gas phase in a few seconds to a few minutes, and accumulates in the form of bubbles in the tissues and blood; the faster the decompression, the faster the bubble generation, the more the accumulation, the nitrogen can be long-term bubble state exists, in tissues with more fat and less blood circulation, such as adipose tissue, peripheral nerve myelin, central nervous white matter, connective tissue of tendon and joint capsule, etc., denitrification is difficult, in addition to intravascular bubbles, nitrogen bubbles often accumulate outside the walls of blood vessels, squeezing surrounding tissues and blood vessels, and stimulating nerve endings, even pressing, tearing tissue, causing local bleeding and other symptoms. in tissues with less fat and smooth blood flow, nitrogen bubbles are more in blood vessels. forming embolism, obstructing blood circulation, air bubbles and causing vasospasm, leading to distal tissue ischemia, edema and hemorrhage, according to the embolization site and its the degree of organization and nutritional disorders long time since temporarily, can produce a range of symptoms. in addition, due to the continuous formation of air bubbles inside and outside the blood vessels, causing tissue hypoxia and damage, the cells release potassium ions, peptides, histamines and proteolytic enzymes, which in turn stimulate the production of histamine and serotonin. it mainly acts on the microcirculatory system, causing vascular smooth muscle paralysis, microcirculatory vascular obstruction, etc., thereby reducing the desaturation rate of nitrogen in tissues and body fluids. therefore, in the pathogenesis of decompression sickness, bubble formation is the primary factor; the role of the air interface can still cause a series of pathophysiological reactions, which makes the clinical manifestations of decompression sickness complicated. the special role of the bubbles in the bones is that the bones are an inextensible tissue. the long bones in the long bones such as the femur, tibia, and tibia have high fat content, and the blood flow is very slow. when decompressed, a large amount of air bubbles will be generated to directly compress the blood vessels in the bone; there are also air embolism and thrombus in the vascular nutrient vessels, which can easily cause local infarction, and finally slowly cause aseptic ischemic osteonecrosis, also known as dysbaric osteonecrosis or aseptic osteonecrosis. in addition to the special role of bubbles in the bone, there are also a combination of fat embolism, platelet aggregation, gas induced osmotic pressure changes, autoimmune and other effects.","['pimples', 'itching', 'muscle soreness']","['hemangioma', 'acute hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis', 'colon atresia', 'congenital absence of duodenum, atresia and stenosis', 'duodenal vascular compression syndrome']","['surgery', 'infectious branch']","['supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

2 relieve bronchospasm; 3 with anti-inflammatory treatment to reduce airway swelling and secretion; 4 if necessary for tracheal intubation or trachea incision; 5 to give respiratory central stimulants; 6 grasp the indications, the correct use of mechanical assisted ventilation. fourth, improve hypoxic respiratory failure must have severe hypoxia, so correcting hypoxia, increasing pao2 level is necessary for each patient, the purpose is to strive to increase pao2 to 6.67 ~ 8.0kpa (50 ~ 60mmhg) in the short term. the arterial oxygen saturation rose to about 85%. type i respiratory failure has hypoxia and no carbon dioxide retention, and can inhale a higher concentration of oxygen (generally no more than 50%). in chronic type ii respiratory failure, due to changes in respiratory central reactivity, it is generally believed that oxygen supply is sustained in principle. low concentration and low flow rate are suitable, so pao2 should reach a safe level of 8.0 ~ 9.33kpa (60 ~ 70mmhg), in order to supply the necessary oxygen to the tissue without causing carbon dioxide anesthesia, and then adjust and gradually increase the concentration of inhaled oxygen according to the patient's condition. and the flow rate, such as the progressive increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide during oxygen supply, must be assisted by artificial ventilation to promote the discharge of carbon dioxide. fifth, close observation and monitoring, comprehensive treatment, pay attention to correct the acid-base balance disorder and water and electrolyte disorders;

2 non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema: the most common is acute respiratory distress syndrome, other recurrent pulmonary edema, acute mountain disease, etc. diseases can often cause severe hypoxemia. acute pulmonary infarction is a common cause of acute respiratory failure, and such diseases are fierce and have a high mortality rate. a large number of pleural effusions, spontaneous pneumothorax, chest wall trauma, chest surgery injury, etc., can affect thoracic movement and lung expansion, resulting in reduced ventilation and/or uneven distribution of inhaled gas, impairing ventilation and/or ventilation function, clinical type i respiratory failure is common, but severe type 2 respiratory failure can also be used. respiratory tract infections, respiratory tract burns, foreign bodies, and laryngeal edema cause acute infarction of the upper respiratory tract are common causes of acute type ii respiratory failure. patients with such diseases have no obvious pathological changes in the lungs, but are caused by impaired respiratory regulation or respiratory muscle dysfunction, resulting in type ii respiratory failure, such as guillain-barr谷 syndrome, which can damage peripheral nerves, severe muscle weakness, polymyositis, hypokalemia, periodic spasm and other respiratory muscle involvement; cerebrovascular accident, craniocerebral trauma, encephalitis, brain tumor, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypnotic poisoning caused by respiratory center inhibition. it must be borne in mind that type ii respiratory failure can occur in the late stage of type i respiratory failure, and type ii respiratory failure can be cured after type i respiratory failure, respiratory failure caused by airway obstruction and neuromuscular disorders. all are type ii respiratory failure. pathogenesis hypoxia and co2 retention are the basic pathophysiological changes of respiratory failure. figure 1 briefly illustrates the pathogenesis and pathophysiological characteristics of ards. 1. mechanism of hypoxia (1) ventilation disorder: severely insufficient alveolar ventilation leads to hypoxia and co2 retention. it is mainly caused by restricted lung expansion or increased airway resistance. normal lung expansion depends on respiratory center drive, nerve conduction, and inhalation. muscle contraction, diaphragmatic dilation, thoracic and alveolar dilatation, any of the above-mentioned obstacles such as respiratory central inhibition, respiratory muscle fatigue, decreased thoracic and lung compliance, etc. can lead to limited lung expansion and limited alveolar ventilation. insufficient obstructive alveolar ventilation is mainly caused by increased airway resistance. (2) ventilation disorder: 1 ventilation blood flow ratio imbalance: ratio <0.8 found in pulmonary edema, pneumonia, atelectasis, etc.; ratio > 0.8 seen in pulmonary embolism, extensive destruction of pulmonary capillary bed, partial pulmonary vasoconstriction. 2 dispersion disorders: seen in thickening of the respiratory membrane (such as pulmonary edema) and area reduction (such as atelectasis, lung consolidation), or pulmonary capillary hypovolemia (emphysema) and blood oxygenation rate slow (anemia) wait. characteristics of blood gas changes caused by simple ventilation disorder: only pao2 decreased, paco2 was normal or decreased; alveolar gas-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference p(aa)o2 increased. (3) increased oxygen consumption: fever, difficulty breathing, convulsions, etc. can increase oxygen consumption, which is an important reason for aggravating hypoxia. 2. the mechanism of co2 retention paco2 depends on the amount of co2 produced and discharged. the increase in co2 production, such as fever, hyperthyroidism, etc., rarely causes an increase in paco2. co2 retention is mainly caused by insufficient alveolar ventilation. therefore, paco2 is the best indicator of alveolar ventilation, and its elevation must be insufficient for alveolar ventilation.","['upper pulmonary fibrosis', 'cardiac arrest', 'respiratory failure', 'ring fingernail depression', 'heart rate increase', 'breathing difficulty', 'respiratory alkalosis', 'gas diffusion disorder', 'twitching', 'heart function suddenly decompensated']",['pulmonary edema'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
acute lung abscess,"acute lung abscess refers to a purulent infection of the lung caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria. in the early stage, it is an infectious inflammation of the lung tissue, followed by necrosis, liquefaction, and peripheral granulation tissue to form an abscess. the pathogenic bacteria of acute lung abscess are common bacteria in the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity.often mixed infections, including aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive cocci and negative bacilli.the most common pathogens are staphylococcus, streptococcus, pneumococci, and clostridium.anaerobic bacteria have certain importance for pulmonary suppurative infection. due to the improvement of culture technology, the positive rate has increased in recent years.the more important anaerobic bacteria are streptococcus faecium, fusarium, clostridium nucleatum, bacteroides, v. sphaeroides, spirochetes, and the like.in addition to the above anaerobic bacteria, there are also aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria mentioned above.in recent years, foreign countries have reported that pneumonia caused by legionella pneumophila can form abscesses.","lung abscess is a suppurative inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by a mixture of various pyogenic bacteria. the secretion of the mouth, nose and pharyngeal secretions containing the pathogen is the main cause of the disease. therefore, the key to prevent this disease is to actively remove and treatment of chronic infections of the mouth, nose and pharynx, such as dental caries, tonsillitis, paranasal sinusitis, alveolar pus, etc., to avoid excessive use of sedation, hypnosis, anesthetics and alcohol abuse, upper respiratory tract surgery and coma, general anesthesia people should strengthen nursing, prevent lung infection, treat early use of strong antibiotics, sputum drainage is also an important measure to improve the efficacy, the disease can be cured after active and effective treatment, for chronic lung abscess, especially antibiotic treatment after 3 months, there are still thick-walled cavities or repeated hemoptysis, and surgical resection can be considered.","infected bacteria of acute lung abscess, common upper respiratory tract, oral common bacteria, often mixed infection, including aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and negative cocci and bacilli, the most common pathogen is staphylococcus, chain cocci, pneumococcal, fusiform and spirochete, the importance of anaerobic bacteria for pulmonary suppurative infection, has been paid attention to in recent years due to improvements in culture techniques, gorbach and bartlett et al., 1974 report, aspiration pneumonia and lung the anaerobic infection of abscess accounts for about 85% to 90%. bartlett et al reported that 114 cases of anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 45 cases of acute lung abscess, accounting for 58% of anaerobic infections, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. mixed infection accounted for 42%, the more important anaerobic bacteria are streptococcus faecium, fusarium, clostridium nucleatum, bacteroides, v. vaginalis, spirochetes, etc. in addition to the above anaerobic bacteria, there is aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria exist. in recent years, pneumonia caused by legionella pneumophila has been reported abroad, and about 25% of them form abscesses. the pathogenesis of lung abscess is closely related to the cause, and can be divided into the following types. inhaled lung abscess pathogen oral, nasopharyngeal cavity inhalation, is the most common cause of lung abscess, tonsil inflammation, sinusitis, alveolar pyorrhage or age teeth and other purulent secretions, oral, nasal, pharyngeal surgery blood clots; tartar or vomit, etc., in the case of conscious coma, general anesthesia, etc., the trachea is inhaled into the lungs, causing obstruction of the bronchioles, and the pathogens can reproduce and cause disease. in addition, some patients fail to find obvious incentives. the reported cases are 29.3% and 23%, respectively. it may be due to cold, extreme fatigue and other incentives. the systemic immune status and respiratory defense function are reduced, and the secretions of the oral cavity are inhaled during deep sleep. for a single hairstyle, its occurrence is related to anatomy and body position. since the right common bronchus is straight and the diameter is thick, the inhaled secretion is easily inhaled into the right lung, so the right lung is more likely to be affected than the left lung. in the posterior segment of the upper lobe or the dorsal segment of the inferior lobe, in the sitting position, it occurs in the basal segment of the lower lobe, and in the right position, it occurs in the sub-segment formed in the anterior and posterior segments of the right upper lobe. blood-borne lung abscess skin trauma, infection, sputum, osteomyelitis, postpartum pelvic infection, subacute bacterial endocarditis and other sepsis and sepsis, pathogens (mostly staphylococcus aureus), sepsis the embolus is brought to the lungs through a small circulation, causing embolization of small blood vessels, inflammation and necrosis of the lung tissue, and formation of abscesses. the lesions are often multiple and have no distribution, often occurring at the margins of both lungs. secondary lung abscess is secondary to other diseases, such as staphylococcus aureus and pneumococcal pneumonia, cavitary tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, bronchial cysts and bronchial cancer and other secondary infections, can cause lung abscess, lung adjacent organs suppuration sexual lesions or traumatic infections, underarm abscesses, perirenal abscesses, paraspinal abscesses, perforation of the esophagus, etc., can also form abscesses when worn through the lungs. the amoebic lung abscess is secondary to the amoebic liver abscess. because the liver abscess occurs at the top of the right lobe of the liver, it is easy to break through the diaphragm to the right lower lobe, forming an amoebic lung abscess. early bronchiole obstruction, inflammation of lung tissue, embolization of small blood vessels, suppuration of the lung tissue, necrosis, formation of abscess, lesions can spread to the surrounding, and even beyond the interlobular fissure to invade adjacent lung segments, the thrombus causes local tissue ischemia, and encourages anaerobic infection, aggravation of tissue necrosis, liquefied pus, accumulation in the abscess causes increased tension, and finally rupture into the bronchi, coughing up a large amount of purulent, if the air enters the abscess, the liquid level appears in the abscess, sometimes inflammation spread to the surrounding lung tissue, can form a uniform number of abscesses, if the abscess is close to the pleura, localized fibrin pleurisy can occur, causing pleural adhesions, tension abscess at the edge of the lung, if it ruptures into the pleural cavity, the pus pneumothorax is formed. if the bronchial drainage is smooth, the necrotic tissue remains in the abscess cavity, and the inflammation persists, then it becomes a chronic lung abscess, the fibrous tissue around the abscess is hyperplasia, the wall of the abscess is thickened, and the surrounding bronchioles are involved, causing deformation. or expansion.","['cough foam mucus sputum', 'rotten peach-like bloody sputum', 'sputum is mucopurus', 'sufficiency', 'sputum viscous or purulent...', 'sputum is white viscous jelly', ' chills', 'be out of breath']",['lung abscess'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['antibiotics treatment', 'symptoms', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment if necessary']"

(1) disinfection of drinking water: adding chlorine or boiling can kill the bacteria. (2) the air-conditioning system should be shut down, disinfected and cleaned, and sanitized for water supply systems, wet equipment, sprayers, etc. to control the outbreak. (3) the immune vaccine is under development. preventive measures can be taken to address public health threats caused by legionnaires' disease, although it is not possible to eradicate the source of infection, but it can significantly reduce risks. legionnaires' disease prevention relies on good management of possible sources of infection, including regular cleaning and disinfection, and the use of other physics ( temperature) or chemical measures (biocides) to minimize growth. for example, the cooling tower can be cleaned and disinfected regularly, and biocides are added frequently or continuously; sufficient levels of chlorine and other organisms are killed in the hot spring pool. and completely drain the system at least once a week to clean the entire system; keep the hot and cold water system clean, keep the hot water at 60 degrees celsius, keep the cold water below 20 degrees celsius, or use a suitable biocide to limit growth, especially in hospitals, industrial sites, hotels, leisure centers, etc., will greatly reduce the possibility of legionella contamination and prevent the occurrence of sporadic cases. the current method is chlorination (1G10- 6) or intermittent high chloride method (50 G 10-6), but the method is easy to corrode the pipeline, once the degree of chlorination is reduced, legionella can benew is detected, it is ideal for disinfection measures, remains to be further studied.","legionella is an aerobic multi-sex gram-negative bacterium that is widely found in the natural environment. its source of infection is human, water and air-conditioning systems that are transmitted through the air. (1) causes of the disease according to the cell wall composition, biochemical reaction and dna hybridization research, legionella has nothing to do with the pathogens known in the past, so it constitutes a single family. legionellaceae has only one genus, legionella. up to now, 42 species and 64 serotypes have been found in the genus, of which about 19 are isolated from patients (table 1); the rest are isolated from the environment, and l1, lp3, lp5, lp6, lp9, etc. have been induced in china. the disease patients are mainly l. pneumophila (lp) and p. micdadei; legionella pneumophila has 15 serotypes, about 90% are serum type i, and legionella is gram negative. bacillus, (0.3 ~ 0.9) 米m G (2 ~ 4) 米m, occasionally filamentous, flagellate, mostly one, located at the top, aerobic, motivated, the bacteria do not grow in ordinary medium, the most suitable the medium is medicinal charcoal-yeast extract agar (bcye), the colony grows after 2-4 days, the diameter is 1-2 mm, flat or slightly convex, and the edges are neat, in fg (feeley-gorman) agar medium, 3 F5 days to culture the colon of the size of the needle tip, which can emit yellow fluorescence under ultraviolet irradiation. several strains of catalase are weakly positive, nitrate enzymes and urease are negative, only starch is used instead of other sugars. biochemical identification is generally not useful for identifying the bacteria, often based on growth and morphology, and finally serum. it is identified that the cell wall of the bacterium contains 14 to 17 carbon branched fatty acids, which can be detected by gas chromatography, unlike other bacteria. legionella can produce a variety of enzymes and toxins, including proteases, phosphonates, deoxyribonuclease, beta lactamase, and cytotoxins, which may be related to virulence. the bacteria have both internal and external toxins, their structure and others. gram-negative bacilli are slightly different, do not contain hydroxy fatty acids, but contain 2-keto-3-deoxyoctanoic acid and special branched-chain fatty acids. the bacteria live in fresh water in the natural environment, and the biofilm can survive in distilled water. 4 months, 3 months in river water, 1 year in tap water, legionella growth can be supported by some free living protozoa, or parasitic in its body, such as amoeba, protozoa and legionella, and protozoa can alter the virulence of legionella. (b) the pathogenesis of legionella pneumophila (lp) damage to the human body can be divided into indirect damage and direct damage, indirect damage from the role of alveolar macrophages (m耳), the study found that lp was after phagocytosis in m耳, it can inhibit the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes, and can regulate the ph value of mononuclear phagocytic cells to be suitable for survival and reproduction. lp captures m耳 by interfering with the depolarization of cells, and successfully completes immunization. escape, and use the nutrient factors of m耳 to continue to survive and multiply, and then cleave m耳, resulting in acute damage of alveolar epithelium and endothelium, accompanied by edema and fiber exudation. legionella can also cause damage by inducing apoptosis, lp direct damage is mainly caused by its hemolysin, cytotoxin and enzymes. the inhaled pathogen is swallowed by macrophages and propagates in its phagocytic vacuoles, producing cytotoxins, killing macrophages, and invading other macrophages, the presence of antibodies does not prevent the growth of pathogens, while cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in anti-infective effects. the factor can inhibit the proliferation of bacteria in macrophages. after that, antibodies, complement and polynuclear cells can eliminate the pathogens. most patients have lesions confined to the lungs. the consolidation lesions are mostly large-leaf, and a small part is focal or plaque. blocky distribution, death cases are generally involved in both lungs, there is no significant difference in the chance of involvement of the upper and lower leaves, lung tissue in the consolidation zone has congestion, edema and focal hemorrhage, often accompanied by a small amount of fibrinous pleurisy, microscopic examination mainly for fibrinous suppurative pneumonia, there is a large amount of neutrophil infiltration in the alveoli, and there are a large number of phagocytic cells. fibrin and moderate amounts of red blood cells and protein debris, some patients have acute diffuse alveolar damage, manifested as hyaline membrane formation, alveolar epithelial necrosis, shedding and regeneration, vascular endothelial cell swelling and degeneration, and a small number of inflammatory cells in the interstitial infiltration, electron microscopic observation of capillary and epithelial cell basement membrane is still intact, suggesting that normal structure and function can be restored, bronchial often no significant involvement, so patients with cough and sputum are not many, using modified dieterle saturated silver staining, giemsa staining, pathogens can be seen in phagocytic cells, neutrophils and extracellular, but non-specific, direct fluorescent antibody staining positive bacteria are specific, abscesses outside the chest are rarely seen, the pathogenesis of pontiac fever is still unknown according to epidemiological and bacteriological data, most people in the same building unit are inhaled by aerosols from air-conditioning systems. the water in the air-conditioning system is contaminated by legionella and other bacteria. the incubation period of this disease is 12 ~36h, this period is too short, it is difficult to explain with bacterial invasion and reproduction, may be a variety of bacterial toxins in the watercause; or an immune response to a variety of microorganisms in the water.","['shock', 'respiratory failure', 'muscle soreness', 'muscle pain', 'appetite loss', 'consciousness', 'lack of strength', 'hair lice', 'disgusting']","['pneumonia', 'respiratory failure', 'shock', 'brain edema', 'pancreatitis', 'pancreatitis', 'peritonitis']","['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['macrolide or fluoroquinolone treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
acute respiratory distress syndrome,"acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) is caused by intrapulmonary causes and/or extrapulmonary causes. clinical syndrome characterized by refractory hypoxemia is of great concern due to high mortality.the causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome are numerous, and the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by different causes is also different.most of the clinical manifestations include acute onset, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia that is difficult to correct with conventional oxygen therapy. at present, the ""berlin definition"" is used internationally to diagnose and severity stratify ards. the disease is diagnosed differentially.the contents of clinical examination include: diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment monitoring and guidance treatment, criticality and prognosis evaluation; acute respiratory distress syndrome treatment includes mechanical ventilation therapy and non-mechanical ventilation therapy, and its effective treatment methods are still continuing to explore. .","patients with high-risk should be closely observed and intensively monitored. once the respiratory rate is low, pao2 is lowered, and other lung injury manifestations are observed. when the primary treatment is open, respiratory support and other effective prevention and intervention measures should be given early to prevent further development of ards. and important organ damage. the prognosis of ards is related to the primary disease, complications and response to treatment. however, if the sepsis caused by severe infection is not controlled, the prognosis is very poor. the bone marrow transplantation is complicated by ards death. the rate is almost 100%. if the prognosis of multiple organ failure is extremely poor, and it is related to the number and speed of affected organs, such as 3 organ failures lasting more than 1 week, the mortality rate can be as high as 98%. after active treatment, if the continuous pulmonary vascular resistance increases, indicating a poor prognosis, ards caused by fat embolism, after active treatment, mechanical ventilation can achieve 90% survival, acute pulmonary edema and ards caused by irritating gas, generally off the scene, timely treatment, can also achieve better curative effect, another ards patients treated with peep0.98 (10cmh2o), pao2 increased significantly, the prognosis is good, most patients with ards can be quickly relieved, most of them can return to normal, 40% of pulmonary dysfunction among the ards restorers, 20% showed obstructive ventilatory damage, 30% decreased diffuse, and 25% decreased pao2 during exercise. once ards is present, the prognosis is more serious, and the treatment is complicated and difficult. the important thing is prevention and early treatment. ards is usually used as part of the systemic multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. in clinical practice, it is difficult to see simple ards while the patient does not merge with other patients. organ dysfunction, in fact, most patients with ards are caused by extrapulmonary dysfunction or trauma, infection, etc., and then cause dysfunction of the lung itself, further leading to lung infection, which in turn aggravates the disease of ards, so ards treatment as part of the systemic multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the basic concept of successful ards treatment. for shock and severe trauma patients, the following points should be noted: 1 rapid recovery of circulating blood volume after shock; 2 retention of airway catheter until the patient is fully awake and adequately ventilated; 3 actively encourage the patient to take deep breath; 4 often change position; 5 anyone who transfused more than 4 units should use standard filter to filter, and should avoid excessive infusion of old stock blood; 6 supplement nutrition; 7 control excessive excess infusion; 8 should not be too long for pure oxygen it is best to apply 40% oxygen; 9 to prevent gastric juice from inhaling into the lungs, especially for patients who are conscious of coma.","due to the low blood volume caused by massive blood loss, the traumatic output can be reduced, and the blood flow of the lungs is also reduced. due to the decrease of pulmonary blood volume and the micro-emboli that continuously receives the systemic circulation, the pulmonary vascular bed can be blocked. , which hinders the progress of gas exchange, and the contraction of bronchial and pulmonary small blood vessels caused by damaged blood cells and tissue decomposition products, which can increase capillary permeability, cause pulmonary interstitial congestion, edema, increase respiratory resistance, and thus last for a long time. on the basis of sexual shock, plus other factors, such as a large number of infusions, blood transfusions, etc., can lead to respiratory distress syndrome. fat embolism is a common complication after multiple fractures. large fat droplets can block the pulmonary arterioles and expand them. small fat droplets can be dispersed in many tiny blood vessels, causing extensive microcirculation embolism, while neutral fat is in lipase. under the action, it is decomposed into free fatty acids, which causes chemical inflammatory reactions, which can lead to pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage. it is clinically characterized by hypoxemia and is an important indicator of lung function damage. in severely traumatized people, due to the stress response, the reaction time of water and salt retention is relatively long, often exceeding 72 hours. therefore, a large amount of infusion after the injury can leave a few liters of water in the body, expanding the amount of extracellular fluid, and a large amount of electrolyte solution. it can also dilute plasma protein, reduce the colloid osmotic pressure of plasma, and promote pulmonary edema. in addition, if the lung itself is directly damaged by various reasons, such as contusion, aspiration, shock or sepsis, it is more normal than normal lung. it is easier to retain water, so even a slight infusion is prone to pulmonary edema. therefore, excessive infusion is a very important factor in many factors of acute respiratory distress syndrome. some authors have studied pulmonary edema in dogs. the difference in hydrostatic pressure between the extremities, small intestine and pulmonary capillaries was found to be edema when the capillary pressure of the limbs was 16 mmhg and the capillary pressure of the small intestine was 15.4 mmhg. pulmonary edema occurred when the pulmonary capillary pressure was 7.6 mmhg. suppurative infection can cause bacterial toxins or cell rupture products to enter the pulmonary circulation. under the action of endotoxin, vasoactive substances such as 5-hydroxylamine, histamine acetylcholine and catecholamine can be released in the body, which can increase capillary permeability and infection. it can also be transferred to the lungs, which can lead to pulmonary failure. in shock, multiple trauma and massive infusion, it is easy to cause sepsis in patients. severe craniocerebral trauma is often complicated by pulmonary edema. this is because brain trauma can stimulate strong sympathetic impulses, leading to significant peripheral vasoconstriction, followed by acute heart failure and pulmonary edema. if 汐-adrenergic blockers are used in advance, this damage can be prevented. recently, it has been found that the protein content in the effusion of post-traumatic pulmonary edema is high, so in addition to hypertensive edema, there may be a factor of permeability edema. as a cause of respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration has recently received attention. it is very serious to aspirate a large amount of acidic stomach contents. a small amount of acidic secretions with a ph lower than 2.5 can also cause serious consequences, causing chemistry. pneumonia and lung infections, which lead to respiratory failure. in respiratory failure, high-concentration oxygen is often used, but long-term use causes lung damage. the main factors that determine oxygen poisoning are the pressure of inhaled oxygen and the time of oxygen inhalation. the greater the inhaled oxygen pressure, the longer the time, the possible damage of oxygen to the body. the greater the lung oxygenation, the ciliary movement of the bronchi can be significantly inhibited, 100% oxygen inhalation for 6h, can produce asymptomatic acute bronchitis, sevitt through a large number of autopsy, that the transparent membrane and proliferative pneumonia as human lung the main pathophysiological changes of oxygen poisoning are ventilatory-perfusion imbalance, a large amount of blood flowing through the lungs, edema, ablation, mutation and fibrosis, resulting in a significant increase in physiologic shunt in the lungs. therefore, persistent hypoxemia occurs, and there is a gas diffusion disorder in the late stage, and the carbon dioxide discharge is blocked. even if the high concentration of oxygen is inhaled, the arterial oxygen partial pressure cannot be increased, and only the toxicity damage to the lung can be aggravated. animals often die from severe hypoxic heartbeats. the etiology of ards is based on the nature, and each category has several diseases or pathogenic factors. the etiology of ards varies, but the pathophysiology and clinical process are basically independent of the specific cause. the common basis is acute damage to the alveolar-capillary. the lung injury can be direct, such as inhalation of stomach acid or toxic gas, chest and wounds. etc. causes physicochemical damage to the endothelium or upper cells, and more often refers to indirect lung injury. although the mechanism of lung injury has not been fully elucidated so far, it has been confirmed to be part of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in alveolar capillaries. an acute inflammatory response mediated by cells and body fluids, involving two major processes, the migration and aggregation of inflammatory cells, and the release of inflammatory mediators, which complement each other and act on specific components of the alveolar capillary membrane, resulting in permeability. increase. pathogenesis so far, the mechanism of eigengenesis is still not very clear. some of the following mechanisms that have been envisioned by scholars have not explained all the morbid conditions. the incidence of each specific patient often requires several mechanisms. clarify. 1. pulmonary edema trauma, shock and various pathogenic factors make the pulmonary circulation insufficient blood perfusion, can directly damage the alveoli and capillaries, caused by various damage media, such as microthrombus, vasoactive substances or inflammatory mediators damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane increases its permeability, and fluid can leak from the capillaries into the alveoli or interstitial, causing pulmonary edema. in addition, shock, trauma or other pathogenic factors can cause cerebral perfusion. the brain metabolism is reduced, and the reflex pulmonary vasospasm is generated, which causes an increase in pulmonary venous pressure, and an infusion excess also accelerates pulmonary edema. it has been observed that granulocytes in the blood circulation, platelets and tissue macrophages contain various inflammatory mediators, such as lysosomal hydrolase and phospholipase of granulocytes. when they are released into the pulmonary circulation, they can make alveolar capillaries. the vascular membrane produces extensive damage, which increases permeability, and proteins, blood cells and fluids can leak out of the blood vessels. at the same time, platelets can decompose histamine, serotonin and kinins, shrinking vascular endothelial cells, widening the intercellular space, and protein. such as easy to seep, it is also conducive to the formation of pulmonary edema. at first, the edema fluid only appeared in the interstitial tissue around the pulmonary arterioles, and gradually increased to the respiratory bronchioles. finally, the entire alveoli were filled, and the ventilation/blood perfusion ratio was imbalanced to form hypoxemia. 2. microthrombus formation in the lungs solliday et al believe that various damage factors may increase the amount of catecholamines in the body, and sometimes cause an increase in iatrogenic catecholamines during the treatment. the increase of catecholamines is beneficial to induce platelet aggregation and form microthrombus. when they flow to the lungs, they can block the small arteries of the lungs, causing pulmonary circulatory disorders. agglutinated platelets can also release serotonin and histamine, which can cause bronchospasm, affecting the ventilatory function of the lungs. when thrombosis occurs, fibrinogen is converted to in fibrin, vasoactive peptides are also released, which can increase local vascular and bronchospasm, increase pulmonary hypertension, increase alveolar capillary permeability, and produce alveolar and interstitial hemorrhage, edema, and alveolar fibrin deposition. in addition, embolization can affect the blood flow of pulmonary vascular blood vessels, causing the destruction of lung tissue structure, and finally reduce lung compliance, resulting in respiratory distress syndrome, but malik et al believe that microthrombus must exist simultaneously with intravascular coagulation. respiratory distress syndrome can occur. 3. reduction of alveolar surfactant production when respiratory distress syndrome occurs, type i alveolar epithelial cells are often damaged, and its destruction not only seriously impairs the integrity of alveolar capillaries in the vascular barrier, but also must be type ii epithelium. cell differentiation replaces the damaged type i epithelial cells, so it directly affects the quantity and quality of alveolar surfactant. in addition, due to alveolar edema fluid filling, the activity of alveolar surfactant is also reduced, alveoli will tend to shrink, so the lungs the capacity can be reduced, resulting in difficulty breathing. the respiratory distress syndrome that occurs after trauma, surgery or other diseases often has a certain incubation period. the half-life of the surfactant is 18 to 24 hours, and the two are similar in time. therefore, some people think that the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome is due to the surface. reduced production of active substances. 4. the pathological basis of ards is pulmonary capillary membrane damage caused by a variety of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes) mediated by local inflammatory reactions and inflammatory responses. the pathological feature is the formation of protein-rich pulmonary edema and transparent membrane in the alveolar exudate caused by increased pulmonary microvascular permeability, which may be associated with pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. in the first 18 hours after the onset of clinical symptoms, the lungs were generally not significantly, with only a small amount of scattered hyperemia and atelectasis. after 18 to 72 hours after shock, the lesions were severe, showing a hemorrhagic lesion in the entire lung. severe pulmonary venous congestion, scattered thromboembolism, interstitial edema, vascular and peri-bronchial hemorrhage and alveolar hemorrhage. 72 hours later, clear membrane and bronchial pneumonia were observed, followed by diffuse fibrosis, and exudative proliferative changes were simultaneously the characteristics of pathological changes can be summarized as follows: (1) exudation period (24 ~ 48h): alveolar and interstitial edema, capillary congestion, type i alveolar cell destruction, early transparent membrane formation, protein content of edema fluid and the composition is similar to plasma. the endothelial cells of pulmonary microvessels are almost intact. there is no gap at the junction of cells. however, red blood cells can be found in the interstitium, suggesting a short leak in the pulmonary microvascular endothelium, probably due to stronger endothelial cells. the ability to repair makes it difficult to detect transient damage to the endothelial layer. (2) cell proliferative phase (3-7 days): type ii cells proliferate, inflammatory cells infiltrate the lung septum, and the hyaline membrane is mechanized. after the exudation period, the type ii cells begin to proliferate rapidly as an initial repair reaction. the underlying disease is not controlled and produces sustained damage stimuli. in this period, neutrophils attach to the surface of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, and pulmonary vascular microthrombus formation. the changes of lung parenchyma are characterized by thickening of the epithelial layer and obvious interstitial swelling, microvessels are greatly reduced or collapsed by compression, and the interstitial enlargement in this period is due to edema and cell proliferation. (3) fiber proliferative phase (>7-10 days): fibrosis of hyaline membrane and alveolar septum, alveolar duct fibrosis. (4) microscopic examination: alveolar expansion, alveolar pores increased significantly, capillaries in the alveolar wall were more clear, some type i alveolar and capillary endothelial cells were swollen, fibrin, platelets, red blood cells were seen in alveolar capillaries and leukocyte accumulation, in most lung tissues, white blood cells increased significantly. on the surface of red blood cells and alveolar cells, cellulose-like substances were observed. the nuclear chromatin of type ii cells became thick, the perinuclear space was widened, and mitochondria were disordered or disappeared. the expansion of the plastid network, the destruction of the lamellar structure or the emptying phenomenon, so there are vacuoles of different sizes in the cytoplasm of type ii cells. in the alveolar cavity, free or agglomerated white blood cells, red blood cells, macrophages and exfoliated type ii cells, some alveolar cavities are also covered with edema fluid or other mucus-like secretions, the interstitial space of the interstitial part of the lung is widened, and edema may occur to varying degrees. occasionally, the elastic fibers and collagen fibers are sparsely arranged and disordered. the alveolar structure is blurred and the boundary is unclear. the surface of alveolar epithelial cells can be covered by criss-crossing cellulose. (1) migration and aggregation of inflammatory cells almost all intrapulmonary cells participate in the pathogenesis of ards to varying degrees, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns), one of the most important effector cells of acute inflammation of ards, are isolated and isolated. there are only a small amount of pmns in the mass, accounting for 1.6%, in trauma, sepsis, acute pancreatitis, physical and chemical stimulation or extracorporeal circulation, due to endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (lps), c5a, interleukin-8 (il) -8) other factors, pmns accumulate in the capillary capillaries, firstly the coanda flow and adhere to the endothelial cells, and then transend the endothelium to the pulmonary interstitial, and then moved to the alveolar space by alveolar epithelial desquamation, which in a process, there are many kinds of adhesion molecules involved in the regulation and regulation. the respiratory outburst and release of pmns are important links of lung injury. alveolar macrophages (ams) are also inflammatory reactions in addition to phagocytic cells and antigen-presenting cells of immune response. the important effector cells involved in the pathogenesis of ards, stimulated and activated ams release il-1, tumor necrosis factor-汐 (tnf-汐) and il-87, etc., which promotes chemotaxis and aggregation of pmns in the lung is likely to be the initiation of ali. factor, platelet aggregation and microembolism is a common pathological change of ards. it is speculated that platelet aggregation and microembolism are common pathological changes of ards. it is speculated that platelets and their products play an important role in the mechanism of ards. in recent years, structural cells such as pulmonary capillaries and alveolar epithelial cells have been found. not only the target cells, but also participate in the inflammatory immune response, which has special significance in the secondary inflammation of ards. (b) the release of inflammatory mediators the activation and release mediators of inflammatory cells are accompanied by inflammatory reactions, which are inseparable. they are discussed separately for convenience of description. take bacterial lps stimulation as an example, which binds to macrophage surface receptors. cell shedding and organelle release numerous mediators, including: 1 lipid mediators such as arachidonic acid metabolites, platelet activating factor (paf); 2 reactive oxygen metabolites with superoxide anion (o2-), hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2), hydroxyl radical (oh{) and monomeric oxygen (io2), in addition to h2o2, symmetric oxygen itself is exaggerated, 3 peptides such as pmns/ams protease, complement substrate, various components involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis processes , cytokines, and even some of the integrins that belong to the steroid family of adhesion molecules are also listed in such media. (iii) alveolar capillary damage and increased permeability the components that maintain and regulate capillary structural integrity and permeability include extracellular matrix, intercellular connections, cytoskeletal and interactions between cytosolic transport and cellular substrates, ards direct and indirect damage can affect each of the above steps, oxygen self-base, protease, cytokines, arachidonic acid metabolites and high-charged products (such as neutrophil major cationic protein) can be obtained through the following pathways altering the permeability of the membrane barrier; (1) lysing the basement membrane protein and/or cell adhesion factor; (2) altering the extracellular matrix of the extracellular matrix; (3) affecting the fibril system of the cytoskeleton, resulting in cell deformation and tearing of the junction. pathophysiology (1) the basic pathophysiology can be expressed in figure 1. it should be pointed out that the damage and pathological changes of ards are generally considered to be diffuse. in recent years, studies on imaging and application of inert gas to determine gas exchange have shown that lung injury is not as diffuse and uniform as it was understood in the past, so a ※two-compartment model§ is proposed: one is a near-normal lung, and there is no difference in the pressure and ventilation response applied to it; the second compartment is a diseased lung, dilation and ventilation are reduced, but with disproportionate blood flow, many open lung units in the early two chambers can be interchanged as the applied pressure increases or the position changes, so the pressure-T curve is significantly delayed and presented. biphasic morphology, early pulmonary edema reduces alveolar volume, in a sense, only the volume of filling is reduced, rather than the lung volume itself, the total lung and thoracic volume in the functional residual position are in the normal range, specific lung compliance specific compliance, ie compliance/lung volume, is also normal. (2) oxygen consumption - pathological dependence of oxygen supply and multiple organ failure in recent years, some studies have found that there is an abnormal relationship between oxygen consumption and oxygen supply (vo2qo2) in ards, and that this common pathophysiological basis of ards and multiple organ failure, healthy human oxygen supply can change, even if reduced, and organ oxygen intake and consumption remain relatively stable, that is, the oxygen consumption of the organ is not dependent on oxygen supply above the critical threshold, but is due to local compensatory effects and increased capillary perfusion and increased oxygen uptake. this compensation mechanism in ards depletion, the absolute dependence or pathological dependence of oxygen consumption on oxygen supply occurs at all oxygen supply levels (fig. 2). this pathological phenomenon shows va/q ratio imbalance in the lung and tissue and capillaries in the extrapulmonary organs. inter-oxygen exchange disorder, abnormal vo2/qo2 relationship leads to cell oxygenation and metabolic disorders, causing damage. the imbalance of oxygen supply and demand stems from the depletion of local compensatory mechanism. the explanation is that redistribution of blood flow to low-lying organs such as skeletal muscle. , causing the need for vital organ oxygen supply; another kind of cleanliness is the capillary damage of vital organs, tissue edema, increased diffusion distance and reduced hair cell cross-sectional area, causing damage the basic reason is the general activation of inflammatory cells and the release of mediators. at present, it tends to the latter view. it is believed that ards and multiple organ failure have a common pathogenesis. because of the abundant abundant capillary beds, it is often the first target of inflammatory damage. organs, the early rescue of ards is effective or causes the cause of systemic inflammatory response is self-limited or controlled, the disease course only shows ards without multiple organ failure, ards develops or evolves into multiple organ failure, infection may be the most important trigger or the driving factor. [pathological changes] the pathological changes of ards caused by various causes are basically the same, which can be divided into three interrelated and partially overlapping stages of exudation, hyperplasia and fibrosis. (1) the exudation period is seen in the first week after the onset of the disease. the lungs are dark red or dark purple liver-like changes. it can be seen that edema, hemorrhage, and weight increase. during the 24-hour period, microscopic blood vessel congestion, hemorrhage, microthrombus, and lung there is protein edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitial and alveolar. if it is caused by a sensible cause, the accumulation and infiltration of pmns in the alveolar cavity is more obvious. after 72 hours, the plasma protein is coagulated, the cells are fragmented, and the cellulose forms a transparent membrane. sexual or large alveolar atelectasis, impaired necrosis of type i cells during acute exudation. (2) 1 to 3 weeks after the proliferative injury, the type ii lung epithelial cells proliferate and cover the basement membrane of exfoliation, fibrosis can be seen in the alveolar sac and alveolar duct, and fibrocytic intimal hyperplasia occurs in the muscular small arteries, resulting in the cross-sectional area of the vascular lumen. cut back.

idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic interstitial lung disease that is confined to the lungs and occurs in the middle-aged and elderly

distributed. according to statistics, the prevalence rate in the whole population is about (2~29)/100,000 per year, and it is gradually increasing. it is estimated to be 11% per year. the proportion has increased.there are approximately 100,000 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the united states, approximately 110,000 in the european union, and 35,000 new ipf patients in the eu each year.the prevalence of ipf in the overall population in japan is about (2.23 to 10) per 100,000, and the actual value is much higher than this number.as a country with severe aging, the number of patients with ipf is increasing year by year, and the conservative estimate is at least 500,000.as a chronic interstitial lung disease, ipf onset is concealed, the condition is gradually worsened, and it can also be manifested as acute exacerbation.the average survival after ipf diagnosis is only 2.8 years, and the mortality rate is higher than most tumors. ipf is called a ""tumor-like disease."" according to the international multidisciplinary classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (iips) published by the american thoracic society/european respiratory society in 2013, iips are divided into major iips, rare iips, and iips that cannot be classified.there are 6 types of major iips, including ipf, idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (insip), respiratory bronchiolitis with interstitial lung disease (rb-ild), and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (dip). ), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (cop), acute interstitial pneumonia (aip).there are two types of rare iips, including idiopathic lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (ilip) and idiopathic pleural pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis (ippfe).ipf is the most common type of major idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.","1. due to the slow course of the disease, medical staff should carefully check and confirm the diagnosis. 2, to encourage patients to establish confidence in the fight against disease,

smokers must quit smoking. 5, patients should be encouraged to participate in lung rehabilitation exercise programs such as walking every day, stepping on a fixed bicycle, etc., although can not increase lung capacity, but can change the tolerance of activities, reduce the symptoms of dyspnea, improve the quality of life.","the early stage of pf may produce an anti-specific immune response. the inflammatory response of the lower respiratory tract is the earliest detectable damage in the lungs, interstitial and alveolar lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, and t lymphocytes in ipf. the regulation of lung injury and disease progression plays a dual role. the t lymphocytes obtained from the alveoli of ipf patients are activated, which can express il-2 receptor and secrete inf-污. the products secreted by t lymphocytes can inhibit fibroblasts. the proliferation of cells can also enhance the collagen synthesis of fibroblasts. in addition, t lymphocytes also have a huge auxiliary effect on b lymphocytes, which is very important for enhancing the production of immune complexes. the production of specific immune responses in the lung parenchyma is important for the accumulation of inflammatory cells affecting lung tissue. selective adhesion molecules, adhesion molecule binding molecules and immunoglobulins play important roles in the interaction between inflammatory cells and endothelial cells. the strong adhesion of many cells depends on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) and leukocyte antigen-1 (lfa-1). tnf-汐 induces icam-1 expression on the surface of endothelial cells. extravascular leukocytes include lfa-1 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecules are expressed at the junction of leukocytes and endothelial cells, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (urokinase u-pa) may be different during the movement of inflammatory cells from blood vessels to alveolar spaces. the degradation products of tissue proteolytic enzymes, the direct migration of inflammatory cells of ipf depend on a variety of chemicals, including chemokines interleukin-1 (il-1) monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), macrophages inflammatory protein-ia (mip-1a), complement component c5a, cytokine (mcp-1, mip-1a, fibronectin including rgd acting on macrophages, leukotriene b4 (ltb4), il-8 and effects leukocyte c5a, t lymphocytes,macrophages, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts are important sources of these cytokines, and urokinase receptors (u-par, cd87) are essential chemokines for monocytes and pmn, and u-par may affects leukocyte circulation and activates the adhesion function of complement receptor 3. epithelial cell damage is a hallmark of ipf. viral infection and inflammatory cell products (oxygen free radicals, proteolytic enzymes) are mediators of damage. epithelial cell damage causes plasma proteins to exude into the alveolar space. during the injury process, the alveolar basal layer also the presence of destructible, activated inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, pmn) contributes to the continuous development of alveolar wall damage. successful repair of damaged alveoli requires removal of plasma proteins entering the alveolar space, replacing the damaged alveolar wall, re-storing the damaged extracellular matrix, and alveolar exudate formed during inflammatory reactions including many cytokines and media such as growth factors (platelet growth). factor, metastatic growth factor-汕, insulin-like growth factor-i), fibronectin, thromboxane, fibrin peptide, etc., alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages regulate the formation and clearance of cellulose in the alveoli due to the presence of 米-pa there is reticular fibrin degradation activity in the alveolar cavity. however, fibrin degradation activity in bal of ipf patients is due to plasminogen activator and plasmin such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1). the level is increased and inhibited. similarly, fibronectin in the alveolar space is also inhibited. if the exudate in the alveoli is not removed, the fibroblasts will invade and proliferate, producing new matrix proteins, making the fiber rich. the exudate of the prime becomes a scar. arachidonic acid metabolism also plays an important role in the fibrosis reaction of ipf. interleukin has a direct effect on fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells, stimulates fibroblasts to release chemokines, promote cell proliferation and collagen synthesis, and alveolar repair. an important feature of the epithelial remodeling of the alveolar basement membrane, in order to complete this process, type ii alveolar epithelial cells proliferate, the final basement membrane surface repair, local exudate mechanization, this process is undoubtedly in keratinocyte growth factor under the influence of hepatocyte growth factor, these two factors regulate epithelial cell proliferation and migration. during the formation of ipf, epithelial cells are missing, alveolar collapses, and a mass of scars is formed when a large number of alveoli are involved. pathogenesis histology of lung biopsy specimens is important to rule out other diagnoses and quantification of fibrosis and inflammation. the main pathological features of ipf include alveolar septum (interstitial) and alveolar fibrosis and inflammation at different degrees because of many inflammatory properties. pulmonary diseases can have similar manifestations, so granulomas, vasculitis, inorganic pneumoconiosis or organic pneumoconiosis must be ruled out. the pathological changes of ipf are diverse and distributed in patches, mostly in the periphery of the lungs ( subpleural), even in the severely affected lung lobe, some alveoli can be protected from involvement. in the early stage of the disease, the alveolar structure can remain intact, but the alveolar wall edema thickens, and the interstitial inflammatory cells accumulate, mainly monocytes ( such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes, macrophages, but also scattered polynuclear neutrophils and eosinophils. in the early stage of the disease, alveolar macrophages are focally clustered, and alveolar macrophages in moderate or advanced ipf are absent. as the disease progresses, chronic inflammatory infiltration becomes less and less obvious, and the alveolar structure is densely fibrous. instead, the alveolar wall breaks and breaks, leading to airway cystic dilatation (honeycomb lung), advanced disease, massive pulmonary collagen in the interstitial lung, intracellular matrix, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells are few or even absent, and the course of disease is longer. alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, some patients may have smooth muscle reactive hyperplasia, pulmonary artery dilatation, secondary pulmonary hypertension and other changes, airway can be distorted, leading to ""traction bronchiectasis"", such as smoking ipf the patient has a change in emphysema, which can distinguish between emphysema and honeycomb lung depending on the presence of fibrous tissue around the cystic cavity. diffuse alveolar damage is not a feature of early ipf, but can also be found in many other lung diseases such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards), inhaled lung injury, radiation-induced lung injury, drug-induced lung injury, collagen vascular disease, infection, etc. i have previously subjectively divided ipf into several pathological subtypes, suggesting that desquamative interstitial pneumonia (dip) and common interstitial pneumonia (uip) are pathological types of ipf at different stages of the disease, according to the american thoracic society.

idiopathic obstructive bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia,"obstructive bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia (bronchiolitis obhterans with organizing pneumonia, boop) is a new disease in ep1er equal to the first proposed interstitial lung disease in 1985, mainly characterized by obliterative bronchiolitis, organizing pneumonia and qualitative pneumonia and fibrosis, its bronchioles are not as extensive as classic bronchiolitis, which accounts for a large proportion of organizing pneumonia, which is different from mechanized lesions after infectious pneumonia, and interstitial the lesions are mainly inflammation of the alveolar wall. although there is mild to moderate fibrosis, there is no honeycomb lung, which has a good response to steroid therapy. therefore, it is significantly different from ipf and can be secondary to other pathological processes, including cryptococcus. disease, wegener granulomatosis, lymphoma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and eosinophilic pneumonia.no obvious cause was idiopathic obstructive bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia.idiopathic obliterative bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia (esthetic boop), a special clinical pathological syndrome of unknown etiology, can develop focal organizing pneumonia, is a small airway granulation diseases caused by tissue obstruction can sometimes completely block small airways, and granulation tissue can extend to alveolar ducts and alveoli.its characteristics include: connective tissue proliferation forms intracavitary polyps; fiber exudation; alveolar macrophage accumulation; alveolar wall inflammation; but lung tissue structure is still intact, the course of disease progresses slowly.","because this disease is a special clinical pathological syndrome with unknown etiology, improving the living environment and changing bad habits, such as smoking and drinking, improving autoimmune function, is the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease.","as a special clinical pathological syndrome with unknown etiology, it can develop into focal organizing pneumonia, and fibrotic granuloma tissue obstructs bronchioles and alveolar ducts.","['fever"", 'cough with chest pain', 'twirl pronunciation', 'sparse increase', 'lack of strength', 'fever with cough, slightly...', 'wasting']",['allergic pneumonia'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
idiopathic hemosiderin,"idiopathicpulmomaryhaemosiderosis (iph) it is a rare disease with repeated causes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.long-term repeated alveolar hemorrhage causes pulmonary hemosiderin to precipitate, which can eventually lead to pulmonary fibrosis.the vast majority of alveolar hemorrhage caused by hemosiderosis can be found, and finally the clinical and laboratory examination can not find the cause of hemosiderosis, called idiopathic lung hemosiderinosis.therefore, some scholars have suggested replacing the iph with the term idiopathicpulmonary hemorrhage.","some children with milk allergy have positive skin test in milk, and serum is found to react with milk antigen. related to exposure to organophosphorus pesticides cassimos surveyed 30 children who had developed the disease in greece and found that 80% of them grew up in the countryside, with poor economic conditions and less protein in the diet; 50% of the children continued exposure to the history of organophosphate pesticides.cassimos believes that pesticides may induce this disease in some children, and the exact basis needs further investigation.","in 1955, probst proposed an unusual acidic mucopolysaccharide on elastic fibers. later, heiner et al. suggested that it may be allergic to milk, but in 1974 and 1975, irwin and donlan found that the capillary basal layer was normal.in 1976, gonzales-crussi et al. suggested that the capillary basement membrane may be proliferative, and the epithelial basement membrane is normal. in any case, after many years of research, no epithelium or basal of pulmonary vessels has been found in the lung tissue of patients with iph. damage to the membrane.later, 10 children with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage appeared in cleveland, ohio, usa. it was found that these children were exposed to stamedbotrys chartarum-contaminated water. therefore, some scholars believe that environmental factors may be in the pathogenesis of iph. some triggers.up to now, most scholars believe that there may be an immune factor that is not known to cause the disease, and genetic factors may also play a certain role.","['hemosiderinosis', 'chest pain', 'breathing difficulties', 'internal bleeding', 'hemoptysis', 'weakness', 'low fever']",['iron deficiency anemia'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['no specific treatment, symptomatic treatment']"
exogenous allergic alveolitis,"exogenous allergic alveolitis (extrinsicallergicalveolitis) is an allergic alveolitis caused by repeated inhalation of certain antigenic organic dust, often involving the terminal bronchioles.the us literature uses the name hypersensitivity pneumonitis.the domestic reports mainly include farmers' lungs, bagasse workers' lungs, mushroom workers' lungs, parrots' lungs and humidifiers' lungs. although their causes are numerous, pathological, clinical symptoms, signs and x-ray findings are very similar.","completely avoid contact with pathogenic organic dust is the most fundamental prevention and control measures, improve the production environment, pay attention to dust, ventilation, and strictly abide by the operating procedures such as harvested hay and grain should be dried and put into the warehouse; places where poultry are kept are often cleaned and properly disposed of. bird droppings; the water in the humidifier and air conditioning system is kept clean and avoids pollution; for operators in the environment polluted by organic dust, it is advisable to have regular medical monitoring, and there are obvious chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic asthmatic bronchitis and bronchi. asthma, chronic obstructive emphysema and allergic constitutions should not be engaged in close contact with organic dust.","exogenous allergic alveolitis has many causes, such as actinomycetes and fungal spores, animal and plant proteins, bacteria and their products, insect antigens and certain chemical substances, and some of the dust's antigenic properties are still unclear. it is generally believed that the cause of peasant lungs is mainly common high-temperature actinomycetes. in recent years, domestic scholars have reported another high-temperature actinomycete associated with peasant lungs, a thermostable streptomyces, in many antigens, thermophilic actinomycetes are the most common and important, especially microspores, followed by common high-temperature actinomycetes, which have the form of fungi, but belong to bacteria, which are produced in moist, warm, mildewed organisms, compost, soil, food and contaminated water contain a large amount of this bacteria. farmers inhale moldy hay, cereals and sugarcane are often prone to disease. there are many thermophilic actinomycetes in the air of mushroom cultivation and production environment, and they are released at ordinary high temperature. the main bacteria, the inhalation of the grower can lead to the mushroom work lungs, the lungs of the poultry breeders (such as the pigeons, the parrots, etc.) are due to bird serum, bird droppings, birdsit is caused by powder cream and bird eggs. some people think that the powder cream on the pigeon feather is a keratin particle antigen of about 1米m in size, and its pathogenic effect is more important than pigeon serum and excrement. workers inhale the silk dust in the air of the workshop (probably sericin) and cause allergic alveolitis. the cause of the humidifier and air conditioner lung is white thermophilic actinomycetes, which are widely used in the chemical industry. after inhalation of cyanide or phthalic anhydride, the hapten may also cause allergic alveolitis. the antigenic properties of tobacco growers, tea growers, etc., are not fully understood. in recent years, exogenous allergic alveolitis is considered to be an immune complex disease. type iii allergy is an important mechanism, and it also involves type iv allergy. activation of the complement system has important significance, and activated alveolar macrophages may be the onset. the central link of the mechanism. (1) complement-mediated type iii allergic reaction occurs 4 to 8 hours after the sensitized individual is exposed to the antigen again. arthus reaction can occur 4 to 6 hours after intradermal injection of the antigen, and igg is found in the skin specimen at the reaction site. and the precipitate of complement, the precipitated antibody (genus igg) of the corresponding antigen can be found in the serum of most patients. the application of antigen for bronchial provocation test can show the same lung function change as clinical exogenous allergic alveolitis, so the disease and complement it is related to the type iii allergy, and the immune complex is of great significance. (ii) t lymphocyte-mediated type iv allergic reaction in recent years, it is noted that type iv allergic reaction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. the pathology of patients has a formation of caseous granuloma, and lymphocytes encounter corresponding antigens in vitro. it can produce macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif). animal experiments have found that sensitized t lymphocytes are implanted into experimental animals, and then inhaled antigen to stimulate, causing lung injury similar to human exogenous allergic alveolitis. in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with exogenous allergic alveolitis, the increase of lymphokines was also found. all of the above findings support the role of type iv allergy in the pathogenesis of this disease. (c) the role of local macrophages with mildew and subtilis can directly stimulate alveolar macrophages to cause proteolytic enzyme release, cleavage of c3 and release c3b, the latter binds to the complement receptor on the surface of macrophages further activation of macrophages, followed by lung tissue lesions including granuloma formation. at present, it is apt to think that exogenous allergic alveolitis is initially mediated by type iii allergic reaction, and then turns to type iv allergic reaction, while macrophage activation and the resulting inflammatory response can be through non-immune pathways. causes lung damage, but many details are unclear.","['pulmonary interstitial fibrosis', 'respiratory failure', 'weight loss', 'breathing difficulties', 'allergic cough', 'chest tightness', 'tachycardia', 'be out of breath']",['pulmonary heart disease'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
pediatric tuberculosis,"tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. it can be involved in all organs of the body, but tuberculosis is the most common.pediatric tuberculosis refers to tuberculosis in children between the ages of 14 and 14 years.in early childhood, tuberculosis is easy to form hematogenous dissemination and tuberculous meningitis.early detection and early treatment of primary pulmonary tuberculosis in children is important for further reducing tuberculosis mortality.primary infection of tuberculosis in children is the main source of tuberculosis in adulthood. therefore, in order to control and eliminate tuberculosis, we must attach great importance to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis in children.","1. strengthen primary health care depends on the strength of urban and rural primary health care networks, and give full play to the role of doctors at all levels, including rural doctors.clinically, the incidence of tuberculosis is closely related to the health status and living environment of children.attention should be paid to reasonable nutritious hygienic habits and prevention of measles pertussis. 2. early detection ofearly detection and prevention of casesis a prerequisite for early treatment of children.regular physical examination to detect early exposure to active tuberculosis patients, the incidence and prevalence of infection rate are significantly higher than the average child.according to beijing children's hospital, the prevalence of children exposed to children from 1962 to 1965 was 6.5%, while the prevalence of group children was 0.15%.according to the average follow-up observation of active pulmonary tuberculosis patients, the cumulative prevalence rate was 6%.therefore, it is an important way for early detection of tuberculosis by examining the presence or absence of tuberculosis infection or illness in children.secondly, in children with strong ot reaction, special attention should be paid to early detection. although tuberculosis is a chronic and extremely stubborn infectious disease, it can be cured if it can be followed up early. 3. carry out missions, attach importance to isolation and conduct extensive health education, so that the masses have a correct understanding of tuberculosis and work as a disinfection and isolation for tb patients' families.protect children from infection.collective institutions, such as nursery nurseries and primary school nurses and teachers, should regularly check for tuberculosis. once active patients are found, they should leave their jobs and be actively treated.hiring a babysitter or hiring a tutor in a family should first perform a chest ray to ensure that there is no tuberculosis.in addition, pay attention to other preventive measures, such as dairy dairy management, pre-marital check-up, pregnancy check-up, and promotion without spitting. 4. bcg was inoculated in 1908. callemette and gu谷rin were applied to 5% glycerol bile potato medium on 5% glycerol bile potato medium. after 13 years of repeated culture, the bacteria lost. the performance of the disease is then made into a bacterin (bcg bcg), which is inoculated into the human body to give the recipient immunity to tuberculosis. 5. chemoprevention that is, taking rifampicin combined with isoniazid to prevent tuberculosis can be considered in the following situations: 1 infants and young children exposed to open tuberculosis; 2 natural infections with negative neonatal response from negative to positive; 3 strong positive for nodules infants and preschool children; 4 children with positive nodules and early tuberculosis symptoms but normal lung x-ray examination; 5 positive for sputum and concurrent treatment with adrenocortical hormone for other diseases; positive children with measles and whooping cough.the preventive dose is 10mg/(kg{d) for 3 months. chemoprevention can achieve three effects: 1 prevention of active tuberculosis in children; 2 prevention of re-ignition of tuberculosis in adolescence; 3 prevention of extrapulmonary tuberculosis.","corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents often cause occult tuberculosis, such as long-term use of hormones in asthma, long-term use of hormones and immunosuppressive agents in organ transplantation, and surgery and chemotherapy in malignant tumors.these conditions have increased in recent years. for most people, after inhalation of tuberculosis, tuberculosis becomes active if the immune system does not stop the growth of tuberculosis.when tuberculosis becomes active (breeding in your body), this is called tuberculosis.people with tuberculosis are called tuberculosis patients. when the body's resistance is reduced, the tuberculosis bacteria that invade the human body through the respiratory tract or the digestive tract often form a primary lesion in the lung or intestinal wall, and 90 to 95% occur in the lungs. studies have shown that the identical proportion of identical twins with tuberculosis is much higher than that of fraternal twins, which proves that genetic factors have a positive impact on tuberculosis patients.","['herpes', 'blood sputum', 'tuberculosis', 'lymph node tuberculosis', 'breathing difficulties', 'nasal tuberculosis', 'hemoptysis', 'immune deficiency', 'low fever']",['heart disease'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric synthesis']","['anti-tb treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'symptomatic treatment']"
neonatal respiratory distress syndrome,"neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (rdsn), also known as hyaline membrane disease (hmd), indicates progressive dyspnea, cyanosis, expiratory sputum, and inspiratory trigeminal signs soon after birth. and respiratory failure.mainly found in premature infants, especially gestational age less than 32 to 33 weeks.its basic characteristics are progressive immature lung, pulmonary alveolar dysplasia caused by lack of pulmonary surfactant, pulmonary fluid transport disorder, pulmonary capillary-alveolar high permeability exudative lesions.its pathological feature is that a clear membrane of eosin is attached to the wall of the alveolar wall to the terminal bronchioles.respiratory therapy and critical care techniques, which are based on mechanical ventilation and ventilator therapy, have enabled more than 90% of children with rdsn to survive.","first, prenatal prevention refers to the possibility of premature delivery of pregnant women to give adrenal cortical hormone (ach) in the late pregnancy to prevent premature birth of rds or reduce the symptoms of rds, liggins first found intravenous drip in 1969 dexamethasone can promote the maturity of premature sheep lungs, and the same results can be obtained for other heterogeneous lungs. later, it is gradually applied to pregnant women to promote the maturation of lungs in premature infants. the most commonly used hormone is betame-thasone. and dexamethasone (dexamethasone) because they are easier to pass through the placenta into the fetus than other ach, the effect of ach is to stimulate fetal lung type ii cells to produce phospholipids and small protein, reduce the permeability of capillaries in the lungs, reduce pulmonary edema, therefore can reduce the incidence of rds, even if the onset, the symptoms are lighter, can reduce the mortality rate, the oxygen concentration during treatment does not have to be too high, can prevent complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) and post-crystal fibrosis (rop) because of the reduction of hypoxia, it is reasonable to reduce the incidence of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis and hypoxic ischemic intracranial hemorrhage. the preventive dose of ach for pregnant women; 24 mg of betamethasone or dexamethasone, divided into 2 intramuscular injections, 24 hours apart, the commonly used dose in china is 5-10 mg, intramuscular or intravenous drip, once a day for 3 days. prevention should be given 7 to 24 hours before the delivery of the pregnant woman, so that the drug has enough time to play its due role. ach prevention does not increase the possibility of infection for pregnant women and fetuses, even if the amniotic membrane is broken, it will not be based on the original. increasing the infection rate, intrauterine growth retardation is not a contraindication, the effect of preventing rds is very inconsistent for the very low birth weight infants delivered. it is generally considered that the incidence of rds cannot be reduced, but in the infants who have survived the ventricle the incidence of lower cerebral hemorrhage seems to be reduced, and ach is less effective in infants with diabetes, rh hemolytic disease, and multiple pediatric children. although ach prevention has a positive effect, there are still 10% of premature infants with rds. therefore, considering the addition of other hormones to improve the effect, thyroxine has the effect of promoting lung maturation, but it is not clinically applicable because it is not easy to pass the placental barrier. later, it was found that the structure of thyrotropin releasing hormone (trh) in animal brain tissue is similar to that of thyroxine, and can pass through the placenta. it can be used as a prophylactic preparation. the dose is 0.4mg every time, once every 8 hours, a total of 4 times. some pregnant women may have side effects, including va heart, vomiting and high blood pressure, which can be reduced to half. after the addition of trh, the incidence and mortality of rds are lower. second, postpartum prevention refers to the baby's lung surface activity and substances within half an hour after birth to prevent the occurrence of rds or to alleviate its symptoms, mostly used in babies whose prenatal care is not prevented, the sooner the prevention is better, preferably in infants before the start of breathing or before the start of ventilator positive pressure breathing, the ps can be evenly distributed in the lungs. the preventive effect is reflected in the incidence of rds and the mortality rate, and the disease is mild. because ps can improve the oxygenation function in the body early, some babies can use the ventilator, the oxygen concentration and the average airway pressure can be lower, so the incidence of air leakage and oxygen poisoning is significantly reduced, and oxygen can also be reduced. the occurrence of ischemic intracranial hemorrhage, chronic lung disease (cld) is rare. cld refers to the disease that needs oxygen supply within 28 days after birth. although the advantages of prevention are many, premature infants and asphyxia are not rds must occur, prevention of babies who are not ill will increase costs and unnecessary tracheal intubation, and suffocation and premature babies often require more urgent resuscitation, ps prevention will temporarily interrupt recovery continuous process, therefore, premature infants with a birth rate of <28 weeks or a birth weight <1000g in the delivery room, if the antenatal mother does not receive ach prevention, the ps can be prevented by the experienced and skilled resuscitation personnel, while other babies are immediately after the occurrence of rds, the ps was instilled into the ventilator and the tracheal intubation and treated as treatment. ps prevention and ps treatment are not easily separated. many newborns who have just recovered have irregular breathing or distress, and need ps to continue treatment. the amount of prevention is similar to the amount of treatment, such as using natural ps (regardless of pig lung or bovine lung ps). 100 ~ 150mg / kg, such as the use of synthetic exosurf infusion dose of 5ml / kg (containing dppc 67mg / kg). see the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and the third chapter of the third section of pulmonary surfactant and its clinical application overview. third, joint prevention refers to prenatal ach for pregnant women, postpartum for the joint prevention of neonatal ps, for 1 prenatal prevention begins later, pregnant women have not delivered to 24 hours, 2 neonates with severe distress the post-occurrence of rds is also often severe. this is based on joint prevention. animal experiments have shown that combined prevention is better than separate prevention.","when the fetus is 22 to 24 weeks old, the lung type ii cells can produce ps, but the amount is small, and rarely metastasize to the alveolar surface. as the gestational age increases, the synthesis of ps gradually increases, so the baby is born in the lungs earlier. the lower the amount of ps, the higher the incidence of rds. at the age of 24 to 30 weeks, various hormones have the greatest effect on promoting lung maturation. this is the best stage for prenatal prevention. after 32 to 34 weeks, the hormone pair the effect of lung maturation is not very important. after 35 weeks of gestational age, the stage of ps rapidly entering the alveolar surface. the lungs of premature infants continue to develop after birth. the ps produced within 72 to 96 hours after birth can generally maintain normal breathing, so as long as the ps deficiency phase is supplemented so that premature babies can survive the storm and the survival rate can be increased. the blood sugar of pregnant women with diabetes is high, and the blood sugar of the fetus is also increased. at this time, the secretion of fetal insulin must be increased to adapt to the needs of glucose metabolism, and the glucose is converted into glycogen. in this case, the fetus grows fat and huge, but the lungs are not necessarily mature, and insulin antagonizes the action of adrenocortical hormones and affects lung development. the distress in the palace occurs mostly in the fetus with insufficiency of the placenta. due to long-term hypoxia, the development of fetal lungs is low, and the secretion of ps is low. the suffocation at birth is caused by dystocia, which is one of the causes of rds in newborns. the appearance of the lungs is normal. due to the high degree of stagnation, it is dark red. the quality of the lungs is dangerous to sink into the water. the cut surface is dark red lung tissue. under the sumuyi red staining microscope, extensive resorption of atelectasis is seen. the alveolar walls are close to each other. there is only a small amount of dilated alveoli in the lung, and the wall is covered with a layer of eosinophilic homogeneous and unstructured substance, that is, a transparent membrane. sometimes the transparent membrane is partially freed from the alveoli, the alveolar duct and bronchioles are dilated, and the wall is also with a transparent membrane, the lung tissue has edema, sometimes the process of edema fluid is concentrated into a transparent membrane, and large mononuclear and multinucleated cells are seen to exude. those who survive for more than 32 hours often have pneumonia, and the transparent membrane has been absorbed. or loose granular particles. the pathogenesis of ps can reduce the surface tension at the junction of the alveolar wall and the alveolar gas, and make the alveolar open. its half-life is short and needs to be continuously supplemented. when ps is absent, the alveolar surface tension is increased, the alveolar collapses, and the functional residual volume is decreased. the compliance curve moves down, the compliance decreases, the ineffective cavity ventilation, the respiratory work increases significantly, the energy is depleted, leading to systemic organ failure, according to the formula: p (alveolar retraction rate) = 2t (surface tension) / r (alveolar radius). the alveoli with the smallest radius during exhalation collapsed first, so progressive atelectasis occurred. the number of alveolar and aerated area of immature lungs was too small, the alveolar space was wide, gas diffusion and exchange were severely insufficient, and end-expiratory alveolar collapse difficulty in ventilation, hypoxemia, decreased ability of alveolar epithelial cells to synthesize surfactants, leading to clinical exacerbations of dyspnea and cyanosis, persistent hypoxia leading to pulmonary vasospasm, pulmonary hypertension, and reduced pulmonary blood flow right outside the lung, shunt right and left, pulmonary arteriovenous shunt, imbalance of ventilation-perfusion, affecting blood and blood exchange, continuous hypoxia and acidosis can cause myocardial damage, decreased cardiac output, systemic hypotension, low perfusion, finally, multiple organ failure mainly caused by respiratory failure is as follows: insufficient alveolar surfactant L increased alveolar wall surface tension (increased alveolar retraction force) L minimum radius of alveoli first collapse L progressive atelectasis L hypoxia, acidosis L pulmonary arteriolar spasm L increased pulmonary artery pressure L foramen ovale and arterial catheter opening L right to left shunt (continuous fetal circulation) decreased pulmonary perfusion lung tissue hypoxia heavier L L L capillary permeability fibrin calm hyaline membrane formation L L hypoxia, acidosis is more severe, resulting in a vicious cycle. due to the decreased secretion synthesis of lung ps, the blockage of ps recirculation pathway, or due to excessive fluid in the alveolar space (transportation disorder, hyperosmotic), ps can be insufficient, and pathological exudate contains a large amount of plasma protein. interference and inhibition of ps function in the alveolar cavity, inhalation at birth, pneumonia, lung dysplasia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and early hypoxic lesions such as asphyxia may be related to the above pathophysiology, etc., pulmonary intrapulmonary surface activity in preterm infants the total amount of phospholipids in the substance, only 10% to 30% of full-term children, or lower, and lack of major pulmonary surfactant proteins such as sp-a, b, c, etc., are inferior to full-term children in quantity and quality. it is the main reason for the occurrence of rdsn. the application of exogenous pulmonary surfactant preparation can rapidly increase the content of pulmonary surfactant in the lungs. after pulmonary surfactant is instilled into the lungs of children with rdsn, the surface activity of the lungs is activated. the substance phospholipids are immediately taken up by alveolar epithelial cells and gradually enhance the functional activity of endogenous pulmonary surfactants, especially the synthesis and secretion of sp-a, b, c. this process is related to the clinical response after administration. owned by closely related.","['face cyanosis', 'newborn cyanosis', 'breathing difficulty', 'breathing sound weakened', 'mouth around mouth and mouth', 'acute dyspnea', 'nose wing fan',

inhalation injury,"inhalation injury refers to the chemical damage caused by inhaling toxic fumes or chemicals to the respiratory tract. in severe cases, the lung parenchyma can be directly damaged.it occurs mostly in large areas, especially in patients with head and face burns.inhalation injury is related to the environment in which the injury occurs.it often occurs in an environment that is not ventilated or sealed, especially in an explosive atmosphere. in this environment, the concentration of the hot flame is high, the temperature is high, and it is not easy to spread rapidly. the patient cannot immediately leave the fire source; in addition, in a confined space, the combustion is incomplete, resulting in a large amount of carbon monoxide and other toxic gases make patients toxic and coma, and suffocate and die.when combined with explosive combustion, high temperature, high pressure, high flow rate of air and thick toxic gases can cause damage to the deep respiratory tract and lung parenchyma.in addition, the patient stands or rushes to shout, causing the heat to inhale, which is also one of the causes of injury.","the main method is to prevent disasters. in addition, special workers should have escape skills in dangerous situations such as fires.in patients with inhalation injury, infections need to be prevented. prevention and treatment of infection: after inhalation injury, due to airway and lung damage, cilia function is destroyed, airway secretions and foreign bodies can not be discharged in time, local and systemic resistance is reduced, etc., often cause airway and lung infection, once infected if the treatment is not timely, it can be complicated by acute respiratory failure and become an important lesion of systemic infection, which induces sepsis. thoroughly remove foreign bodies in the airway and exfoliated necrotic mucosa, and circulate smoothly, which is the basic measure for prevention and treatment of infection, followed by strict aseptic technique and disinfection and isolation, strictly control wound-pulmonary-wound bacterial cross infection; regular airway secretion smear and culture, use sensitive antibiotics, in addition, systemic support therapy should be strengthened to improve the body's immune function, which is reasonable for prevention and treatment of infection.","the main cause of inhalation injury is thermal action, but at the same time, a large amount of unburned smog, carbon particles, and irritating chemicals are also inhaled, which also damages the respiratory tract and alveoli. therefore, inhalation damage is a mixed damage of heat and chemicals. inhalation injury is related to the environment in which the injury occurs. it often occurs in an environment that is not ventilated or sealed, especially when it is exploded. in this environment, the concentration of hot flame is high, the temperature is high, and it is not easy to spread quickly. the patient cannot immediately leave the fire; in addition, in a confined space, the combustion is incomplete, resulting in a large amount of carbon monoxide and other toxic gases make patients toxic and coma, and suffocate and die. when combined with explosive combustion, high temperature, high pressure, high flow rate of air and thick toxic gases can cause damage to the deep respiratory tract and lung parenchyma. in addition, the patient stands or rushes to shout, causing the heat to inhale, which is also one of the causes of injury. 1. the direct damage thermaldamage to the respiratory tractincludes dry heat and moist heat. flames and hot air are dry heat, and hot steam is hot and humid. when inhaling hot air, the vocal cords can be reflectively closed, while the heat transfer capacity of the dry hot air is poor. the upper airway has a water-heat exchange function, which can absorb a large amount of heat to cool it; the dry hot air reaches the bronchial bifurcation at the time of the department, the temperature can be reduced to 1/5 to 1/10 of the original. therefore, dry heat often causes damage to the upper respiratory tract. the hot and humid air is about 2000 times larger than the heat capacity of dry hot air, and the conduction capacity is about 4000 times larger than that of dry air, and the heat dissipation is slow. therefore, in addition to causing upper respiratory tract damage and tracheal damage, moist heat can also cause damage to the bronchi and lung parenchyma. 2. damage to the respiratory tract by harmful substances in addition to particles in the inhalation of smoke, there are a large number of harmful substances, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen cyanide, aldehydes, ketones and the like. these substances can cause direct damage to the respiratory tract through thermal action. toxic gases can irritate the throat and bronchospasm and cause chemical damage to the respiratory tract. water-soluble substances such as ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide and the like are synthesized with water as an acid or a base, which can cause chemical burns. nitride reacts with water and salt on the respiratory mucosa to form nitric acid and nitrite. the former directly corrodes the respiratory tract, and the latter absorbs with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, which causes tissue hypoxia. hydrogen cyanide can cause cytochrome oxidase to lose oxygen and inhibit intracellular respiration. aldehydes can reduce cilia activity, reduce the activity of alveolar macrophages, and damage capillary blood vessels and cause pulmonary edema. the acrolein content of the smoke produced by the combustion of polyurethane is about 50ppm. chemical respiratory damage and pulmonary edema can occur when inhaled with 5.5ppm of acrolein, and 10ppm will cause death within a few minutes. hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide are additive. when the temperature is raised to 1000 ～c, the polyurethane foam decomposes to produce a large amount of hydrogen cyanide. when the concentration of cyanide in the serum reaches 100 米mol/l, it can cause death. when carbon monoxide is inhaled in the smoke, it will cause people to be poisoned by carbon monoxide, and the heavy ones may die on the spot. when inhaled air containing 5% carbon monoxide, it can cause poisoning. the toxic effects are as follows: ( 1) the combination of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin forms a dissociation of carboxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, which is equivalent to 1/3600 of the dissociation rate of oxyhemoglobin, and the affinity of carbon monoxide with blood albumin is 200-300 times greater than that of oxygen. therefore, blood oxygenation dysfunction, resulting in systemic tissue hypoxia.

(3) carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to reduce oxygen transport in tissues. in addition, in the event of fire, the simultaneous production of high concentrations of carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide can aggravate the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning and aggravate tissue hypoxia.","['moderate inhalation injury', 'mucosal congestion', 'grande silver', 'heart rate increase', 'breathing difficulty', 'wandering sound', 'breathing block', 'breathing low', 'tracheal tract sudden damage above, 'breathing sound weakened', 'throat edema']",['septicemia'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
pediatric staphylococcus aureus pneumonia,"staphylococcus aureus pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by staphylococcus aureus. because children, especially newborns, have immune dysfunction, they are more common in young babies and newborns. older children can also occur. they are invaded by the respiratory tract. or the blood line spreads the human lungs.staphylococcus aureus is highly pathogenic and produces a variety of toxins and enzymes, including exotoxin, leukocidin, enterotoxin, epidermal exfoliating and plasma coagulase, hyaluronidase, and deoxyribonuclease. wait.staphylococcus aureus pneumonia occurs in the subpleural tissue, characterized by extensive hemorrhagic necrosis and multiple abscess formation. it is the lung necrosis around the bronchioles and the purulent secretions block the bronchioles and become a valve-like blockage. pulmonary bullae, adjacent to the pleural abscess, empyema, pneumothorax or pneumothorax.inflammation easily spreads to other parts, such as pericardium, brain, liver, etc., causing migratory suppuration.the child has an acute onset, serious illness, rapid development, high fever, obvious symptoms of poisoning, pale complexion, cough, phlegm, difficulty breathing, early signs of lungs, and both lungs can smell medium and fine wet rales. combine circulation, nerves and maintain dysfunction.the disease is prone to complications, and due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains, treatment is also more difficult, and the disease can occur throughout the year, mostly in winter and spring.","1. enhancing physical fitness and improving your own immunity is an effective way to prevent pneumonia. 2. vaccine pneumococcal vaccination is injected subcutaneously on the lateral side of the upper arm, only once (0.5 ml), the protection period can be more than 5 years. after vaccination, a small number of people can have slight swelling and pain in the injection, very few people ( less than 1%) can occur with low heat and can be recovered within 2 to 3 days. 3. it is necessary to pay attention to the hygiene and cleaning of the room of the child care institution, and should promptly check whether the staff is carrying the bacteria, and the carrier should promptly handle it properly.","(a) the cause of the disease staphylococcus can produce a variety of toxins and enzymes, such as hemolysin, staphylokinase, coagulase, etc., it is generally believed that coagulase has a certain relationship with bacterial toxicity, such as coagulase negative (such as staphylococcus epidermidis), it is mostly a conditional pathogen and rarely causes serious diseases, but it is one of the common bacteria in hospital infections. in children, especially neonatal immune dysfunction is an important susceptibility factor for staphylococcus aureus infection. foreign studies have shown underweight and gestational age are two high-risk factors for sepsis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci cannot be ignored in neonatal blood culture. pathogens enter the body from the body surface or mucous membranes. due to the action of the above toxins and enzymes, it is not easy to be killed, and spreads with the blood circulation to the whole body, the lungs are easily involved, there are other migratory lesions, and the lungs can be directly affected by the respiratory tract infection. (b) the pathogenesis of staphylococcus aureus has a strong virulence, can produce hemolytic toxin, plasma coagulase, deoxyribonuclease, leukocidin, staphylococcus aureus pneumonia occurs in the subpleural tissue, to a wide range the hemorrhagic necrosis and the formation of multiple abscesses, the necrosis of the bronchioles and the surrounding alveoli make the gas in the airway enter the interstitial lung and alveolar around the necrotic area, and the purulent secretions fill the bronchioles, becoming a flap-like blockage. the tension is gradually increased to form a bullous bullae (lung balloon swelling), and the abscess adjacent to the pleura is ruptured with empyema, pneumothorax or pneumothorax. pathological changes of primary bronchopneumonia caused by staphylococcus aureus, characterized by extensive hemorrhagic necrosis, multiple small abscesses, the pleural surface of the lung is covered with a thick layer of fibrinous purulent secretion, abscess staphylococcus aureus, white blood cells, red blood cells and necrotic tissue fragments, subpleural small abscess rupture, the formation of empyema or pus pneumothorax, sometimes can erode the bronchial bronchial pleural effusion, if secondary to sepsis, in addition to lung abscess abscess can occur in other organs such as subcutaneous tissue, bone marrow, heart, kidney, adrenal gland and brain.","['sleepiness', 'scarlet fever-like rash', 'diarrhea', 'irritability', 'low fever', 'embry chest', 'bloated', 'breathing weakened']",['septicemia'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
pediatric acute bronchitis,"acute bronchitis (acutebronchitis) is caused by inflammation of the bronchial mucosa caused by various pathogens.often secondary to upper respiratory tract infections, or a clinical manifestation of acute infectious diseases.the trachea is often involved at the same time, so it is also called acute tracheobronchitis.infants and young children are more common, and the symptoms are heavier.mainly caused by infection, the pathogen is various viruses, bacteria, mycoplasma pneumoniae, or mixed infection.most of them have upper respiratory symptoms first, followed by cough as the main symptom, starting with a dry cough, and later there are convulsions.infants and young children have severe symptoms.generally no systemic symptoms.","prevention 1. strengthen physical exercise and enhance disease resistance. 2, pay attention to cold adjustment, to prevent cold, especially in autumn and winter, pay special attention to the chest to keep warm. 3, for repeated authors can prevent drugs, such as jaundice daily 6-9 grams for 2-3 months, can also be used to prevent recurrence.","mycoplasma pneumoniae or bacteria, or a combination of infections, virus infection, influenza, adenovirus, type 3 parainfluenza and respiratory fusion virus, etc., m. pneumoniae is not uncommon, any virus that can cause upper respiratory tract infection can be become a pathogen of bronchitis. on the basis of viral infection, pathogenic bacteria can cause secondary infection. the more common bacteria are pneumococci, 汕-hemolytic streptococcus group a, staphylococcus and influenza bacilli, and sometimes pertussis. salmonella or diphtheria. often secondary to medical and surgical reasons such as chronic diarrhea, short bowel syndrome and malabsorption.the non-medical reasons for malnutrition are poor eating habits, lack of nutritional knowledge, and parents neglecting scientific feeding methods.for malnourished people, it is usually possible to treat the primary disease, provide an appropriate diet, educate the parents and follow up carefully. rickets, allergies, and chronic rhinitis and pharyngitis can all be the cause of this disease.","['wet voice', 'fatigue', 'bacterial infection', 'chest pain', 'diarrhea', 'twirl pronunciation', 'abdominal pain']",['otitis media'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']",['anti-infective and antitussive and anti-asthmatic symptoms and supportive treatment']
pediatric influenza,"influenza (abbreviated as flu) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza virus. it is also a highly contagious disease with a rapid spread. it is often endemic.it is mainly spread by droplets, contact between people or contact with contaminated objects.the main clinical manifestations are acute high fever, headache, body aches, fatigue and mild respiratory symptoms.from clinical manifestations can be divided into several types: simple influenza, pneumonia-type influenza, poisoning influenza, gastrointestinal influenza.the course of influenza is self-limiting. patients with no complications usually recover within 5-10 days. severe cases occur mostly in infants and the elderly, and are complicated by pulmonary infection. the prevention and treatment work cannot be ignored.","1. pay attention to the younger therest of thebaby, the more need to rest and care, resume the activity after the symptoms disappear, so as not to relapse due to the failure of the lesion. for those with fever, it is best to rest in bed to reduce the stimulation of the central nervous system. 2. reasonable diet the baby with cold and fever is prone to loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. dietary care is very important. the general principle is to choose digestible food and eat less. if you insist on eating your baby, it will cause your baby's gastrointestinal burden to be heavy, which is harmful to your body and disease recovery. you can eat less food each time, eat more times, and give your baby some fruit juice, such as fresh orange juice. a baby with a fever and a good digestion ability can be thicker. as the baby's condition improves, it usually returns to a normal diet in about 1 week. 3. the environment is suitable to keep the baby's room air circulation. for hot babies, fresh air helps the skin to sweat effectively and lowers body temperature. should avoid direct blowing on the baby, resulting in the baby's skin vasoconstriction, aggravating the condition. arrange a good rest environment for the baby, keep the room quiet, do not speak loudly, increase the baby's sleep time as much as possible to reduce energy consumption. you can let your baby lie in bed, tell the baby a soft story or listen to music, help the baby to relax, and promote the recovery of the disease. 4. effective sweating encourages your baby to drink more water. water can increase the body's cellular metabolism, promote the discharge of toxins in the body, and at the same time effectively sweat, which is beneficial to lowering body temperature. don't over-thick your baby's clothes and bedding. wear loose pants for effective sweating and heat dissipation. do not give the baby a lot of clothes and cover the thick bedding, otherwise it will lead to high fever, and even induce febrile seizures! after taking the antipyretics, the baby will sweat a lot, and the clothes should be replaced after being wet. suffering from the cold and aggravating the condition. 5. physical cooling of children with influenza drugs baby fever should be the preferred physical cooling, especially for small babies. when the physical cooling is invalid, use a small amount of antipyretics to cool the drug. physical cooling methods include: local heat dissipation, warm bath or warm water bath, cold salt water enema, etc. among them, the local heat dissipation method is the easiest and most convenient, suitable for families. local heat sinking method head cold wet pack or head ice pack: this is the most common method. the cold and wet compress of the head (that is, the cold wipes applied to the baby's forehead) is the most accepted. some babies do not want to put the ice pack on their heads, and they can be applied with cold wipes. care should be taken to replace the ice pack or cold wipes frequently. ice packs in the neck, underarms, and groin: these areas have larger blood vessels, and it is better to place the ice packs in these places. warm bath or warm water bath: it can receive good cooling effect, but it is difficult to implement in winter. experts remind: to closely observe the changes in the baby's condition, pay attention to the horror of the fever, and watch out for the occurrence of febrile seizures. a baby who has had a fever and convulsions should take ""lumina"" under the guidance of a doctor to prevent recurrence of febrile seizures. if you find a baby with a herpes in your mouth or a rash on your skin, you should see your doctor promptly.","80% to 90% of the colds are caused by viruses, and there are more than 200 kinds of viruses that can cause colds; 10% to 20% of the colds are caused by bacteria.infants under the age of 1 are more likely to have a cold because the immune system is not yet mature. children are prone to catch a cold, first of all related to their physiological and anatomical features, and the immature immune system.the child's nasal cavity is narrow, the mucous membrane is soft, the mucosal gland is insufficiently secreted, it is dry, and it is poorly adapted and resistant to the external environment, and it is prone to inflammation.premature infants, children with congenital defects or diseases, such as cardiopulmonary insufficiency, especially those with congenital immune diseases, may have a cold when they take care of a slight mistake. secondly, it is also related to the improper feeding of parents. because of the rapid growth of children, children who are artificially fed due to lack of breast milk, and children who are too pampered, partial eclipse or anorexia, malnutrition or imbalance may cause different degrees of iron deficiency. lack of calcium or insufficient intake of vitamins and proteins.nutrients such as iron, zinc and protein play an important role in the synthesis of various globulins of the immune system and in promoting the maturation and differentiation of immune cells, affecting the resistance of the child's body. third, it is related to poor surroundings.some children have poor family room conditions, dark and humid; some indoor temperatures are too much or too low; some families like to close the doors and windows all day long, the air is not circulating; some family members like to smoke, plus the same room fire, smoke pollution serious.poor environment, turbid air, and great harm to the respiratory tract are important causes of colds.some parents dress too much or too little for their children. the result is not sweating or cold, it is easy to induce a cold. finally, the cold is also associated with a lack of outdoor exercise.due to objective conditions or insufficient attention, many children lack outdoor activities.for example, in northern china and in areas with long cold seasons, children spend most of their time indoors and rarely have the opportunity to be outdoors; some parents love children and keep their children in air-conditioned rooms.once these children are cold, they can't adapt and are prone to colds.","['children's stuffy nose', 'children have a red spot after fever"", 'sickness', 'sleepiness', 'runny nose', 'dizziness', 'fear of cold', 'rale']",['otitis media'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'symptomatic support comprehensive treatment']"

(1) strengthening outdoor activities in peacetime, seeing more sunshine, enhancing physical fitness, improving disease resistance, timely treatment of anemia in children, malnutrition, and rickets. (2) pay attention to climate change, increase or decrease clothes in time, avoid cold and heat, and maintain proper room temperature and indoor window ventilation. (3) during the epidemic, try to reduce the number of outings to prevent infection. (4) life should be regular, diet is regular, daily life is normal, night sleep early, avoid cold, avoid convection when sleeping.

silicosis,"silicosis, also known as silicosis, is one of the most common types of pneumoconiosis. it is caused by a large amount of nodular fibrosis in the lungs caused by long-term inhalation of a large amount of free silica dust.severe cases can affect lung function, loss of labor capacity, and even develop into pulmonary heart disease, heart failure and respiratory failure.the disease is more common in miners, especially excavation workers, and a large number of dust, quartz, ceramics and refractory materials, the incidence of the disease is generally slow, generally 5 to 10 years, the elderly can reach 20 years.","the patients have a close history of contact with dust and a detailed occupational history, causing a lot of work for silicosis, and long-term exposure to workers of various metals, coal powder, refractory materials, stone powder, cement, glass, ceramics and other types of work. 1. control or reduce the incidence of silicosis, the key is dust.industrial and mining enterprises should grasp comprehensive dust prevention measures such as reforming production technology, wet operation, closed dust source, ventilation and dust removal, equipment maintenance and repair. 2. strengthen personal protection and comply with dustproof operating procedures.regularly monitor the dust concentration in the air in the production environment and strengthen publicity and education.do a good physical examination before employment, including x-ray. 3. anyone with active pulmonary tuberculosis and various respiratory diseases should not participate in the work of dusting.regular physical examinations of dust workers, including x-ray films, are performed, and the interval between examinations depends on the amount of silica contacted and the concentration of airborne dust. 4. strengthen the prevention and control of tuberculosis in industrial and mining areas.those who are negative for tuberculin test should be vaccinated with bcg; positive for preventive anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy to reduce the incidence of silicosis and tuberculosis. 5. comprehensive measures should be taken for silicosis patients, including dust-free operations, and appropriate work should be arranged to strengthen nutrition and proper rehabilitation exercises to enhance physical fitness.prevent the occurrence of respiratory infections and combined symptoms.","cause 1. the content of free sio2in the dust concentrationin theair ishigher in the ambient dust. the higher the dust concentration, the greater the damage. the dust concentration is expressed in mg/m3. when the content of free sio2 in the dust is large and the concentration is high (tens or even hundreds of mg/m3), the sputum nodules are formed in the lung tissue after long-term inhalation. 2. contact time the development of silicosis is a chronic process, usually in the continuous inhalation of dust for 5 to 10 years, some for 5 to 20 years. however, continuous inhalation of high concentration, high free silica content of dust, can occur after 1 to 2 years, known as ""quick hair silicosis."" 3. dust dispersion dispersion is a measure of the size of the dust particles and is expressed as a percentage of the composition of the various particle diameters in the dust. the larger the proportion of small particle dust, the greater the dispersion. the degree of dispersion is closely related to the floating of dust particles in the air and its retention in the respiratory tract. dust particles larger than 10um in diameter quickly settle in the air, even if inhaled, they are retained by the nasal nasal hair and discharged with the sputum; most of the dust below 10um is blocked by the upper respiratory tract; dust below 5um can enter the alveoli; dust below 0.5um, due to its small gravity, is not easy to settle, and discharges with exhalation, so the retention rate decreases; while the dust below <0.1um increases the retention rate due to brownian motion. 4. body state the human respiratory tract has a series of defensive devices. the inhaled dust first passes through the nasal cavity, and is blocked by the dust filtering effect of the nose hair and the nasal septum, generally 30% to 50% of the amount of inhaled dust; entering the trachea and bronchi the dust can be largely blocked by the bifurcation of the bronchial tree and the movement of the mucous epithelial cilia and discharged with the sputum; some of the dust particles are phagocytized by macrophages or alveolar interstitial macrophages into dust cells, dust cells or unphagocytic. free dust particles can enter the hilar lymph nodes along the lymphatic vessels. anyone with chronic respiratory inflammation, the respiratory function of the respiratory tract is poor, respiratory infections, especially tuberculosis, can promote the rapid progress and aggravation of the disease. in addition, individual factors such as age, health quality, personal hygiene habits, nutritional status, etc. are also important conditions affecting the incidence of silicosis. pathogenesis after the free silica particles enter the alveoli, they are engulfed by pulmonary macrophages that accumulate at the beginning of the lymphatic vessels of the lung. the free silica has a strong toxic effect on macrophages, which can cause autolysis and death. after being phagocytosed, silicon is encapsulated in phagocytic lysosomes, which form hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups on the quartz surface and the hydrogen atom receptors (oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur atoms) on the macrophage lysosomal membrane lipoprotein structure. causes changes in cell membrane and changes in permeability, leading to macrophage lysosomal disintegration, and release of acidic hydrolase into the cell, which in turn leads to the death of macrophages, and releases the quartz particles again, forming a vicious circle, resulting in a vicious circle. more cell damage, damaged macrophages release non-lipid ""fibrotic factors"", stimulate fibroblasts, leading to collagen fibrosis, forming a focal nodule centered on collagen fibers - sputum nodules the sacral nodules spread to the whole lung and merged with each other, causing diffuse damage to both lungs. fibrosis is not limited to the lungs, but also exists in the lymph nodes to which macrophages migrate, in many silicosis patients. it is found that the serum 污-globulin level is increased, the presence of autoantibodies, and the presence of 污-globulin in silicosis, so the immunological mechanism of silicosis is proposed, but the immune components do not appear to be involved in the killing and fibrosis of macrophages. formation, and therefore a secondary pathogenesis. the sacral nodule is a characteristic lesion of silicosis, accompanied by diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. the sacral nodule is usually located around the bronchus and blood vessels, with a diameter of 0.3-1.5 mm. the gross specimen is gray-brown with a hard texture. the volume is increased, the weight is increased, the surface is sandy or hard, and the section can be seen with nodules or lumps of different sizes. the boundary is clear and the texture is dense. there is emphysema in the lung tissue around the nodules. usually the whole lung is diffuse. distribution, local lymph nodes in the pleura and outside are often involved, calcification or formation of tendon nodules. under the microscope, the sacral nodules are round or star-shaped, and the center is composed of collagen fibers that have undergone hyaline degeneration. the collagen fibers are arranged in concentric circles. there are different proportions of reticular fibers around the nodules, macrophages, and fibrils. the cells and plasma cells are surrounded by halo, the halo is larger, and the lesion is more active. the polarized light microscopy can identify the quartz particles in the sacral nodules and deposited in the lung tissue. the hilar lymph node is the earliest part of the sputum reaction. it can enlarge the lymph nodes before the sacral nodules are seen on the chest radiograph. the gross specimens can be seen with lymphadenopathy, adhesions, histological findings similar to the lungs, and visible in the lymph nodes. scattered non-necrotic granulomas, with fibrotic changes as the lesion progresses, lymph node lesions may be more important than lung tissue changes in typical tendon nodules and severe interstitial fibrosis.","['chest pain', 'barrel chest', 'breathing difficulty', 'appetite loss', 'pulmonary fibrosis', 'exhalation sound extension', 'qi short', 'breathing sound weakened', 'qi rush', 'rale']","['chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'chronic pulmonary heart disease', 'emphysema', 'spontaneous pneumothorax', 'hemoptysis']","['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
neonatal asphyxia,"asphyxiaof newborn refers to the occurrence of intrauterine distress or respiratory and circulatory disturbance during fetal delivery due to various causes of prenatal, intrapartum or postpartum, resulting in no hypoxia or spontaneous breathing within 1 min after birth. failure to establish regular breathing, with hypoxemia, hypercapnia and acidosis as the main pathophysiological changes.severe asphyxia is one of the important causes of disability and death in newborns.the motherland medicine said that neonatal asphyxia is a suffocation of the newborn, a sudden death of the baby, a suffocating suffocation, a dream, and a grass fan.","1. perinatal health care: strengthen perinatal care and timely treatment of high-risk pregnancy. 2. fetal monitoring: strengthen fetal monitoring, avoid and timely correct intrauterine hypoxia, for intrauterine hypoxic fetus, can understand the degree of meconium-stained amniotic fluid through amniocentesis, or take fetal scalp blood when the fetal head is exposed to the cervix blood gas analysis to estimate the degree of intrauterine hypoxia, pg and sp-a are low near birth, or l/s, pg, sp-a are very low, the risk of rds is very high, and measures must be taken actively. 3. avoid dystocia: closely monitor pregnant women in labor and avoid dystocia. 4. proficiency in resuscitation techniques: training the delivery personnel to master the resuscitation technique. 5. equipped with resuscitation equipment: resuscitation equipment should be equipped in the hospital delivery room. persons with mastery of resuscitation techniques must be present during high-risk pregnancy delivery. care should be taken during clinical resuscitation. before the airway is cleaned (especially meconium-contaminated children), avoid irritation. the newborn makes it cry so that the inhalation in the airway is not further inhaled into the lungs.","the essence of suffocation is hypoxia. any factor that can cause the decrease of blood oxygen concentration in the fetus or newborn can cause asphyxia. one cause can affect the body through different ways, and multiple causes can also act simultaneously. the neonatal asphyxia is mostly prenatal. or due to factors of birth, postpartum factors are less, common causes are as follows: (1) pregnant mothers hypoxic diseases: such as respiratory failure, cyanotic congenital heart disease, severe anemia and co poisoning. (2) diseases of placental circulation disorders: such as congestive heart failure, pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome, chronic nephritis, blood loss, shock, diabetes and infectious diseases. (3) others: pregnant mother drug use, smoking or passive smoking, or pregnant mother age ≡ 35 years old, <16 years old and multiple pregnancy, such as the incidence of fetal asphyxia. (1) premature delivery: premature infants, small for gestational age, giant children, etc. (2) malformations: various deformities such as posterior nostril atresia, throat, lung insufficiency, congenital heart disease and damage to the nervous system caused by intrauterine infection. (3) airway obstruction: meconium inhalation causes obstruction of the airway. such as placenta previa, placental abruption and placental insufficiency. if the umbilical cord is compressed, too short, too long to around the neck or around the body, prolapse, torsion or knotting. such as dystocia, high position forceps, breech position, fetal head suction is not smooth; anesthesia, analgesics and oxytocin used improperly during labor. pathogenesis due to various causes of asphyxia, there are a series of pathophysiological changes: 1. cell damage and hypoxia after asphyxia can lead to cell metabolism and dysfunction and structural abnormalities, and even death, is the evolution of cell damage from reversible to irreversible different cells have different susceptibility to hypoxia, with brain cells being the most sensitive, followed by myocardium, liver and adrenal cells, while fibers, epithelial and skeletal muscle cells are more tolerant to hypoxia. (1) reversible cell damage: the energy required by cells is mainly supplied by atp produced by mitochondria. the lack of oxygen is firstly caused by cellular aerobic metabolism, ie, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which reduces or even stops atp production. oxygen, leading to cellular metabolism, functional and morphological abnormalities: 1 glucose anaerobic glycolysis enhanced: anaerobic glycolysis increased glucose and glycogen consumption, prone to hypoglycemia; also increased lactic acid, causing metabolic acidosis. 2 cell edema: due to lack of energy, the sodium pump actively transports the barrier, allowing sodium and water to remain. 3 calcium into the cell flow: due to the calcium pump active transport barrier, the calcium flow into the cell increased. 4 nuclear protein shedding: due to the detachment of nuclear proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the synthesis of proteins and enzymes is reduced. if the blood flow perfusion and oxygen supply can be restored at this stage, the above changes can be completely restored, generally leaving no sequelae. (2) irreversible cell damage: prolonged or severe hypoxia, will lead to irreversible cell damage. 1 severe mitochondrial morphology and dysfunction: oxidative phosphorylation is not possible, atp is impaired, and mitochondrial capacity is interrupted. 2 cell membrane severe damage: loss of its barrier and transport function. 3 lysosomal rupture: due to lysosomal membrane damage, lysosomal enzymes diffuse into the cytoplasm and digest various components in the cell (autolysis). even if blood flow perfusion and oxygen supply are restored at this stage, the above changes cannot be completely restored. survivors often left different degrees of sequelae. (3) blood flow reperfusion injury: after resuscitation, blood flow reperfusion can lead to intracellular calcium overload and oxygen free radicals, causing further damage to the cells. 2. asphyxia development process (1) primary apnea (primary apnea): when hypoxia, hypercapnia and acidosis occur in the fetus or newborn, the secretion of catecholamines increases, the breathing and heart rate increase, the body redistribution of blood flow, ie selective vasoconstriction, reduces blood flow to secondary tissues and organs such as lungs, intestines, kidneys, muscles, skin, etc., while blood flow to major vital organs such as the brain, heart muscle, and adrenal glands increases, and blood pressure increases. increased cardiac output, such as hypoxemia and acidosis persist, respiratory arrest occurs, called primary apnea. (2) secondary apnea: if the cause is not relieved, hypoxemia persists, blood flow to the lungs, intestines, kidneys, muscles and skin is severely reduced, and blood flow to the brain, heart muscle and adrenal glands is also reduced. can cause damage to the function and morphology of various organs of the body, such as brain and myocardial damage, shock, stress ulcers, etc., after the primary apnea, several respiratory breaths occur, followed by respiratory arrest, the so-called secondary apnea. both types of apnea have no respiratory and heart rate below 100 beats/min, so it is difficult to identify clinically. in order not to delay the rescue time, those who have no breathing after birth should be identified and treated according to secondary apnea. 3. blood biochemical and metabolic changes after asphyxia in the asphyxiating stress state, the release of catecholamines and glucagon increases, making early blood glucose normal or increase; when hypoxia continues, the use of sugar increases, glycogen storage is empty, hypoglycemia occurs increased blood free fatty acids promote calcium-protein binding to hypocalcemia. in addition, acidosis inhibits the binding of bilirubin to albumin, reduces the activity of enzymes in the liver and causes high indirect bilirubinemia; increased atrial natriuretic peptide secretion, resulting in hyponatremia and so on.","['after birth, ""four concave signs""', 'newborn cyanosis', 'breathing inhibition', 'neonatal convulsions', 'arrhythmia', 'wheeze', 'breathing slow', 'neonatal heart failure', 'newborn hairpin']",['pneumothorax'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(ii) pathogenesis mycoplasma pneumoniae is transmitted by droplets and invades the mucosa of the respiratory tract. through its special structure, it is closely adsorbed to the receptor of the cell membrane of the susceptible host, and it proliferates and releases toxic substances such as hydrogen peroxide. enzymes, membrane lipids, etc., cause tissue damage, the basic pathological changes are interstitial pneumonia and acute bronchiolitis, microscopic local mucosal tissue congestion, edema, thickening, cell membrane damage, epithelial cell ciliary movement disappears, single nuclear cells and plasma cells infiltrate, and neutrophils and necrotic epithelial cells are seen in the bronchioles.","['chest pain', 'sore pain', 'pleural effusion', 'pericarditis', 'fear of cold', 'low fever', 'nausea', 'breathing sound weakened', 'anorexia']",['acute heart failure'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['symptomatic treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
neonatal atelectasis,"strictly speaking, atelectasis should indicate that the lungs have never filled the gas after birth, and the de-aeration of the already inflated lung tissue should be called pulmonary collapse.however, due to years of habits, generalized atelectasis can include congenital atelectasis and acquired lung collapse.the most common clinical atelectasis is the complication of infectious pneumonia, or the obstruction of sputum.in the treatment, the back care should be strengthened to promote the absorption of sputum, and bronchial irrigation can also be performed.","specific preventive measures: use a tracheal tube that is slightly thinner than a sealed airbag; intratracheal irrigation and intra-tracheal temperature and humidification; strengthen chest physical therapy; mechanical ventilation plus peep to prevent end-expiratory alveolar collapse; , before and after extubation (intravenous bolus dexamethasone, sucking, atomizing, flapping back, turning over).","(1) thoracic dyskinesia: abnormalities in nerves, muscles and bones, such as cerebral palsy, polio, polyneuritis, spinal muscular atrophy, myasthenia gravis and skeletal deformities (rickets, funnel chest, scoliosis) wait. (2) diaphragmatic dyskinesia: due to paralysis of the phrenic nerve or increased intra-abdominal pressure, often caused by a large number of ascites caused by various reasons. (3) lung expansion is limited: due to negative pressure or increased pressure in the thoracic cavity, such as pleural effusion, gas accumulation, empyema, hemothorax, chylothorax, tension pneumothorax, sputum, tumor and heart enlargement. (4) bronchial compression by external force: due to enlarged lymph nodes, tumor or cyst compression, bronchial lumen blockage, air can not enter the lung tissue, enlarged left atrium and pulmonary artery can compress left common bronchus leading to left atelectasis. (1) foreign body: foreign body block bronchus or bronchioles cause lobary or segmental atelectasis, occasional foreign body block the trachea or main bronchus caused by bilateral or one side of atelectasis. (2) bronchial lesions: bronchial submucosal tuberculosis, tuberculosis granulation tissue, diphtheria pseudomembrane and trachea and bronchus. (3) bronchial wall sputum and viscous secretions in the lumen: the baby's respiratory tract is narrow, easy to be blocked, suffering from pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, whooping cough, measles, etc., and bronchial asthma, bronchial mucosa swelling, smooth muscle spasm, viscous secretions can block the respiratory tract and cause atelectasis. such causes are more common in winter and spring. therefore, the incidence of atelectasis is also more in the cold season. cough medicines such as opioids and atropine can reduce the natural coughing, which can thicken the secretions, can increase obstruction, so it can not be abused. when poliomyelitis or other causes of diaphragm and chest muscle tension is low or even paralyzed, bronchial secretions are not easy to cough up, in the case of chest surgery for a long period of general anesthesia, deep anesthesia or traumatic shock, bronchial due to stimulation hey, the bronchial secretions have been increased, such as cough reflexes are inhibited or disappeared, secretions are more likely to block the lumen, causing atelectasis. bronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonia and bronchial asthma often cause obstruction of most bronchioles. the initial manifestation is obstructive emphysema, followed by partial obstruction, which forms atelectasis and coexist with emphysema. according to the results of direct examination by bronchoscopy, the formation of obstructive atelectasis can be elucidated. (1) surfactant deficiency: pulmonary surfactant is produced by type ii alveolar epithelial cells and is a phospholipid protein complex. the main function is di-brownoyl lecithin, and the surfactant is coated on the alveoli. the inner surface has the function of lowering the surface tension of the air-liquid interface of the alveoli, and has the function of stabilizing the alveolar to prevent alveolar collapse. if the surface active substance is lacking, the surface tension of the alveoli is increased, the alveolar retractive force is increased, and the alveoli is collapsed, resulting in many places with micro-infarction (microatelectasis), pulmonary surfactant deficiency can be seen in: 1 premature infants with immature lung development. 2 bronchial pneumonia, especially viral pneumonia, reduces the production of surfactants. 3 injury, shock and other initial hyperventilation, rapid consumption of surface active substances. 4 inhalation of toxic gas or pulmonary edema may destroy and denature the surfactant. the surface tension of normal lung is 6 dynes/cm. when the surfactant is deficient, the surface tension of infants with respiratory distress may reach 23 dynes/cm. (2) another type of non-obstructive atelectasis may be related to the neuromuscular structure of the terminal airway of the lung: many scholars have confirmed that there is a muscle elastic fiber in the alveolar duct and alveolar sac, which is interwoven with smooth muscle and elastic fibers. together, controlled by autonomic nerves, when severe pain such as rib fractures and surgery, or when the bronchi is strongly stimulated, such as bronchography, contraction of muscle elastic fibers can cause atelectasis, especially large lung collapse. (3) too shallow breathing: such as after surgery and application of morphine, or coma and extremely debilitated patients can see superficial breathing, when the pressure in the lungs is reduced to not enough to resist local surface tension, it can gradually cause alveolar closure and lung zhang, encourage deep breathing of the patient after surgery to prevent the alveoli from closing, or to reopen the alveoli that is closed due to shallow breathing. in short, the incidence of atelectasis in children is higher, the cause is bronchiolitis, bronchitis, asthma, bronchial lymph node tuberculosis, multiple radiculitis, bronchial foreign body and more after surgery, in addition, can also be seen in inhalation pneumonia, bronchiectasis, intracranial hemorrhage, endocardial fibroelastosis, congenital heart disease, tumors, etc.","['hypoxemia', 'chest pain', 'breathing difficulties', 'hair sputum', 'heart palpitations']",['lung abscess'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['anti-infective treatment', 'fiber bronchoscope tracheal irrigation']"
pediatric cold,"children with colds, also known as acute upper respiratory infections (acuteupperrespiratory infections), is the most common disease in children, mainly invading the nose, nasopharynx and pharynx, often diagnosed as rhinitis, nasopharyngitis, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, etc., can also be collectively referred to as upper respiratory tract infection, referred to as ""upper feeling"".nasopharyngeal infections often have complications involving adjacent organs such as the larynx, trachea, lungs, mouth, sinuses, middle ear, eyes, and cervical lymph nodes.common causes are viral and bacterial infections, mainly viral infections, common viruses, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coxsackie virus, echovirus and so on.bacterial infections can often occur after viral infection. commonly, hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and mycoplasma pneumoniae can also be caused.the disease can cause otitis media, sinusitis, throat wall abscess, tonsil abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, etc., group a hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis can cause acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever.therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively observe and analyze the clinical features of upper respiratory tract infection and its complications, so that early diagnosis, early treatment, and improvement of curative effect should not be considered as a daily illness and rash treatment.","prevention 1. active exercise: it is very important to use physical factors to exercise physique. for example, frequent window sleep, outdoor activities, etc. are all positive methods. as long as they are consistent and often carried out, they can enhance physical fitness and prevent upper respiratory tract infection. 2, talk about hygiene, to avoid the cause of the disease: clothes too much or too little, room temperature is too high or too low, sudden changes in the weather, environmental pollution and passive smoking, etc., are the cause of upper respiratory tract infection, should pay attention to prevention. 3, to avoid cross-infection: wash hands after contact with sick children, if necessary, wear gowns, isolation not only protects neighboring children, but also reduces complications in sick children, can be performed in general care institutions and hospitals, adult patients in the family avoid contact with healthy children. the ward should be ventilated, maintain proper temperature, disinfect the bed of discharged patients and keep clean empty beds, so that you can receive new patients at any time. if conditions permit, you can use uv to irradiate the ward and contaminated areas for disinfection. the pathogens are all scattered. 4, drug prevention: card slow shu, infant 5ml, children 10ml oral, 3 times a day, 3 to 6 months for a course of treatment, l-tetrazole, 2.5mg (kg { d), 2 days a week, 3 the month is a course of treatment. the traditional chinese medicine astragalus membranaceus is 6 to 9 g daily for 2 to 3 months. the above drugs can improve the body's cellular and humoral immune function. repeated upper respiratory tract infection can reduce the number of recurrences after application. pediatrics of beijing friendship hospital used traditional chinese medicine. adding flavor yupingfeng powder (formula: raw scutellaria 9g, atractylodes 6g, windproof 3g, raw oyster 9g, dried tangerine peel 6g, yam 9g, research into fine) 2 times a day, each time 3g oral, through 3 years observation, think this drug it seems to weaken the immunity of children and reduce the incidence of repeated respiratory infections. 5, vaccination: recently, the application of attenuated virus vaccine, by intranasal drip and / or aerosol inhalation, can stimulate the production of secretory iga antibodies in the nasal cavity and upper respiratory tract mucosa, thereby enhancing the respiratory tract's defense ability against infection, a large number research work indicates that secretory iga is more effective against respiratory infections than any serum antibody, and because of the large number of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, vaccine prevention is possible.","80% to 90% of the colds are caused by viruses, and there are more than 200 kinds of viruses that can cause colds; 10% to 20% of the colds are caused by bacteria. infants under the age of 1 are more likely to have a cold because the immune system is not yet mature. the child's nasal cavity is narrow, the mucous membrane is soft, the mucosal gland is insufficiently secreted, it is dry, and it is poorly adapted and resistant to the external environment, and it is prone to inflammation. premature infants, children with congenital defects or diseases, such as cardiopulmonary insufficiency, especially those with congenital immune diseases, may have a cold when they take care of a slight mistake. a survey of 157 parents on the ※children's nutrition knowledge survey§ showed that only 10.2% of people know about general parenting nutrition. due to the rapid growth of children, children who are artificially fed due to lack of breast milk, as well as children who are overly pampered, partial eclipse, or anorexia, may cause different levels of iron deficiency, calcium deficiency or insufficient intake of vitamins and protein. . nutrients such as iron, zinc and protein play an important role in the synthesis of various globulins of the immune system and in promoting the maturation and differentiation of immune cells, affecting the resistance of the child's body. the body lacks vitamin a, causing the cilia of the respiratory epithelial cells to decrease and disappear, the gland loses its normal function, the lysozyme and secreted immune antibodies are significantly reduced, and the barrier function is reduced, which may lead to infection. insufficient calcium intake can cause rickets in children, resulting in low resistance and vulnerability to viral and bacterial infections. low calcium can cause the ciliary movement of the airway epithelial cells to weaken, making the secretions of the respiratory tract difficult to discharge. these are the causes of the cold. some children have poor family room conditions, dark and humid; some indoor temperatures are too much or too low; some families like to close the doors and windows all day long, the air is not circulating; some family members like to smoke, plus the same room fire, smoke pollution serious. poor environment, turbid air, and great harm to the respiratory tract are important causes of colds. some parents dress too much or too little for their children. the result is not sweating or cold, it is easy to induce a cold. due to objective conditions or insufficient attention, many children lack outdoor activities. for example, in the northern part of china and in the cold season, children spend most of their time indoors and rarely have the opportunity to be outdoors. some parents love children and keep their children in air-conditioned rooms. once these children are cold, they can't adapt and are prone to colds.","['weak', 'pediatric nasal congestion', 'children have a red spot after fever"", 'sore pain', 'tank inflammation', 'runny nose', 'nasal stuff', 'low fever']","['laryngitis', 'otitis media']","['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'symptomatic and supportive treatment']"
asthma,"bronchial asthma (bronchialasthma), referred to as asthma, is composed of a variety of cells (such as mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, t lymphocytes, airway epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells) and cellular components (such as il- 2, histamine, leukotriene, etc.) involved in airway chronic inflammatory diseases.clinically, the main manifestations are that the airway is highly reactive to a variety of stimuli, and there may be recurrent wheezing, symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or cough, which are often caused or aggravated at night and/or in the early morning, most patients symptoms can be relieved on their own or after treatment.in recent years, the prevalence and mortality of asthma in the united states, britain, australia, new zealand and other countries have increased. about 300 million asthma patients worldwide have become a major chronic disease that seriously threatens public health. the rate is about 0.5% to 5%, and it is increasing year by year. it is estimated that there are more than 60 million asthma patients in the country.","daily asthma prevention: 1. avoid re-contact with allergens. for example, if the indoor dust or sputum induces the onset of asthma, the indoors should be kept clean, the sun should be smashed, and the windows should be kept open to keep the indoor air fresh. 2, it is not appropriate to keep cats, dogs and other small animals indoors. 3, usually should pay attention to exercise, such as commonly used cold water bath, dry towel body, etc., so that the nervous state of the lungs, trachea, bronchial vagus nerves are alleviated. 4, balanced nutrition, avoid mental stimulation, avoid colds and excessive fatigue also play an important role in the prevention of asthma attacks. health education: 1. psychological guidance: instruct patients to treat asthma correctly, establish confidence in overcoming the disease, and let patients know that asthma can not be eradicated, but it can be completely controlled. explain to the patient the relationship between mental factors such as mental emotion and asthma attacks, so that patients maintain a good mentality and avoid fear. 2, diet guidance: asthma patients' diet should be light and easy to digest. at the same time, it should be noted that some foods such as seafood, especially shrimp can induce asthma, need to be avoided, and some foods such as almonds, peanuts and other nuts may also induce asthma attacks, need to be avoided. 3, environmental factors: because asthma is related to allergens in the environment, so try to reduce allergens in the environment, such as keeping indoor air circulation, avoiding dust, pollen, gas, smoke and all other irritating substances. avoid contact with allergic dust mites, fungi, fur, food, drugs, etc., outdoor air should reduce pollution, avoid going out in the dusty weather or wearing a mask. 4, medication guidance: standard use of drugs is the premise and basis for effective treatment. because asthma occurs in genetics, asthma can not be cured. the treatment of asthma is basically lifelong. the medication must be carried out under the guidance of a doctor to avoid random withdrawal. 5, teach patients to use peak flow meter, monitor asthma treatment, and guide asthma patients to remember the asthma diary. 6. instruct patients to exercise: appropriate activities such as walking, playing tai chi, etc., can not only exercise, but also exercise lung function. however, for patients with exercise asthma, exercise may induce asthma attacks and require attention.","asthma is a disease that occurs through the interaction of environmental factors based on genetic susceptibility. genetic susceptibility involves multiple genes and their interactions, and the environmental factors that cause disease are also diverse. genetics is the main host factor. the absence of a known gene in two or more study populations suggests that intergenic interactions may be more important and reaffirm the polygenic inheritance of asthma. in addition, the targets of drug action, such as 汕2 receptors, glucocorticoid receptors and other related genes are also research hotspots. the abnormalities of these genes may not only be related to the pathogenesis, but also related to the therapeutic effect. obesity is an independent risk factor for asthma, especially in women. obese asthma patients are more difficult to treat. possible mechanisms: 1. change the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. 2, adipose tissue release il-6, tnf-汐, eotaxin, estrogen and other inflammatory factors, so that the immune function as a whole promotes a pro-inflammatory tendency. 3. the occurrence of obesity is also a concentrated reflection of some defects in the body in genetics, development, endocrine, and neuromodulation. these defects may also be the cause of asthma. 1. inhalation of allergens is the cause of asthma, and this view has been widely accepted. dermatophagoides sp. is the most common inhaled allergen that induces asthma attacks. pollen, ragweed, and fungal spore-induced asthma are often seasonal. when a storm occurs, a large amount of pollen is often raised, which may cause many asthma patients to attack at the same time, called ""thunderstorm asthma"". allergens that are present in the environment all the year round can cause chronic persistent symptoms in patients. most of these allergens are derived from household pet dander, mites, dust, and the like. 2. the relationship between allergens and asthma is complicated, and may be affected by various factors such as the type of allergen, the dose of exposure, the time of exposure, the age of the host at the time of exposure, and the genetic characteristics of the host. sometimes, early exposure to allergies it can induce immune tolerance and has a protective effect. in addition, strict avoidance of exposure to allergens does not reduce the risk of developing asthma. 1. exposure to smoking smoke in the uterus and after birth can increase the risk of asthma-like symptoms in children. 2, smoking has a serious negative impact on asthma patients: can lead to frequent attacks of asthma, accelerated decline in lung function, more serious illness, increased hospitalization rate, weaken the role of corticosteroids, higher mortality.there is a neutrophil-predominant inflammatory response in the airways of smoking asthma patients, which is different from general asthma. 1, air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, ozone, can induce asthma attacks. 2. the impact of air pollutants on the prevalence of asthma remains undetermined.cities with serious traffic pollution have not found an increase in the prevalence of asthma.","['two lungs

pediatric asthma,"bronchialia (bronchialasthma), referred to as asthma, is a reversible, obstructive respiratory disease characterized by recurrent cough, wheezing and difficulty breathing, accompanied by airway hyperresponsiveness.it is a common chronic respiratory disease that seriously endangers children's health. the incidence rate is high. it is characterized by recurrent chronic disease, which seriously affects the learning, life and activities of children and affects the growth and development of children and adolescents.many children with asthma have prolonged unhealed due to untimely treatment or improper treatment, and eventually developed into adult asthma.impaired lung function, some patients even completely lost physical labor ability.severe asthma attacks can be fatal if not treated promptly and effectively.children are similar to adults in terms of definition of asthma, etiology, pathogenesis, immunology, pathophysiology, and principles of diagnosis and treatment.however, there are still differences in some aspects between children and adults with asthma.children with asthma are in the process of continuous growth and development of intelligence, body, mind and immune system, especially in the aspects of immunity and pathophysiology. children's asthma has its own particularity.","repeated episodes of bronchial asthma have a great impact on the growth, life and learning of children, and should be prevented as soon as possible.avoid contact with allergens and identify predisposing factors.learn more about the predisposing factors and the details of the onset of each disease, pay attention to prevent respiratory infections, and eliminate the lesions (such as timely treatment of sinusitis, nasal polyps, tonsillitis, dental caries, etc.).avoid overwork, rain, running and emotional stimulation.try to avoid contact and timely treatment of known allergens, such as contact with pollen, application of aspirin and other drugs, conditions can improve the environment or easy to live.","(1) causes of the disease the incidence of asthma in the world is between 0.1% and 32%, and the difference is close to 300 times. the reason may be related to genetics, age, geographical location, climate, environment, ethnicity, industrialization, urbanization, interior decoration. , living standards, eating habits, etc. the factors that induce bronchial asthma are various. common factors include the following: allergens are roughly divided into three categories: 1 pathogens causing infection and their toxins. children with asthma attacks are often closely related to respiratory infections, and more than 95% of infants and young children have asthma. it is caused by respiratory infections. the main pathogens are respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), adenovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus. respiratory syncytial virus infection has been shown to cause wheezing due to specific ige-mediated type i allergic reactions. other local infections such as sinusitis, tonsillitis, and dental caries may also be predisposing factors. 2 inhalation: usually inhaled from the respiratory tract, domestic skin tests show that the main cause of asthma is dust mites, house dust, mold, multi-valent pollen (artemisia, ragweed), feathers and so on. it has also been reported that exposure to silkworms causes asthma, especially as an inhalation allergen, which plays an important role in respiratory allergic diseases. childhood allergies to ticks are more than adults, and spring and autumn are the most suitable season for cockroaches to survive. therefore, dust mite asthma occurs in spring and autumn, and is common in nighttime cases. in addition, asthma attacks caused by inhalation of allergens are often related to the season, region and living environment, and once stopped, the symptoms can be alleviated or disappeared. 3 food: mainly foreign protein, such as milk, eggs, fish and shrimp, spices and so on. food allergies are common in infancy and gradually decrease after 4 to 5 years of age. non-specific irritants (20%): such as dust, smoke (including cigarettes and mosquito coils), odor (industrial irritating gas, cooking oil odor and oily knee), these substances are non-antigenic substances that can stimulate the bronchial mucosa sensory nerve endings and vagus nerves cause reflex cough and bronchospasm. sometimes inhalation of cold air can also induce bronchospasm. some scholars believe that air pollution is becoming more and more serious, and it may be one of the important reasons for the increased prevalence of bronchial asthma. children who are sensitive to climate change, such as sudden cooling or reduced air pressure, often induce asthma attacks. therefore, the incidence of children in the spring and autumn is generally increased. in children with asthma, mental factors cause asthma attacks not as obvious as adults, but asthma children are often affected by emotions, such as crying or impulsive, fear can cause asthma attacks. some scholars have confirmed that ecstasy is often accompanied by emotional excitement or other mental activity disorders. asthma is hereditary, and the prevalence of family and personal allergies, such as asthma, infant eczema, urticaria, and allergic rhinitis, is higher than that of the general population. foreign reports of about 90% of children with asthma, often stimulate asthma after exercise, also known as exercise induced asthma (eia), more common in older children. it is most likely to induce asthma after running violently (5-10 minutes or more). drug-induced asthma is also more common. there are two main types of drugs, one is aspirin and similar antipyretic analgesics, which can cause so-called endogenous asthma. if accompanied by sinusitis and nasal polyps, it is called aspirin triad, other similar drugs have indomethacin, methamoleic acid and so on. the mechanism that causes asthma may be that aspirin inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, leads to a decrease in camp levels, and releases chemical mediators to cause asthma. this type of asthma often decreases with age and decreases after puberty. another type of drug is a drug that acts on the heart, such as propranolol. equality of the mind can block the beta receptor and cause asthma. in addition, many spray inhalers can also cause stimulation of the throat reflex caused by bronchospasm, such as sodium cromoglycate, phlegm and so on, other such as lipiodol angiography, sulfa drug allergy can often induce asthma attacks. (b) the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma is a complex disease caused by multiple factors, the pathogenesis is still unknown, the currently recognized mechanism has the following three aspects. 1. type i allergic reaction and ige synthesis regulation disorder after the antigen (allergen) enters the human body for the first time, it acts on b lymphocytes to make it into plasma cells to produce ige. ige is adsorbed on mast cells or basophils, and its fc segment binds to specific receptors on the cell membrane surface. ige is firmly adsorbed on the cell membrane, causing the body to be sensitized. when the corresponding antigen re-enters the sensitized body, it adsorbs on the mast cells and basophils membrane and binds to ige, which leads to degranulation of the cell membrane and releases a series of chemistry. the medium includes histamine, slow-reacting substances, bradykinin, serotonin and prostaglandins. these biologically active substances can cause telangiectasia, enhanced permeability, smooth muscle tendon and hypersecretion of glands, causing bronchi. asthma. in recent years, many studies have shown that the increase of ige is also related to cellular immune dysfunction. a large number of studies have shown that t cells not only have quantitative changes, but also may have functional defects. in addition, high ige may also be associated with delayed t cell maturation. 2, airway inflammation changes by fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) biopsy of asthma animal models and asthma patients, demonstrating that airway tissue shows varying degrees of inflammatory changes. 3, airway hyperresponsive airway hyperresponsiveness, that is, the airway has abnormally increased reactivity to various specific or non-specific stimuli, asthmatic children have airway hyperresponsiveness, airway hyperresponsive immediate response (type i allergic reaction) ), and continuous response. it is currently believed that persistent airway hyperresponsiveness is mainly associated with airway inflammation, and the mechanism of airway hyperresponsiveness during inflammation is mainly related to inflammatory mediators. the study found that the airway's reactivity to histamine and acetylcholine is parallel to the severity of asthma in children. these are in turn associated with neuromodulation disorders, particularly autonomic dysfunction. it is known that bronchial smooth muscle is dominated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and maintains a dynamic balance under the regulation of the brain-lower hypothalamus-pituitary. normal human bronchial smooth muscle tone depends on the excitatory state of cholinergic receptors. this is not the case with asthmatic children, with increased parasympathetic tone, increased alpha adrenergic neurological activity, and low or partially blocked beta adrenergic nerve function. because of these abnormalities, airway responsiveness in children with asthma is one of the pathophysiological basis of asthma attacks. the main pathological changes of asthma are bronchial smooth muscle spasm, inflammatory cell infiltration, upper basement membrane thickening and airway mucosal edema, epithelial shedding mixed cell debris, increased mucus secretion, mucociliary dysfunction, and then bronchial mucosal hypertrophy and endobronchial mucus embolism.as a result of the above pathological changes, the airway lumen is narrowed, resulting in increased airway resistance and asthma.","['hypoxemia', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'words can't be continuous', 'breathing difficulties', 'wheeze', 'nose fan', 'breathing sound weakened', 'gas rush']",['respiratory failure'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']",['medical treatement']
pneumonia in children,"pediatric pneumonia is a common clinical disease, and it is easy to occur in all seasons, especially in winter and spring.if the treatment is not thorough, it is easy to recurrent and affect the child's development.the clinical manifestations of pneumonia in children are fever, cough, wheezing, and there is also no fever and cough and asthma.the main cause is that the respiratory function of children is low, and when the temperature changes outside, it is prone to infection and pneumonia.","1. the indoor air is fresh and the indoor air is fresh and fluid.open windows and ventilate regularly. 2, diet and sputum in the diet to eat digestible, high-calorie and vitamin-rich foods, soft foods as well, is conducive to the absorption of the digestive tract.it is good to slap the back of the child when coughing, which is good for the discharge of sputum.when shooting back, shoot from bottom to top, do not be too dry in the room, children should drink water properly to dilute the sputum, which is conducive to the discharge of sputum. 3, strengthen the exercise, pay attention to appropriate increase in clothing to prevent upper respiratory tract infections, pay attention to strengthen exercise, you can choose the appropriate exercise method according to age.when you are outdoors, pay attention to the proper addition of clothes.when you have a cold, don't take your child to a public place.when someone in the family has a cold, don't touch the child. 4, enhance the infant's disease resistance ability to adhere to exercise, enhance disease resistance, while paying attention to climate changes, at any time to increase or decrease clothes for children to prevent colds and colds.reasonable feeding to prevent malnutrition.educate children to develop good hygiene habits and not spit.let the infants and children get more sun.constantly improving the disease resistance of infants and young children is the key to preventing the disease.","the prenatal fetus lives in the uterus filled with amniotic fluid, and hypoxia occurs (such as umbilical cord around the neck, fetal heart changes, abnormal fetal movement), respiratory movements occur and inhaled amniotic fluid, causing aspiration pneumonia; such as early water breakage, prolonged labor or in the process of childbirth, inhalation of bacterial contaminated amniotic fluid or birth canal secretions, easy to cause bacterial pneumonia, such as amniotic fluid contaminated by meconium, inhalation of the lungs can cause meconium aspiration pneumonia. if there is a person with poison in the child (such as a cold), the child is easily infected with pneumonia, and the newborn is infected with pneumonia through blood circulation due to sepsis or umbilical inflammation or enteritis.this infection can be caused by bacteria, and newborns with a slightly older age can also be caused by viruses and other microorganisms. such as sudden changes in the climate, poor ventilation in the living room, air pollution and so on.","['drowsiness', 'pale pale', 'coughing more', 'appetite is not good', 'phlegm and sound', 'irritable and uneasy', 'cyanosis', 'nose wing fan', 'yan penghui']","['coma', 'respiratory failure', 'pediatric atelectasis', 'emphysema', 'pediatric bronchiectasis']","['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']",['medical treatement']

(1) centrality - no respiratory movement caused by central nervous system to stop airflow; (2) obstructive - respiratory motion exists without airflow in the respiratory tract; (3) mixed.","children with apnea often have unfavorable perinatal factors, which are associated with increased mortality and prevalence, and there is a link between simple obstructive apnea and neurodevelopmental dysplasia. these children may have apnea due to intraventricular hemorrhage, rather than apnea due to immature. 1. actively correct hypoxemia when using a mask to absorb oxygen, the lower edge of the mask should be placed on the ankle. if placed under the armpit, the trachea can be compressed to cause apnea; the arterial oxygen partial pressure is maintained at 6.65 to 9.31 kpa ( 50 ~ 70mmhg), can reduce the onset of apnea; avoid excessive ventilation of mechanical respiration, because of the consequences of unnecessary hyperventilation, which will affect the sensitivity of the respiratory center, thus causing apnea, at this time should reduce the machinery per minute ventilation of breathing makes paco2 gradually increase. clinically, hypocapnia is seen in patients with mechanical respiration or metabolic acidosis combined with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. 2. active prevention and treatment of various neonatal diseases, neonatal sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, open arterial catheter or necrotizing enterocolitis, can inhibit the respiratory center, apnea, medication with apnea often invalid, need mechanically assisted ventilation.","(a) the cause of the disease 1, primary - premature infants due to hypoplasia of the respiratory center; 2, symptomatic (1) hypoxia: asphyxia, pneumonia, hyaline membrane disease, congenital heart disease and anemia; (2) infection: sepsis, meningitis, etc.; (3) central nervous system disorders: intraventricular hemorrhage and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; (4) the ambient temperature is too high or too low; (5) metabolic disorders: hypoglycemia, low blood sodium, hypocalcemia and hyperammonemia; (6) stomach, esophageal reflux, necrotizing enterocolitis; (7) airflow obstruction due to excessive anterior curvature of the neck, apnea is more common in premature infants, the incidence rate can be as high as 50% to 60%, and the smaller the gestational age, the higher the incidence rate. (b) pathogenesis many clinical phenomena are related to neonatal apnea, some of which may be the cause of apnea. an important feature of various apneas is that they usually occur when the newborn is awake, and the onset of apnea is usually frequent. and persistent, full-term neonates often find a cause, repeated apneas in premature infants have no obvious lesions, and some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of neonatal apnea, during central nervous system regulation, ventilation peripheral respiratory muscle movement and maintenance of airway patency so that there is a fine balance between the gas exchanges, if this balance is broken, it can lead to apnea. the immature development of the brainstem respiratory center is the key to apnea. in the central and mixed apnea episodes, the respiratory center's output to each respiratory muscle is reduced, and the respiratory central neurons do not have the self-discipline of sinus node. the electrophysiological activity of the reticular activity of the spinal cord plays an important role in maintaining the rhythmic release of impulses in the respiratory central nervous system. the afferent impulses from superior (cortical activity) and subordinate (peripheral nerve receptors, reflex arcs) constitute this neural connection can be excitatory or inhibitory, and many neurotransmitters and neuroregulatory secretions (such as endorphins, prostaglandins, and adenosine) can inhibit respiratory center activity, but become older with age. less important, the output of the respiratory center is the combination and balance of the above-mentioned influencing factors. in the newborn, there will be strong and weak periodic changes in regular ventilation. the apnea episode is the period of least ventilation during this cycle. it may also be an unstable manifestation of the respiratory regulation system. it is confirmed by auditory evoked response that children with apnea have no apnea. premature infants in the control group had longer brainstem conduction time, suggesting a delay in the maturation of the central nervous system and supporting the view that as the brain matures, the complex connections between dendrites and synapses increase, and the stability of central respiratory drive is obtained. perfect. the basic chemical drive is relatively ineffective for neonates, especially premature babies. premature infants with gestational age less than 33 weeks have lower sensitivity to ventilating and respiratory muscles to carbon dioxide, and premature infants with apnea, response to carbon dioxide. a line curve shows that the response of ventilation to carbon dioxide increase does not change much, but with the increase of gestational age and postnatal age, the sensitivity to carbon dioxide increases. in premature infants, hypoxia leads to transient hyperventilation, followed by ventilation. insufficient and sometimes apneas, in addition, hypoxia reduces the premature babies' responsiveness to elevated carbon dioxide, which explains why apneas do not end up quickly being stimulated by hypoxia or hypercapnia, this is also the reason for oxygenation to improve critical hypoxemia, or to lose red blood cells to treat anemia to reduce the onset of apnea. overactivity in the upper respiratory tract during the neonatal period is also an important factor in the onset of apnea. there are a large number of nerve endings in the nasal wall, nasopharynx, oropharynx and larynx, which can respond to various chemical and mechanical stimuli. negative pressure suction or insertion into the nasogastric tube stimulates the posterior pharyngeal wall, often induces apnea and reflex bradycardia, and secretions, fluid or stomach contents accumulate in the throat can induce apnea, with age and development the central nervous system has enhanced ability to inhibit these high reactivity. incompatibility and disconnection between the thoracic respiratory muscles (the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles) and the upper respiratory tract (pharyngeal, larynx) muscles that maintain the open airways can lead to ineffective ventilation, and the pharyngeal airways lack an internal rigid support. the neck flexion, the mandibular posterior movement and the hyoid bone are easily collapsed. when inhaling, the diaphragm contraction produces a negative pressure in the pharynx, which aggravates the closure of the airway. the collapsed airway wall obstructs the airway due to the adhesion of mucus. reopening, dispelling airway obstruction requires airway dilatation muscles such as facial muscle contraction or neck extension to expand the airway. in the inhalation process, before the diaphragm contraction, the upper airway respiratory muscles are excited early, this pair of peak airflow it is important to promote ventilation when passing through the upper airway resistance. for the stimulation of high carbonic acid, the upper airway respiratory muscle is a curve reaction, with only a slight increase at the beginning, only a significant increase in the high carbon dioxide level. the reaction of high carbonic acid is expressed as a proportional or nearly linear rise. therefore, the respiratory muscles of the airway do not respond to hypercapnia, the response is small or slow, and the response of the thoracic muscle is sensitive, which is a straight rise. uncoordinated can lead to instability of the upper airway, partial or complete airway obstruction, which can induce airway infarction after central apnea, and explain why short-term apnea is mostly central. longer apneas are mixed. the thoracic and pulmonary stretch receptors provide information on the extent of thoracic dilatation and lung expansion through the vagus nerve into the center, thereby adjusting the intensity and duration of the respiration, and with the increase in lung capacity, strong lung stretch reflex (hering-breuer reflex) the effect is to inhibit inhalation and prolong exhalation; however, as the maturity increases, the reflex is weakened. conversely, when the lung capacity decreases, the expiratory time is shortened to maintain the lung volume, and the inspiratory process is prolonged. the ability of the duration of the inspiratory action is a compensatory mechanism to reduce airway occlusion. in response to end-tidal airway occlusion, the inspiratory action of preterm infants without apnea is significantly longer than that of premature infants with apnea. it is suggested that the more mature the respiratory reflex, the stronger its ability to respond to occlusion. newborn's breathing is significantly affected by sleep. rapid sleep eye (rem) dynamic sleep predominates in premature infants and may be associated with brain development. apnea occurs more frequently during rem sleep, when tidal volume and respiratory rate all of them are obviously irregular. in addition to strong central respiratory regulation inhibition during rem sleep, there is still inhibition of intercostal muscle movement. when the intercostal muscles do not move and the diaphragm changes, the result is chest deformation (contradictory breathing). lead to ineffective ventilation and reduce lung capacity, compensatory increase in diaphragmatic movement, can cause diaphragmatic fatigue and upper airway obstruction, chest deformation can also cause intercostal-sputum inhibition and reflection, limiting the impulse of the phrenic nerve, the final result is apnea. in short, newborns, especially premature infants, are prone to apnea due to immature respiratory center development, easy to cause respiratory regulation disorder, neonatal respiratory system anatomy is not perfect, physiological function is unstable, physiological information can not be transmitted correctly, and respiratory rhythm is not complete periodic breathing and apnea have a common pathophysiological basis. apnea is further developed on the basis of the pathogenesis of periodic breathing. respiratory dysfunction exists in the respiratory center, central chemoreceptors, peripheral chemoreceptors and lung reflexes, possibly multiple the factors play a role, and the respiratory control center of the apnea infant is in a state of inhibition. the tidal volume of the infant is small, the alveolar ventilation is low, the paco2 of the alveoli is high, the pressure in the esophagus during respiration is less, and the ventilation response is poor when paco2 is elevated. the respiratory center is immature, and its impulse is weak, which is related to the poor function of the central nervous system. neonatal apnea can be caused by hypoxia, hypoxia can inhibit the physiological function of the neonatal respiratory center, and can reduce the neonatal response to co2, the more severe the hypoxia of the baby, the worse the response to co2, which is exactly the same as adult hypoxia in contrast, in addition to hypoxia, such as changes in body temperature, hypoglycemia, acidosis, etc. can inhibit the respiratory center, causing apnea. in addition, the accumulation of respiratory secretions and swelling of the bronchial mucosa increase the resistance of the respiratory tract, and even cause a certain degree of airway obstruction. it is necessary to increase the work of breathing to compensate. the compensatory ability of neonatal respiratory work is very poor, when the respiratory load is increased. at the time, it is not possible to effectively prolong the inspiratory time, change the esophageal pressure and increase the effective elasticity for compensation. this imperfection of respiratory reflex function is one of the causes of apnea easily occurring in neonates with respiratory diseases.","['cyanosis', 'central apnea', 'sepsis', 'sudden death', 'breathing slow and irregular', 'heart rate slow']",['encephalopathy'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric

aspiration pneumonia,"aspiration pneumonia (aspiration pneumonitis) refers to chemical pneumonia caused by inhalation of acidic substances, food, stomach contents or other irritating liquids.in severe cases, respiratory failure or respiratory distress syndrome can occur.patients often have a history of inhalation, rapid onset, symptoms appear more than 1 to 3 hours later, clinical manifestations are related to the cause of the disease, such as aspiration pneumonia caused by tracheal-esophageal fistula, every time after eating, there is a cough, shortness of breath .when the mind is unclear, there are no obvious symptoms when inhaling, but after 1 to 2 hours, sudden difficulty in breathing may occur, and cyanosis and hypotension may occur rapidly, and a coughing foamy sputum may often occur, which may bring blood.both lungs smell wet rales and wheezing sounds.in severe cases, respiratory distress syndrome can occur, and can be associated with carbon dioxide retention and metabolic acidosis.the disease is more common in children, as well as general anesthesia, cerebrovascular accident, seizures, alcoholism, overdose or sedatives, the defense reflex function is weakened or disappeared, foreign body can be inhaled into the trachea; various causes of tracheoesophageal fistula food can also enter the trachea directly through the esophagus; iatrogenic factors such as gastric tube stimulation of the pharynx cause vomiting; tracheal intubation or tracheotomy affects laryngeal function, inhibiting normal pharyngeal movement can inhale vomit into the airway; especially in elderly patients, aspiration pneumonia is also prone to occur due to poor body reactivity.","the main measures to prevent aspiration pneumonia are to prevent inhalation of food or stomach contents. for example, the stomach should be fully emptied before anesthesia. for patients with coma, head and side positions can be taken to prevent the patient from inhaling foreign matter in an unintentional state. lung; for anesthesia or coma patients, the stomach tube should be placed as soon as possible, if necessary, tracheal intubation or tracheotomy, strengthening nursing is more important.","normal people have a synergistic effect of epiglottis, glottis, protective reflexes and swallowing. food and foreign bodies are not easy to enter the lower respiratory tract. a small amount of fluid can also be discharged through coughing. when unconscious, such as general anesthesia, cerebrovascular accident, seizures alcoholism or sleeping pills poisoning, etc. due to uncoordinated swallowing and glottic closure, cough is inhibited, foreign body can be inhaled; esophageal lesions such as esophageal achalasia, upper esophageal cancer, zenks esophageal diverticulum, food hypopharyngeal can not all enter the stomach anti-inflow into the trachea; esophageal tracheal fistula caused by cancer or trauma can enter the trachea directly through the esophagus; iatrogenic factors, such as gastric tube stimulation of the pharynx caused by vomiting, tracheal intubation or tracheotomy affect the laryngeal function, inhibit normal pharyngeal movement, etc., can inhale the vomit into the airway, the elderly are more reactive and more likely to have aspiration pneumonia. clinically, aspiration pneumonia caused by inhalation of gastric contents is more common, and kerosene, gasoline, dry cleaning agents, etc. are more common. child. the severity of pneumonia caused by inhalation is related to the concentration of hydrochloric acid in inhaled gastric juice, the amount of inhalation and the distribution in the lung. when the ph of inhaled gastric acid is <2.5, the lung tissue can be seriously damaged. if the inhaled liquid is as low as 50 ml, it can cause lung damage. in animal experiments, it was confirmed that when the liquid with a ph < 1.5 was inhaled at 3 ml/kg, the animal died 100%. the wider the distribution range of the inhalation liquid, the more serious the damage. pathogenesis: after inhaling the contents of the stomach, gastric acid stimulates the bronchus to cause strong bronchospasm, followed by acute inflammatory reaction of the bronchial epithelium and inflammatory cell infiltration around the bronchi. the gastric juice entering the alveoli rapidly spreads to the surrounding lung tissue, and the alveolar epithelial cells are destroyed, degenerated and involved. capillary wall, increased permeability of the vessel wall and destruction of the alveolar capillary wall, formation of interstitial pulmonary edema, alveolar edema, edema and hemorrhage in the alveoli gradually absorbed and formed by a transparent membrane after several days, then cause fibrosis, while inhaling bringing the pharyngeal colonization bacteria into the lungs, producing secondary bacterial infections mainly caused by anaerobic infections, forming lung abscesses, pulmonary edema, weakening of lung tissue elasticity, decreased compliance, decreased lung capacity, and vesicular type ii cells destruction, reduction of surfactant, small airway closure, alveolar collapse caused by atelectasis, insufficient alveolar ventilation, decreased ventilation/blood flow ratio, increased arterial shunt, hypoxemia, massive exudation or reflection of intravascular fluid vasodilatation, blood volume can be reduced by more than 35%, hypovolemic hypotension can occur, inhalation of hydrocarbonthe pathological process of the compound is similar to that of gastric acid inhalation. because of its low surface tension, it spreads in the lungs after inhalation and inactivates the surfactant. it is more prone to atelectasis and pulmonary edema, leading to severe hypoxemia.","['hypoxemia', 'can't see toe walking difficulty', 'respiratory failure', 'retrograde bacterial infection', 'breathing difficulty', 'sickness cough', 'hairpin', 'mixed acid-base balance disorder', 'metabolic acidosis', 'rale']","['lung atelectasis', 'pulmonary edema', 'acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'epilepsy', 'respiratory failure']","['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['high concentration of oxygen', 'export or aspirate foreign body', 'anti-infection', 'basic disease treatment and supportive treatment']"

bacterial pneumonia,"bacterial pneumonia (bacterial pneumonia) accounts for 80% of all kinds of pathogen pneumonia in adults. since the era of antibiotics, the prognosis of bacterial pneumonia has improved significantly, but since the 1960s, the mortality rate has remained high, and some new features of bacterial pneumonia have emerged. including pathogen spectrum changes, especially in hospitals, the rate of g-bacteria in pneumonia has increased significantly. although streptococcus pneumoniae still dominates community-acquired pneumonia pathogens, clinical manifestations tend to be atypical.the rate of bacterial resistance is increasing, so-called ""refractory"" pneumonia is common, especially in children, the elderly and immunosuppressed patients, the mortality rate is extremely high, the pathogenic diagnosis level is improved, the antibiotics are rationally applied, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria is avoided, and support is improved. treatment is an urgent need to emphasize and solve the clinical treatment of pneumonia.","old age, with severe underlying diseases, immune function inhibition host pneumonia has a poor prognosis. after the widespread use of antibacterial drugs, the mortality rate of pneumococcal pneumonia has dropped from 30% to 6%, but gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus it is a pneumonia caused by mrsa, the mortality rate is still high, enhance physical fitness, avoid upper respiratory tract infection, and the selective application of vaccine in high-risk patients has certain significance in preventing pneumonia.","according to anatomical classification, pneumonia can be divided into large leaf, lobular and interstitial. for the convenience of treatment, it is classified according to the cause, mainly infectious and physical and chemical properties such as radiation, poison gas, drugs and allergic reactions such as allergies. pneumonia, etc., the majority of clinical findings are bacterial, viral, chlamydia, mycoplasma, rickettsia, fungi and parasites caused by infectious pneumonia, of which bacteria are most common. the pathogens of pneumonia vary greatly depending on the age of the host, the disease and immune function, and the mode of acquisition (community-acquired pneumonia or nosocomial pneumonia). the common pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and gold. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, legionella, anaerobic bacteria and viruses, mycoplasma and chlamydia, while in hospital pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas, klebsiella, escherichia coli, sulcus and gut bacillus, proteus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and fungi are common, and most of the aspiration pneumonia is anaerobic infection. immune defense mechanisms such as filtration and humidification of inhaled gases, epiglottis and cough reflexes, bronchial cilia mucus excretion system, body fluids and cellular immune functions, keep the trachea, bronchi and alveolar tissues sterile and impaired immune function (eg cold, hunger, fatigue, drunkenness, coma, inhalation of poison gas, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, uremia, malnutrition, viral infections and application of glucocorticoids, artificial airways, nasogastric tubes, etc.) or into the lower respiratory tract when the pathogenic bacteria are more toxic or more abundant, pneumonia is prone to occur. the main way of bacterial invasion is aspiration and inhalation of oropharyngeal colonization. the former is the most important pathogenesis of pneumonia, especially in hospitals. internal pneumonia and gram-negative bacilli pneumonia, direct bacterial planting, infection of adjacent sites or other parts of the bloodstream are rare. the typical pathological changes of pneumococcal pneumonia are divided into four stages: early stage is mainly edema fluid and serous precipitation; middle stage is red blood cell exudation; late stage has a large number of white blood cells and phagocytic cells, lung tissue mutation; finally, pneumonia absorption dissipates, antibacterial drugs after application, the development of whole lobaric inflammation is rare. typical lung consolidation is less, and replaced by pulmonary segmental inflammation. the pathological feature is that there is no destruction of alveolar walls and other lung structures throughout the lesion. or necrosis, after the pneumonia dissipates, the lung tissue can completely return to normal without leaving fibrosis or emphysema. although other bacterial pneumonias have similar pathological processes as mentioned above, most of them are accompanied by different degrees of alveolar wall destruction, staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. the coagulase produced by the bacteria can form a protective membrane outside the bacteria to kill the phagocytic cells, and the release of various enzymes can lead to the formation of necrosis and abscess in the lung tissue, and the lesion can invade or penetrate the pleura to form a pus. chest or pus pneumothorax, lung air sac can be formed when the lesion is dissipated, gram-negative bacillus pneumonia is mostly bilateral lobular pneumonia, often with multiple necrotic cavities or abscesses, some diseasespeople can develop empyema, dissipation is often incomplete, can cause fibrosis, residual suppuration and bronchiectasis.","['shock', 'pale pale', 'difficulty breathing', 'citrine sputum', 'horse blood', 'low force', 'rust color sputum', 'shock']",['meningitis'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

obstructive emphysema,"obstructive emphysema can be divided into localized obstructive emphysema and diffuse obstructive emphysema, which is now generally referred to as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a pathological change in the respiratory system.it refers to the persistent expansion of the distal lung tissue of the distal bronchioles due to the increase of residual air volume, accompanied by the destruction of the alveolar space, resulting in a weakened lung tissue and a pathological state of increased volume.chronic bronchitis is induced by long-term smoking, air pollution, inhalation of harmful chemicals and dust, and chronic recurrent respiratory infections, further developing the disease.","focus on preventing the development of patients with chronic bronchitis as airflow limitation, including promoting smoking is harmful to health, smokers should immediately quit smoking; avoid harmful dust, smoke or gas inhalation, factories, mines should be treated with dust and harmful gases, such as wet operation, closed dust source, enhanced ventilation and personal protection; prevention of respiratory infections, including viruses, mycoplasma or bacterial infections, regular injection of influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, etc. have a certain significance for the prevention of susceptible; for patients with chronic bronchitis regular monitoring of pulmonary ventilation function (fevl, fevl/fvc and fevl%), early detection of airflow limitation, and appropriate prevention measures; in addition, improve patient living standards, increase nutrition, strengthen health education, improve working environment and conditions, to develop good health habits, etc., have important significance for the prevention and treatment of this disease, in addition to avoid cold and emotional stimulation, avoid tobacco and fat diet and contact with irritating gases, red dates, chinese yam, lily, walnut kernels are eaten.","(a) the cause of obstructive emphysema is extremely complicated, as follows: 1. smoking cigarettes contain a variety of harmful ingredients, such as tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide. smokers have increased fucoidan and neuraminic content in mucous glands, which can inhibit bronchial mucociliary activity, reflexive bronchospasm, and weaken alveolar phagocytes. smokers who have emphysema or chronic bronchitis and die from respiratory failure or pulmonary heart disease are far more likely than non-smokers. 2. atmospheric pollution autopsy materials prove that the incidence of emphysema in areas with severe air pollution is higher than that in less polluted areas under similar climate and economic conditions. 3. infection with respiratory viruses and bacterial infections is related to the occurrence of emphysema. repeated infection can cause bronchial mucosa congestion, edema, glandular hyperplasia, hypertrophy, hypersecretion, thickening and narrowing of the wall, causing airway obstruction. increased protease activity in pulmonary infection may also be associated with emphysema formation. 4. protease-antiprotease balance imbalance some proteolytic enzymes in the body have a digestive effect on lung tissue, while anti-protease has an inhibitory effect on various proteases such as elastase. the balance between protease and anti-protease is an important factor in maintaining the normal structure of lung tissue from damage. there are two sources of proteases for digesting lung tissue, exogenously derived from pathogens such as bacteria and molds, endogenously derived from neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. smoking increases elastase activity and inactivates anti-protease. 式1 antitrypsin is a glycoprotein synthesized by the liver that inhibits the activity of various serine proteases. alpha 1 antitrypsin is controlled by a pair of autosomal recessive genes, which are normal humans because of the m type, ie pimm. if glutamic acid is replaced by lysine, it is z-form. in the foreign data report population, pizz homozygotes accounted for about 1/4000, and pimz heterozygotes accounted for about 3% to 5%. pizz homozygotes have a severe decrease in 汐1 antitrypsin activity in their serum. susceptible to hepatitis and emphysema. the emphysema caused by 汐1 anti-trypsin deficiency has the following characteristics: early onset age, no smoking history; shorter course, more acute urgency; serum protein electrophoresis showed decreased 汐1 globulin and decreased serum 汐1 antitrypsin activity. pathologically, it is mostly lobular emphysema. the incidence of emphysema in other types such as piss and various heterozygotes pimz and pisz is not increased. alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is more common in caucasians and is rare in china. (b) the pathogenesis 1. chronic bronchial inflammatory injury caused by various factors such as infection, smoking, air pollution, occupational dust and long-term inhalation of harmful gases, and allergic factors can cause chronic inflammation of the bronchial the stenosis of the lumen is incompletely blocked, so that the gas can easily enter the alveoli during inhalation, and the bronchus is further closed due to the increase of pressure in the pleural cavity during exhalation, resulting in excessive residual gas in the alveoli and hyperinflation of the alveoli. chronic inflammation can also damage small the bronchial wall cartilage tissue causes the bronchus to lose its normal scaffold function, and the bronchus is easy to trap when exhaled, hindering the gas discharge, resulting in excessive accumulation of air in the alveoli, increased pressure and excessive expansion in the alveoli, and, in addition, due to alveolar pressure increased, the capillary wall of the alveolar wall is compressed, the blood supply of the lung tissue is reduced and the nutritional disorder can also cause the alveolar wall to decrease. therefore, chronic bronchial inflammatory injury is an important cause of obstructive emphysema. the mechanism of copd airway inflammation is that when the body is stimulated by factors such as smoking, infection and environmental pollution, monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils rapidly synthesize and release cytokines such as il-1, tnf-. 汐, ifn, etc., these factors can induce the increase of vascular endothelial cell synthetic adhesion molecules (icam-1, vcam-1), in addition, can also activate adhesion molecules on the surface of leukocytes (lfa-1, vla-4, mac-1, etc.) it upregulates its expression and interacts with the corresponding adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, leading to rapid adhesion of leukocytes, and translocation to the inflammatory site across the endothelium to participate in the inflammatory response, while the above-mentioned pathogenic factors such as smoking, infection and other damage to the lung tissue it can also stimulate epithelial cells. macrophages produce neutrophil chemokine il-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (mip-2), activate and chemotaxis of neutrophils at target sites, which aggravates inflammatory response, in addition, activated neutrophils release proteolytic enzymes and elastase can cause bronchial epithelial shedding, ciliary movement is reduced, mucus secretion is hyperthyroidism, leading to mucus retention and bacterial reproduction, causing inflammation for recurrence and delayed healing. 2. protease-antiprotease balance imbalance it is believed that some proteolytic enzymes in the body have damage damage to lung tissue, while anti-protease has inhibitory effect on various proteases such as elastase. protease and anti-protease maintain balance to ensure lung important factors that protect the normal structure from damage, such as anti-protease deficiency or increased protease, can lead to emphysema in the destruction of lung tissue structure. (1) anti-protease: an anti-protease system in human body, that is, a protease inhibitor, wherein 汐1-antitrypsin (汐1-at) is the most active one, in addition, 汐2- macroglobulin (汐2-m) and antileukoprotease (alp), 汐1-at is an acute phase reaction protein synthesized by the liver with a molecular weight of 45-56 kd and a normal serum concentration of 1360I176 mg/l. in a variety of inflammatory reactions, serum 汐1-at levels can be increased, which can inhibit the activity of various serine proteases. 汐2-m is mainly synthesized by hepatocytes, and has a large molecular weight. when vascular permeability increases, the level of lung tissue begins. elevated, alp synthesis and excretion are in the airway, and have the effect of inactivating elastase. therefore, under normal conditions, 汐1-at, 汐2-m and alp synergistically protect the lungs and airways from proteases. damage. (2) protease: the main source of proteases that destroy lung tissue is two: an exogenous protease from pathogenic bacteria; two endogenous proteases from neutrophils and macrophages, in which human neutral elastase (hne) the most important, and the most serious pathogenesis of emphysema, hne is a serine protease, each containing about 3mg of neutrophils, 106 granulocytes can hydrolyze 0.4mg of lung elastin in vitro, 汐1-at can it is 1:1 combined with hne to form a complex that is not easily dissociated, and the elastase is inactivated. macrophage elastase is a metalloproteinase. it needs to have a metal ion to function, and the protease content in macrophages. it is only equivalent to 1/10 of neutrophils, which is not inhibited by 汐1-at, but instead can hydrolyze 汐1-at and lose its anti-hne effect. when bronchial-pulmonary infection or long-term stimulation of cigarette smoke and other harmful substances, alveolar macrophages and neutrophils aggregate and activate, releasing elastase, when the content and activity of protease exceeds the resistance in local lung tissue. when the protease (汐1-at-based) inhibits the potency, the elastin is degraded, causing the lung tissue to ablate, the alveolar septum is destroyed, the alveolar cavity is enlarged, and the small airway loses the support of the surrounding space during exhalation and traps, resulting in trapping. the occurrence of emphysema. in addition, during the development of emphysema, neutrophils and alveolar macrophages also generate and release oxygen free radicals, which oxidize the active core methionine in 汐1-at to form sulfoxide, thereby making it resistant to proteases. significantly reduced, smokers' 汐1-at activity is only 60% of non-smokers. therefore, smoking can disrupt the balance of protease-anti-protease system and promote the occurrence and development of emphysema. 3. genetic factors the occurrence of emphysema is also related to genetic factors. in normal human serum, 汐1-at is inherited by autosomal recessive genes. in the genetic process, the majority of normal populations are composed of 2 m-type alleles. the gene consists of homozygote, the genetic phenotype is pimm, the carrier's 汐1-at serum concentration is normal (>250mg/dl), homozygous consists of two z-type alleles, pizz is its phenotype, and its serum 汐1 - at is only 10% to 15% (<50mg/dl) of normal people, and the number of people carrying the genetic phenotype is very small, only about 1:2000 (0.05%-0.07%) in the caucasian population; in addition, with 汐1 -at lacks the relevant homozygote, its genetic phenotype is piss, as the heterozygote is composed of two different allele combinations, the genetic phenotype is more pimz (4% to 4.7%), followed by pims (0.5%) and pisz (0.08% ~ 0.14%), the remaining heterozygous phenotype is more common, according to a survey of 3,724 chinese people, the 汐1-at genetic phenotype is still mainly pimm, no one found pizz homozygote, other types the incidence of emphysema such as piss and pimz and pisz is not high. therefore, emphysema caused by hereditary 汐1-at deficiency is not important in china. 4. pathological changes in the general examination showed excessive expansion of the lungs, decreased elasticity, lungs can not retract after thoracotomy, the appearance of gray or pale, the surface can be seen in a number of large bubbles of different sizes, the end of the end of the end of the bronchiole balloon expansion the interval is narrowed, the elastic fibers become thinner or broken, the alveolar wall becomes thinner, the alveolar pores expand, the alveolar ruptures or forms a large bubble, and the small blood vessels associated with the bronchioles show inflammatory changes, the smooth muscle edema of the media, smoothness and necrosis, the lumen is narrow or even occluded. the number of pulmonary capillary beds and the cross-sectional area are reduced due to the destruction of alveolar rupture and inflammation. the pathological changes of bronchioles in emphysema are the same as those of chronic bronchitis. according to the location of emphysema involving the lobules of the lungs, obstructive emphysema can be divided into the following three types: (1) central lobe emphysema: more common in the upper part of the lung, due to terminal bronchioles or first-grade respiration the bronchus is caused by inflammation and the lumen is narrowed. the distal secondary respiratory bronchioles are cystic dilatation, which is characterized by the cystic dilated respiratory bronchioles located in the central region of the secondary leaflets (fig. 3). (2) total lobular emphysema: diffusely invaded the whole lung, but the former lower part is more common, due to the respiratory bronchial stenosis caused by the terminal lung tissue, namely the alveolar duct-alveolar sac and alveolar expansion, it is characterized by a small cystic cavity that is spread throughout the lobules of the lung (figure 4). (3) mixed emphysema: there are pathological changes of the above two types in the same lung, mostly on the basis of the central type of the lobule, and the lung tissue in the peripheral area of the lobular swell is expanded.","['when exhaling, cheeks bulge and shrink lips', 'barrel chest', 'breathing difficulty', 'chest suffocation', 'chest tightness', 'exhalation sound extension', 'breathing sound weakened', 'qi rush' ]","['obstructive emphysema', 'respiratory failure', 'chronic pulmonary heart disease', 'stomach ulcer']","['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
mycoplasma pneumonia,"mycoplasmal pneumonia (mycoplasmal pneumonia) is an acute inflammation of the respiratory tract and lungs caused by mycoplasmal pneumonia (mp). it has been called primary atypical pneumonia (pseudo-typical pneumonia), often accompanied by pharyngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia.slow onset, fever, paroxysmal irritating cough, a small amount of mucous or mucopurulent sputum (even bloody), lung signs are not obvious, but easy to cause extra-pulmonary involvement, can also threaten life or death it occurs in children or adolescents, accounting for about 10% of the total number of pneumonia, accounting for one-third of non-bacterial pneumonia, and the epidemic year can be as high as 40% to 60%; the general prognosis is good and it is a self-limiting disease.","mycoplasmal pneumonia occurs in elderly patients, infants and other immunocompromised patients, often secondary to upper respiratory tract infections, so usually pay attention to physical exercise, often outdoor activities, indoors to open the window ventilation, so that the body is cold and the adaptability of environmental temperature changes is enhanced, and clothes are increased or decreased in time with temperature changes to avoid contact with patients with respiratory infections. in the epidemic season of respiratory infections, avoiding public places, rationally formulating nutrition, and having adequate rest and adequate sleep.","the cause of the disease mycoplasma pneumoniae is the facultative anaerobic between bacteria and viruses, the smallest organism that can live independently. it is mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract. mycoplasma passes through the mucociliary layer on the mucosal surface of the host respiratory tract and adheres to the mucosal epithelial cells through the neuraminidase site on the cell membrane. this adhesion is related to the terminal structure of the p1 protein on the surface of mycoplasma pneumoniae. when this adhesion factor is attached to the airway mucosal epithelial cells, the release of toxic metabolites can lead to decreased ciliary movement and cell damage. in china, pediatric pneumonia is distributed in four seasons, but it occurs mostly in the winter or winter and spring seasons or in the season of sudden changes in climate and frequent colds. in the south, there are also small peaks in the summer or summer and autumn. air pollution, crowded rooms, poor indoor ventilation are the causes of pneumonia in children, and various respiratory infections, diarrhea in children, malnutrition, anemia, rickets, etc. can all be internal factors of pneumonia in children. it is often heavier and has a longer course of disease, which is easy to become a procrastination. the pathogenesis is currently believed to be due to the mycoplasma passing through the mucociliary layer of the mucosal surface of the host respiratory tract and adhering to the mucosal epithelial cells. this adhesion is related to the terminal structure of the p1 protein on the surface of mycoplasma pneumoniae. in the respiratory mucosal epithelial cells, the release of toxic metabolites can lead to decreased ciliary movement and cell damage. after infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae, it can cause humoral immunity and cellular immune response. the humoral immune response first appears specific igm antibody, and then igg antibody appears. for a long time, the secretory iga antibody produced locally in the nasopharynx can effectively inhibit pneumonia. mycoplasma binds to the respiratory epithelium. the respiratory iga antibody is more directly related to the immune status of the host antibody in serum. local antibody is very important in infection defense. local immunity in addition to iga, local cellular immunity also plays a role, because the initial infection makes sensitization in young children causes a heavier clinical manifestation of reinfection, indicating a relationship between the disease and hypersensitivity in the body after infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae. the pathological changes were mainly bronchitis, bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia, edema of the wall, thickening, infiltrating plaque, mucus and even purulent secretion in the bronchi and bronchioles. microscopic bronchitis was shown under the microscope. there is interstitial pneumonia, a small amount of edema fluid and macrophages can be seen in the alveoli, edema in the bronchioles, hyperemia and infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes, neutrophils, exfoliated epithelial cells and cell debris can be seen in the cavity. lymphocytes and mononuclear cells infiltrated in the adjacent alveolar septum, and diffuse alveolar necrosis and hyaline membrane lesions were severely observed.","['pagular rash', 'sore pain', 'increased lung texture', 'muscle soreness', 'appetite loss', 'nasal stuffing', 'qi short', 'living', 'pus sputum']",['myocarditis'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
bronchiectasis,"bronchiectasis refers to the irreversible abnormal expansion of the bronchioles.it is caused by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the bronchus and surrounding lung tissue, which destroys the muscles and elastic tissues of the bronchial wall, leading to bronchial deformation and persistent expansion. typical clinical symptoms include chronic cough, massive cyanosis and repeated hemoptysis, mainly causing disease. the factors are bronchial infection, obstruction and traction, and some have congenital genetic factors. patients have history of childhood measles, whooping cough or bronchial pneumonia. with the improvement of people's lives, measles, pertussis vaccine vaccination, and application of antibiotics, etc. the disease has been significantly reduced.","active treatment of respiratory infections such as sinusitis, tonsillitis, etc.in particular, it is highly important to prevent measles, pertussis, bronchial pneumonia, lung abscess and tuberculosis in childhood, and to prevent the occurrence of bronchiectasis. it is effective for preventing bronchiectasis from inhaling smoke and harmful dust. .the use of pneumococcal or influenza vaccines has a role in preventing acute exacerbations.respiratory rehabilitation exercises are helpful for maintaining lung function.","infection is the most common cause of bronchiectasis. tuberculosis, whooping cough, adenovirus pneumonia can be secondary to bronchiectasis. aspergillus and mycoplasma, as well as pathogens that can cause chronic necrotizing bronchopneumonia, can also be secondary to bronchiectasis. defects in one or more immunoglobulins can cause bronchiectasis, and one or more igg subclasses are often associated with recurrent respiratory infections that can cause bronchiectasis. iga deficiency is not often associated with bronchiectasis, but it can coexist with igg2 subtype defects, causing repeated suppurative infection and bronchiectasis in the lungs. the most common hereditary disease causing bronchiectasis is cystic fibrosis. in addition, it may be due to the weak development of connective tissue, which can also cause bronchiectasis. abnormal cilia structure and function are important causes of bronchiectasis. kartagener syndrome manifests as a triad, visceral transposition, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. the disease is accompanied by abnormal cilia function. long-term presence of foreign bodies in the airways can lead to chronic obstruction and inflammation, secondary to bronchiectasis. pathogenesis bronchiectasis can be divided into columnar, saclike and mixed forms according to its morphology. congenitality is mostly cystic, secondary is mostly columnar, columnar dilated wall damage is light, bronchial appearance is regular, tube diameter is not significantly increased large, only cylindrical expansion at the end, as the disease progresses, bronchial inflammation spreads to the peripheral lung tissue, causing its destruction and fibrosis, forming a cystic dilatation at the distal end, showing a honeycomb shape, often with sputum retention and secondary infection the cyst is further enlarged, and the inflammation spreads to the adjacent lung parenchyma, causing different degrees of pneumonia, small abscess and lobular atelectasis. bronchiectasis is more common in the lower lobe, and the left lower lobe is more slender. it has a large angle with the main bronchus and is affected by the heart and blood vessels. the drainage is not smooth and the chance of infection is more. therefore, the left lower lobe bronchiectasis is more common than the right lower lobe. the bronchial opening of the left tongue is close to the bronchus of the lower back of the lower lobe, which is susceptible to the infection of the lower lobe. therefore, the left lower lobe and the lobes of the lingual lobe often expand at the same time. the bronchial opening of the right middle lobe is relatively thin. there are three groups of lymph nodes in the front and outside. therefore, in non-specific or tuberculous infections, the lymph nodes often enlarge, compressing the right middle bronchus, causing obstruction of atelectasis, followed by bronchiectasis, called mid-leaf syndrome. the small pulmonary artery in the bronchodilatation site often has thrombosis, so that part of the blood in the lesion area is supplied by the bronchial artery. branches of the pulmonary artery and bronchial artery often expand, and the distortion and anastomotic branch increase. small hemangiomas are formed under the mucosa of the wall. damaged, ruptured and become the pathological basis of bronchiectasis hemoptysis. the pathophysiological changes of bronchiectasis depend on the extent and nature of the lesions. because the lungs have great reserve power, such as lesions are limited, they have no effect on the body, respiratory function can generally be unchanged, and columnar expansion has little effect on respiratory function. the cystic dilatation is complicated by obstructive emphysema. if the lesion is more extensive, it is mainly obstructive ventilatory disorder, lung volume is reduced, gas flow rate is decreased, inhalation gas distribution is uneven, physiological shunt is increased, ventilation/blood flow proportional imbalance, the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery anastomosis in the lesion area increased, the traffic branch is open, the anatomical shunt of the lung is also increased, often leading to hypoxemia, respiratory failure, advanced disease, extensive destruction of alveolar capillaries, increased pulmonary circulation resistance, at the same time, hypoxemia worsens, eventually leading to pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary heart disease, and even heart failure.","['menstruation postponed', 'wet rhythm', 'two lungs texture thickening', 'breathing difficulties', 'appetite loss', 'purulent sputum', 'chest stuffing', 'weakness', 'big hemoptysis', '

bronchopneumonia,"bronchial pneumonia, also known as lobular pneumonia, is a major common disease in children, especially in infants and young children, and is the leading cause of death in infancy.pneumonia occurs mostly during the cold seasons of winter and spring and sudden changes in climate, but summer is no exception.even some southern china have more incidences in the summer, and the immunity is not persistent after the illness, and it is easy to be infected again.bronchopneumonia is caused by bacteria or viruses.bronchial pneumonia occurs mostly in the winter and spring seasons and when the climate suddenly changes, some southern china have more incidences in summer.indoor living is crowded, poor ventilation, air pollution, and more pathogenic microorganisms, which are prone to pneumonia.bronchial pneumonia can be caused by bacteria or viruses.","in order to prevent pneumonia, the following measures should be emphasized. 1. strengthen nursing and physical exercise: pay attention to nutrition during infancy, add non-staple food in time, cultivate good diet and hygienic habits, and get more sun exposure to prevent rickets and malnutrition. it is the key to prevent severe pneumonia. ventilation, often in outdoor activities or sleeping outdoors, so that the body is resistant to cold and adapt to changes in environmental temperature, it is not easy to have respiratory infections and pneumonia. 2, to prevent acute respiratory infections and respiratory infections: for infants and young children should be able to avoid contact with respiratory infections, especially weak infants susceptible to development of pneumonia after infection, pay attention to prevention and treatment of respiratory infections that are prone to severe pneumonia, such as whooping cough, influenza, adenovirus and measles infections, especially for immunodeficiency diseases or children with immunosuppressive agents. 3, prevention of complications and secondary infections: infants who have pneumonia, weak resistance, easy to get rid of his disease, should actively prevent complications that may cause serious prognosis, such as empyema, pus gas chest, etc., should be different in the ward the children of the pathogen should be isolated as much as possible. the recovery period and the newly admitted children should also be separated as much as possible. when the medical staff contact different children, they should pay attention to the disinfection and isolation operation. in recent years, it has been reported that the chinese medicine atractylodes, such as atractylodes lancea and ai ye, can reduce the pathogens in the air. this method can be used to prevent cross-infection.","pneumonia occurs mostly during the winter and spring seasons and when the climate suddenly changes, some southern china have more incidences in the summer. indoor living is crowded, poor ventilation, air pollution, and more pathogenic microorganisms, which are prone to pneumonia. bronchial pneumonia can be caused by bacteria or viruses. pneumonia is easy to occur in infants and young children due to the physiological and anatomical features of the respiratory system: such as tracheobronchial stenosis, less mucus secretion, poor ciliary movement, poor development of lung elastic tissue, rich blood vessels, easy congestion, strong interstitial development, and number of alveoli less, the lungs contain less gas, easy to block for mucus. there are also weaknesses in immunology at this age, and the defense function has not yet fully developed, and it is prone to infectious diseases, malnutrition and other diseases. these internal factors not only make infants and young children prone to pneumonia and are more serious. the immunity of infants under 1 year old is very poor. therefore, pneumonia is easy to spread and spread and spread to both lungs. the age of older and stronger children is gradually becoming more mature and limited. the ability to infect is enhanced, and pneumonia often has larger lesions. if it is limited to one leaf, it is big leaf pneumonia. all pathogens that cause upper respiratory tract infection can induce bronchopneumonia but are mainly bacteria and viruses. among them, streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae rsv is the most common.after the 1990s, the united states and other developed countries were generally vaccinated with haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccine, so the pneumonia caused by haemophilus influenzae has been significantly reduced.most of the bronchial pneumonia is more than 90% of bacterial pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria. other bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa are less common.at least 86 different serotypes of pneumococci are sensitive to penicillin.therefore, the current classification is less common for treatment.the pneumococcal type is the 14th, 18th, 19th, 23rd, and other virulence pneumococcal capsular-containing polysaccharides that are resistant to phagocytosis, while the asymptomatic pneumococcal pathogenic carriers are spreading. infection plays a more important role than pneumonia patients, and the disease is usually sporadic.however, in the group care institutions, there may be epidemic 汕-hemolytic streptococcus, which often causes coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus as a secondary infection in the course of measles or whooping cough. it is a common pathogen of severe pneumonia in children but staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.in recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of pneumonia caused by influenza bacilli, which is often secondary to bronchitis bronchiolitis or sepsis, which is more common before the age of three.pneumonia caused by escherichia coli is mainly seen in newborns and malnourished babies.however, in the case of a large number of antibiotics in recent years, this disease is similar to staphylococcal pneumonia. it can be secondary to other serious diseases. pneumococcal pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia are rare, generally secondary interstitial bronchus. most of the pneumonia is caused by the virus, mainly the adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, measles virus and other measles diseases, often accompanied by bacterial pneumonia, but the measles virus itself can also cause pneumonia, which has been from the early stage of measles pneumonia without bacterial infection. the isolation of measles virus interstitial bronchopneumonia in the lungs of the deceased may also be caused by certain types of m. globosa and m. pneumoniae.","['lung over-inflation', 'heart failure', 'face pale', 'cough more', 'breathing difficulty', 'pleural effusion',

allergic vasculitis,"allergic vasculitis (allergicvasculitis) is a relatively common disease. its histopathology has vascular inflammation of white blood cell nuclear rupture, skin damage, and multiple visceral injuries. this disease has many names. to prevent confusion, ruiter believes this disease is called allergic vasculitis, and this name reflects the inflammatory changes of blood vessels caused by allergies.the disease is of different severity. the lighter lesions can only be recovered in a few weeks. in severe cases, many organs may be damaged or even life-threatening.","the disease is closely related to type iii allergy. for some patients with obvious incentives, it should avoid contact with predisposing factors and prevent the cause.other patients with unclear etiology, in addition to active treatment, need to be strictly screened to find out the cause and take preventive measures. the prevention of allergic skin nodular vasculitis is divided into four aspects: 1. the prevention of the cause by the cause of the disease is the main means to prevent this disease. 2. early diagnosis, early treatment, as far as possible to find the pathogen, to treat the cause. 3. actively participate in outdoor sports, increase your personal physique and improve your immunity. 4. regularly participate in the physical examination of the unit or individual organization, and find that the condition is timely to the hospital.","etiology drug factors present more complex disease risk factors, is generally considered the most common causative drugs barbiturates, phenothiazines, sulfonamides, penicillins, iodides, aspirin and other variant protein and, insecticides, herbicides and petroleum products are also associated with this disease. infection is also an important factor, such as viruses, streptococcus, tuberculosis, leprosy, etc. fungi and protozoa are also considered to be pathogenic factors. bacteria stimulate the blood vessel wall to increase vascular permeability and attract neutral polynuclear leukocytes. immune complex deposition site, causing inflammatory cell infiltration. intrinsic diseases, in addition to intrinsic diseases, such as frozen proteinemia, hyperglobulinemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. can also cause the disease. pathogenesis most of the factors are not directly pathogenic, only streptococcus m protein, mycobacterium tuberculosis, hepatitis b antigens have been shown to have direct pathogenic significance, these three antigens always have an antigen and its corresponding antibody the same way in the same blood vessels, when protein antigens enter the blood circulation, produce specific antibodies, especially igg or igm, antigen-antigens form immune complexes in the bloodstream or in the interstitial space, this complex deposition in the blood vessel wall and surrounding tissues, activation of the body c3 produces anaphylatoxins, causing mast cells to release histamine, increasing vascular permeability, and attracting neutral polynuclear leukocytes to accumulate in the immune complex deposition site, causing inflammatory cell infiltration. immune complexes adhering to the surface of platelets and neutral polynuclear leukocytes, combined with complement to reactivate complement, causing a sequential complement response, causing platelet and neutral polynuclear leukocyte lysis, at which time platelets release coagulation factors and vasoactive substances, causing fibrin deposition and hemorrhage, at this time neutral polynuclear leukocytes release collagenase, elastaseother hydrolytic enzymes which destroy collagen fibers, elastic fibers, basement membrane and surrounding tissue, the blood vessel wall infiltration of inflammatory cells, deposition of fibrin blood vessel wall damage and necrosis, vasculitis causes a variety of symptoms.","['maculopapular rash', 'stationic doctor', 'wind cluster', 'abdominal pain', 'weakness', 'small blood vessel necrosis', 'double vision']",['bleeding blood'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']",['medical treatement']
viral myocarditis,"viral myocarditis (viralmyocarditis) refers to myocardial localized or diffuse acute or chronic inflammatory lesions caused by viral infection, which is an infectious cardiomyopathy.it is a localized or diffuse acute, subacute or chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy associated with viral infection and is the most common infectious myocarditis.the clinical manifestations of mild myocarditis are few and the diagnosis is difficult, so the pathological diagnosis is much higher than the clinical incidence.in the epidemic period of the virus, about 5% of patients develop myocarditis, which can also be scattered, and the clinical manifestations are different.according to the typical history of precursor infection; the corresponding clinical manifestations; electrocardiogram, myocardial injury markers, echocardiographic evidence of myocardial injury, the diagnosis depends on the endocardial myocardial biopsy.there is currently no specific treatment, and the treatment is mainly for viral infection and myocardial inflammation.most patients recover after appropriate treatment, and very few patients die in the acute phase due to severe arrhythmia, acute heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.some patients can evolve into dilated cardiomyopathy.in recent years, with the improvement of detection technology, it has been found that a variety of viruses can cause myocarditis, and its incidence rate is increasing year by year, and it is a common disease and frequently-occurring disease all over the world.","1. correcting the cause and cause of intestinal infection and the relationship between upper respiratory tract infection and viral myocarditis has been relatively clear, so it should be actively prevented, focus on enhancing physical fitness, improve immunity, enterovirus coxsackie b virus (cvb) and cardiomyopathy is the most closely related. therefore, cvb vaccine has important significance in preventing viral myocarditis. inactivated vaccine, synthetic peptide vaccine, genetic engineering vaccine, dna vaccine research and application will be of great significance in preventing the occurrence of viral myocarditis. . 2, pay attention to rest in bed rest is the best way to reduce the heart load, is also an important treatment for the acute phase of viral myocarditis, rest can reduce heart rate, blood pressure, etc. in patients with myocarditis, generally regular full rest for 3 months, half a month for about 3 months severe myocarditis should be strictly rest in bed until the body temperature is normal, ecg and chest x-ray changes return to normal and then gradually get up, strengthen physical exercise, improve the body's disease resistance, avoid fatigue to prevent viruses, bacterial infections, pay attention to rest after the onset, enter nutrition rich diet to help the heart recover. to prevent myocarditis in spring: in recent years, due to the widespread use of antibiotics, the rheumatic fever caused by streptococcal infection has gradually decreased, the incidence of rheumatic myocarditis has decreased significantly, and the incidence of viral myocarditis has increased. viral myocarditis can be caused by various viral infections. among them, coxsackie b virus is the most common, chickenpox, epstein-barr virus can also be caused. according to the study, about 5% of infected people can affect myocarditis in the heart after infection, which can directly affect the myocardium after viral infection. it is caused by autoimmune reaction after viral infection. the former is more common in children, the latter is more common in adolescents, and spring is a high season of viral myocarditis, which should cause people to be vigilant. symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection or intestinal infection, 7-10 days later, chest tightness, palpitations, extreme fatigue, easy sweating and other symptoms. at this time, if you do an electrocardiogram, you may find arrhythmia and myocardial damage in premature beats. esr, myocardial enzyme assay may increase, after 2-4 weeks, the coxsackie virus antibody is detected, and the anti-myocardial antibody may be positive.","almost every group of viruses can cause specific corticoviral diseases. among them, the virus that causes intestinal and upper respiratory tract infections is most common, but many are subclinical. the viruses that have been confirmed to cause myocarditis include: such as yellow fever virus, dengue virus, fever virus, epidemic hemorrhagic fever virus, etc., arbovirus is a group of arthropod vector viruses, which are classified into the togaviridae, the yellow virus family, the bunia virus family and the sand grains. some members of the virus family. the main arboviruses classified as the genus of the togaviridae are the eastern equine encephalitis virus, the western equine encephalitis virus and the venezuelan encephalitis virus, mainly distributed in africa and the americas. japanese encephalitis virus, forest encephalitis virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, st. louis encephalitis virus, and west nile encephalitis virus are classified into the genus flavivirus of the genus togavirus. including hepatitis a, b, c and 汛 hepatitis viruses, hepatitis virus refers to the pathogen causing viral hepatitis. the human hepatitis virus is classified into type a, type b, non-a, b and d viruses. hepatitis a virus is spherical, non-enveloped, and the nucleic acid is single-stranded rna. hepatitis b virus is spherical, has a double-shell structure, and the outer layer is quite a general viral envelope. the nucleic acid is double-stranded dna. non-a, non-b hepatitis and hepatitis d viruses are currently under investigation. it is a serum/genotype 1 virus in the rhabdoviridae lyssavirus, and type 2-6 is called a ""rabies-associated virus"" and is currently only found in africa and europe. rabies virus is a link between wild animals (wolves, foxes, moles, bats, etc.) and domestic animals (dogs, cats, cattle, etc.) and humans. people are mainly infected by diseased animals or poisoned animals. once infected, if effective prevention and treatment measures are not taken in time, it can lead to serious central nervous system acute infectious diseases, and the mortality rate is high. tens of thousands of people die in rabies every year in developing countries in asia, africa and latin america. influenza virus, abbreviated as influenza virus, is an rna virus that causes influenza in people, dogs, horses, pigs and poultry. in taxonomy, influenza virus belongs to the family of positive mucus, which causes acute upper respiratory tract. infection, and through the rapid spread of air, there is often a cyclical pandemic around the world. the virus was first discovered in 1933 by the englishman wilson smith, who called h1n1. h stands for hemagglutinin and n stands for neuraminidase. the numbers represent different types. lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, etc., among the above-mentioned many viruses, coxsackie virus group b type 1 to 5 (especially type 3 most common) and coxsack group a virus 1,4,9,16 and type 23 virus, group b of coxsackie virus is the first pathogen of human myocarditis, according to its classification, the most common in group 2, 4, followed by type 5, 3, 1; group 1, 4, 9, 16 23, each type is easy to invade babies, occasionally invade adult myocardium, viruses of type 6,11,12,16,19,22 and 25 in echovirus, influenza virus, mumps and poliovirus are most common . pathogenesis 1. direct action of the virus in the experiment, the virus can be injected into the blood circulation and can be myocarditis. the virus directly invades the myocardium through the blood flow. the virus itself causes cytolysis. it is also called the viral replication phase. it is the early stage of the virus. the virus actively replicates in the cardiomyocytes and directly acts on the myocardium, causing the myocardium. injury and dysfunction, some people infected the coxsackie b virus for 3 days, it can be found that the myocardium has scattered necrotic lesions, there are obvious inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis after 5-7 days of infection, the virus caused infection after the body receptors mainly rely on the cell membrane of the body, it has been confirmed that the receptor of coxsackie b virus is located on human chromosome 19, because coxsackie virus b, type a receptor exists on the human myocardial cell membrane, it can translate this kind of virus information, so this kind of virus can proliferate and replicate in cardiomyocytes, leading to myocardial damage. in addition, the virus may also produce toxins locally, resulting in myocardial fiber dissolution, necrosis, edema and inflammatory cell infiltration. most scholars believe that acute fulminant viral myocarditis and viral death within 1 to 2 weeks of sudden death, the virus directly invades the myocardium, myocardial damage may be the main pathogenesis, based on the fact that the virus is found in the myocardium from the autopsy. inoculation of the virus by myocardial isolation may cause the disease, and the titer of the neutralizing antibody of the same virus in the serum is increased, in addition, in the acute during the period, mainly within 9 days of onset, the virus can be isolated from the myocardium of the patient or animal, the virus fluorescent antibody test results are positive, or virus particles are found during electron microscopy. second, the immune response for most viral myocarditis, especially chronic myocarditis, is currently believed to cause disease mainly through immune allergies, experimental and human viral myocarditis after 9 days of onset can no longer find the virus in the myocardium, but myocarditis continues it indicates that the immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis. some patients have mild symptoms of viral infection and myocarditis is quite serious. in some cases, the symptoms of myocarditis appear after the beginning of other symptoms of viral infection, and some patients may have myocardium. the discovery of antigen-antibody complexes, all of which suggest the existence of immune mechanisms, the mouse cardiomyocytes infected with a small amount of coxsackie virus in the experiment, the cytotoxicity is not significant, such as the addition of the same kind of immune spleen cells, the cytotoxicity is enhanced, such as when the spleen cells were treated with anti-thoracic antibodies and complement, the cytotoxicity was not enhanced. if the spleen cells were treated with coxsackie b antibody and complement in advance, the cytotoxicity was increased.experiments show that there is a cell-mediated immune mechanism in viral myocarditis. the study also suggests that cytotoxicity is mainly mediated by t lymphocytes. clinically, viral myocarditis prolongs unhealed, e-flowered, lymphocyte transformation rate, complement c it is lower than normal, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-myocardial antibody and anti-complement are higher than normal, indicating that the immune function is low in viral myocarditis. recently, the activity of natural killer cells and alpha interferon were found in viral myocarditis. it was also significantly lower than normal, gamma interferon was higher than normal, and it also reflected the loss of cellular immunity. in mice, experimental myocarditis increased the severity of the disease and increased mortality after the immunosuppressant cyclosporine a. after 1 week of infection, administration reduces mortality.","['resident doctor', 'muscle soreness', 'heart palpitations with weight loss, diarrhea', 'fever', 'heart skipping speed',

sick sinus syndrome,"sick sinus syndrome (sss) is referred to as sick sinus syndrome or sick sinus. sick sinus syndrome is due to the sinus node or surrounding tissues (including atrial, atrioventricular junction, etc.) sexual lesions, leading to dysfunction of sinus node impulse, or a variety of arrhythmias and multiple symptoms caused by sinus node to atrial impulse conduction disorder, mainly sinus bradycardia, sinus conduction block, sinus sexual arrest is the main cause, when combined with recurrent tachyarrhythmia, it is called bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome.symptoms appear more than 40 years old.the main causes are: idiopathic sclerosis-degeneration, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, surgical injury, hypertension, etc.clinical manifestations: insidious onset, slow progress, sometimes accidentally discovered.may last or intermittently.when there is a high degree of sinus block or sinus arrest, a short burst of syncope or sputum may occur.occasionally, angina, heart failure or shock can occur.acute inferior myocardial infarction and myocarditis can cause temporary sinus node dysfunction, and the acute phase disappears after the past.","sick sinus syndrome is often caused by degenerative lesions or fibrosis of the sinoatrial node and its surrounding tissues. it should actively find the cause, symptomatic treatment, and prevent further development of the disease. if the heart rate is too slow, the artificial cardiac pacemaker can be placed. maintain normal life and work. 1. active treatment of primary disease: eliminate the basic causes, such as active treatment of myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction and myocardial ischemia, restore electrolyte balance; eliminate the cause of the disease, after the disease should adhere to the doctor's advice, consolidate the effect, avoid adverse stimulation . 2. use or disable various drugs that inhibit sinus node function: such as 汕-blockers, verapamil, digitalis, and other antiarrhythmic drugs. 3. the daily life is regular, the diet is appropriate, and exercise properly to prevent the invasion of external evils. 4. acute sinus node dysfunction should be treated with active etiology, temporarily increase the sinus heart rate, so as not to evolve into chronic sick sinus syndrome; for the diagnosis of chronic sinus syndrome should be actively taken comprehensive treatment of traditional chinese and western medicine to improve the sinus if the function of the ablation is to block the further development of the disease, if the drug treatment is poor or the clinical symptoms are obvious, the pacemaker should be installed early to prevent sudden death.","1 anti-arrhythmia drugs. such as quinidine, procainamide, propiamine, propafenone, encarni, flecainide, etc. are membrane inhibitors, can inhibit the pacing autonomic sinus node, can also inhibit the atrioventricular junction the function of the secondary pacing point is that when the above drugs are used in patients with sick sinus syndrome, the sinus node function can be inhibited, the sinus node recovery time (snrt) is prolonged and sinus arrest occurs, sinus bradycardia. 2 digitalis drugs: in most cases, digitalis can shorten the recovery time of sinoatrial node, and it can be prolonged. in most cases, medication is safe, and a small number of patients will aggravate the degree of sinus bradycardia. heart rhythm changes should be closely observed when rehmannia. 3 antihypertensive drugs: such as lishepine, guanethidine, clonidine, etc. can slow heart rate. 4 other drugs: such as antidepressants: amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, lithium carbonate, etc., can also slow heart rate. is the most common cause, except for the sinus node and its adjacent tissues, the rest of the cardiac conduction system, such as the atrioventricular node, his bundle and bundle branch system, can also be involved, causing multiple potential pacing and conduction dysfunction lead to the so-called total conduction system disease, with the gradual fibrosis of the sinoatrial node with age, the pacemaker cells are replaced by fibrous tissue, the normal function of the sinus node is gradually lost, and the ventricular pacing or conduction dysfunction is complicated. , also known as double-junction lesions; at the same time involving the left and right bundle branches called the full conduction system lesions. coronary heart disease: mainly for vascular ischemia or sclerotherapy of sinus node, coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sick sinus syndrome, but foreign pathological anatomy reports that there are 2 / 3 sinus of patients with sick sinus syndrome the vessel blood vessels are normal. some cases have sinus node arterial ischemia. the cause is thromboembolism caused by coronary heart disease. it can also cause sinus node ischemia caused by vascular wall lesions in some immune diseases. both sick sinus syndrome and coronary heart disease coexist. cardiomyopathy is also more common in the etiology of sick sinus syndrome. according to foreign reports, the incidence rate is about 16.4%, according to the domestic reported incidence of 13.9%; acute myocardial infarction or ischemia. acute heart inflammation, valvular and structural lesions can cause this disease; the incidence of myocarditis according to foreign reports is 5.3%, according to the domestic reported incidence of 4.0%, including viral, bacterial myocarditis, etc.; myocardial metabolism or invasive lesions: myocardial amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, malignant tumors. systemic immune diseases: such as rheumatic carditis, rheumatic heart disease (incidence rate 5.8% to 6.4%), systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.; congenital diseases: congenital heart disease, familial qt prolongation syndrome, familial sick sinus syndrome, familial congenital sinus node dysplasia, friedreich hereditary ataxia, progressive muscular atrophy, muscular dystrophy, etc.; keshan disease, hypertensive heart disease, pericarditis, syphilis sexual heart disease, mitral valve prolapse syndrome; hyperthyroidism, diabetic cardiomyopathy and mediastinal radiation therapy. direct surgical injury, such as open heart surgery, myocardial catheterization can also damage the sinus node and surrounding tissues. pathogenesis: the incidence of familial sick sinus syndrome is not high, only a minority of sick sinus syndrome, due to structural abnormalities of congenital sinus node. due to the different etiology of pathological sinus syndrome, the location and extent of pathological damage are different, and the mechanism is different. there are the following: 1. the effects of self-discipline, conductivity and excitability on sinus node tissue cells. 2. the occurrence of sick sinus syndrome is related to the autophysiological characteristics of sinus node. 3. the occurrence of sick sinus syndrome is related to the blood supply of sinus node. 4. sick sinus syndrome results in sinus blockage due to sinus node activation and dysfunction. 5. the vagus nerve is hyperactive. 6. sick sinus syndrome is an adenosine-mediated disease. 1 antiarrhythmic drugs are divided into four categories according to their effects: class i antiarrhythmic drugs: such as quinidine, procainamide, propiamine, propafenone, encarni, flecainide, etc. are membrane inhibition the agent can inhibit the pacing autonomicity of the sinus node and also inhibit the function of the secondary pacing point in the atrioventricular junction. when the above drugs are used in patients with sick sinus syndrome, the sinus node function can be inhibited. increased sinus node recovery time (snrt) and sinus arrest, sinus bradycardia. class ii antiarrhythmic drugs: such as 汕-adrenergic blockers, can inhibit the self-discipline of patients with sick sinus syndrome, prolong the recovery time of sinus node, and sinus block. class iii antiarrhythmic drugs: such as amiodarone, sotalol, can directly act on the sinus node cell membrane to inhibit its membrane potential, and can inhibit the activity of sympathetic nerves. class iv antiarrhythmic drugs: such as calcium ion antagonists: verapamil, diltiazem, nitrile ore, application of blockade of ca2 channel drugs, may inhibit the action potential spontaneous diastolic depolarization of sinus node cells, and sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, etc. 2 digitalis drugs: in most cases, digitalis can shorten the recovery time of sinoatrial node, and it can be prolonged. in most cases, medication is safe, and a small number of patients will aggravate the degree of sinus bradycardia. heart rhythm changes should be closely observed when rehmannia. 3 antihypertensive drugs: such as lishepine, guanethidine, clonidine, etc. can slow heart rate. 4 other drugs: such as antidepressants: amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, lithium carbonate, etc., can also slow heart rate.

kawasaki disease,"kawasakidiseaes (kd), first reported by kawasaki fusaku in japan in 1967, was once known as the skin mucosal lymph node syndrome, which occurs in all countries of the world. it has the highest incidence in asian populations, and can occur in all seasons. more common in infants and young children.china's epidemiological survey shows that the incidence of children under five years old in beijing from 2000 to 2004 was 49.4/100,000. the pathogenesis is still unclear. the main pathological changes are systemic vasculitis, which occurs in the coronary arteries.for self-limiting diseases, most prognosis is good, with a recurrence rate of 1% to 2%.","as for the extent to which the baby is good enough to go to a nursery school or kindergarten, there is no special rule. as long as the baby has no special discomfort, he can return to normal life. generally speaking, kawasaki disease will not recur in the future, but the heart disease is affected by the sequelae. it will appear after many years, so it is necessary to have a regular heart check. infants and children with this disease can be ill, but 80 to 85% of patients are within 5 years of age, and occur in infants between 6 and 18 months. there are more boys, males and females are 1.3 to 1.5:1, with no obvious seasonality. or more summer, there were about 100,000 cases of kawasaki disease in japan until 1990, and three epidemics occurred in 1979, 1982, and 1986. the prevalence of children within 4 years of age was 172-194/100,000. although the number of reports in the world is not as good as that in japan, it is north to sweden, the netherlands, the united states, canada, the united kingdom, south korea, south africa, australia, singapore, etc., and china has first since beijing, shanghai, hangzhou, and rong in 1978. and taiwan and other places reported a small number of cases, in 1989, ""practical pediatrics"" comprehensive 220 cases, the source throughout the country, 1983-1986 national major children's hospitals and medical schools affiliated hospitals communication survey, a total of 965 hospitalized cases, 1987 ~ 1991 in the second survey of the year, the number of hospitalized cases increased to 1969, and the annual increase trend, 78.1% of patients within 4 years old, male: 1.6:1 for women, more japanese in the us cases, japan reported sibling incidence 1 ~2%, suggesting genetic tilt. the vast majority of children have a good prognosis, self-limiting, and appropriate treatment can gradually recover, which is very different from infant-type nodular arteritis, but 15 to 30% of patients with kawasaki disease can develop coronary aneurysms, due to coronary aneurysm, thromboembolism or myocarditis, accounted for 1-2% of all cases, even in the recovery period can be sudden death, the number of ischemic heart disease is very small, about 2% recurrence the mortality rate has dropped to 0.5% to 1.0% in recent years. the death causes of 104 cases of kawasaki disease in japan, 57% of myocardial infarction, 12% of heart failure, 6.7% of myocardial infarction with heart failure, 5% of coronary aneurysm rupture, arrhythmia 1 %, other patients have concurrent infections, beijing children's hospital since 1986 applied two-dimensional echocardiography to examine 188 cases of kawasaki disease, 60 cases of coronary artery disease were detected, including 44 cases of expansion, 16 cases of aneurysm, after follow-up for 3 months ~5 years, an average of 22.6 months, 40 cases of normal recovery, the latter 6 cases, the normal recovery time was 4.4 I 2.9 months and 15.7 I 17.2 months, 2 cases of death, 1 case of multiple moderate coronary aneurysms (inner diameter 7mm) acute anterior myocardial infarction , and the other cases were multiple juliu, cracking occurs in the course of the right coronary artery for 28 days.","the cause is not clear, the disease is a certain epidemic and landlord, clinical manifestations of fever, rash, etc., presumably related to infection, generally believed to be a variety of pathogens, including epstein-barr virus, retrovirus (retrovirus), or streptococci, propionibacterium infection, reported in 1986, the peripheral blood lymphocyte culture supernatant increased the activity of reverse transcriptase, suggesting that the disease may be caused by retrovirus, but most studies have not obtained consistent results, and have previously proposed mycoplasma, rickettsia, dust mite is the pathogen of this disease, and it has not been confirmed. some people think that environmental pollution or chemical allergy may be the cause of the disease. recent studies have shown that the disease has obvious immune disorders in the acute phase, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis. in the acute phase, peripheral blood t cell subsets are imbalanced, cd4 is increased, cd8 is decreased, cd4/cd8 ratio is increased, and this change is in lesion 3~ the most obvious 5 weeks, return to normal after 8 weeks, the cd4/cd8 ratio increased, the body's immune system is activated, cd4 secreted lymphokines increased, promote b cell polyclonal water activation, proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells, leading to serum igm , iga, igg, elevated ige, activated t cells secrete high concentrations of interleukins (1l-1, 4, 5, 6), r-interferon (ifn-r), tumor necrosis factor (tnf), these lymphocytes factor, activin can induce endothelial cell expression and produce new antigen; on the other hand, it promotes b cell secretion of autoantibodies, which leads to cytotoxicity of endothelial cells, vascular inflammation caused by endothelial cell damage, 1l-11l-6, increased tnf can induce hepatocytes to synthesize acute reactive proteins, such as c-reactive protein, 汐r-antitrypsin, and haptoglobin, which cause acute fever in this disease. (cic) increased, 50 to 70% of cases were not available in the first week of the disease, and reached the peak in the third to fourth week. the mechanism of action of cic in this disease is still unclear, but there is no immune complex deposition in the lesion. the serum c3 does not decrease but rises, which is not in line with the general immune complex disease. the triggering cause of the above immune disorder is unknown. today, kawasaki disease is considered to be an immune-mediated systemicity triggered by a host susceptible to various infectious agents. vasculitis.","['characteristic toe-end large-scale peeling', 'upper limb edema', 'maocary rash', 'stationic medicine', 'lip-redness', 'nail visible transverse groove spinning', 'pulse acceleration', 'continuous fever ', 'hip cleft palate', 'tachycardia', 'ankle and foot edema']",['myocarditis'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
penetrating heart trauma,"penetrating heart trauma is caused by a strong, high-speed, sharp foreign body penetrating the chest wall or entering the heart. a few cases are caused by violent displacement of the sternum or rib fracture. the heart penetrating wound has pericardial damage. sometimes there are many heart wounds, which are especially common in stab wounds and gunshot wounds.the site of cardiac permeation was most common in the right ventricle (about 47%), followed by the left ventricle (34%), the right atrium (14%), and the left atrium (10%).the pathological changes of cardiac penetrating injury depend on the location of the lesion and the size of the breach, and the extent of pericardial injury.pericardial hemorrhage and functional damage caused by rupture of the left ventricle, the lesion is more severe than the right ventricle and worse.","factors affecting the prognosis of penetrating cardiac trauma include: anatomical and physiological factors after injury, clinical type and staging effects, and medical interventions. therefore, comprehensive consideration should be given to the treatment of this disease, and efforts should be made to make the most suitable treatment plan for patients in a timely manner.","the causes of this disease are as follows: 1. high-speed foreign body damage caused by high-speed foreign bodies usually refers to bullets, shrapnel, sharp knives and other high-speed sharp foreign objects penetrate the chest wall injury and pericardium, caused by the heart, which is especially common in wartime, it is also common in common times that such injuries often occur simultaneously with chest and abdominal trauma, and are the most common cause of penetrating heart injury. 2. the rupture of the sternum or rib fracture is severely inward. the damage caused by penetrating the heart is mostly caused by traffic accidents or industrial accidents. 3. penetrating heart injury caused by other causes cardiac catheterization, interventional cardiac therapy, pericardial puncture and esophageal foreign body can cause heart penetrating injury, and occasionally the rib fixed steel needle displacement causes heart damage. heart penetrating injuries are difficult to estimate accurately. many critically ill patients have died before the visit. only about half of the stab wounds and 15% to 20% of gunshot wounds can reach medical institutions.","['myocardial ischemia', 'shock', 'blood pressure drop', 'internal bleeding', 'pericardial bleeding', 'pericardial damage', 'heart stiffness', 'griesinger-kussmaul sign', 'pulse fine speed']",['ascites'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
sinus arrest,"sinusarrest (sinusarrest), also known as sinusstandstill (sinusstandstill), sinus intermittent, sinus pause, etc., refers to the sinus node to stop giving excitement within a certain period of time.according to the cardiac pacemaker stop, it can be divided into sinus arrest, atrial arrest, junctional regional arrest, ventricular arrest, whole heart arrest, clinical cardiac arrest (cardiac arrest), ventricle stopping and sinus arrest are the most important.according to the reasons of the arrest, it can be divided into two types: primary sinus arrest and secondary sinus arrest.according to the time of the stroke, it can be divided into three types: short pause, longer stop, and permanent stop.","regularly use the instrument to detect heart rate, pay attention to changes in related indicators and symptoms, promptly seek medical treatment, and actively treat arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, myocarditis and other primary diseases.correct electrolyte imbalance and rational use of related drugs.prevent fatigue, stress, alcohol and tobacco stimulation.","causes of cardiac priming sinus arrest is more common, mainly due to damage to the sinus node itself, mostly caused by organic heart disease, such as coronary heart disease, acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, sick sinus synthesis the sign of frequent death is the pre-dying performance of various diseases in the late stage.in addition, cardiac trauma or cardiac surgery can damage the sinus node, sinus arrest can occur during or after surgery, and coronary angiography can also lead to sinus arrest. sinus node pacemaker cells can inhibit the electrophysiological properties ofsinus node pacemaker cells by inhibitinginflammation, fibrosis, degeneration, etc., causing their self-discipline to be temporarily or permanently lost. it belongs to level 0 and has sinus arrest. arrhythmia secondary to transient sinus arrest (2 to 4 s) after various tachyarrhythmia: most common in supraventricular tachycardia, after stimulation of the vagus nerve and drug therapy or over-speed suppression of esophageal pacing, the sinus arrest that occurs when the supraventricular tachycardia is suddenly corrected is mostly transient. drug factors antiarrhythmia drug overdose or poisoning can cause sinus arrest: such as digitalis, quinidine, reserpine, amiodarone, etc., recently there are propafenone (heart rhythm), moresiazine, fluoride card case reports of sinus arrest caused by anitropin and adenosine triphosphate (atp). other factors such as increased vagal tone or carotid sinus allergy, inhibition of sinus node function caused by sinus arrest: for example, oppression of the eyeball, massage of the carotid sinus, stimulation of the pharynx, tracheal intubation, etc., normal people can sometimes occur.hyperkalemia, hypokalemia can also cause sinus arrest.","['amaurosis', 'consciousness disorder', 'syncope']",['a-s syndrome'],"['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
single ventricle,"a single ventricle, or common ventricle or univentricular heart, is a rare congenital malformation defined as two atriums that pass through only the bilateral atrioventricular valve or common atrioventricular valve. ventricular.the malformation of the atrium can be consistent with the connection of the ventricle or ventricle to the aorta. the incidence is about 1:6500 in live infants, about 1.5% of congenital heart disease, and the ventricles receive both tricuspid and mitral valves. the blood of the common atrioventricular valve.anderson divides the single ventricle into three types: the left ventricle (63%-80%) and the dysplastic right ventricle; the right ventricle, less (5%), and the dysplasia of the left ventricle.unshaped (accounting for 75), two ventricles without interventricular septum, also known as the common ventricle.each type can be divided into three subtypes: normal aorta, right aorta transposition, and left aorta transposition.the prognosis of the single ventricle is poor, mostly due to congestive heart failure, arrhythmia and sudden death.","most single-ventricular patients have obvious congenital heart disease in early years, such as purpura, tachycardia or slow weight gain, which attracts attention in early neonates or infants. for patients with more pulmonary blood, there are often no early cases. the natural lifespan of single-ventricular patients was found to be short without treatment. according to the toronto children's hospital, 117 (64%) of the 182 deaths, 50% died within 1 month after birth, and 74% died. 6 months, moodie et al analyzed 83 patients who had not undergone surgery and most of them had passed the infancy. from the date of diagnosis, 50% of type a patients died on average within 14 years, and type c patients had a worse prognosis, 50%. after 4 years of death, the presence or absence of pulmonary stenosis does not affect the length of life. the cause of death is mainly congestive heart failure and arrhythmia, or sudden death due to unknown causes.","etiology: from the basis of embryology, the formation of a single ventricle is due to the failure of the atrioventricular tube to correctly align with the developing ventricle, so that both atrioventricular valves are facing a ventricle, often complicated by obstruction of the pulmonary valve. this may be due to the deviation of the funnel spacing. pathological changes: the single ventricle itself can be divided into many subtypes. van praagh et al. classify them into four types according to the morphology of the ventricle: a, the morphological left ventricle with the original outflow tract including the right ventricular funnel. type b, morphologically right ventricle without left ventricular sinus (the left ventricular remnant can be a non-functional fissure or pocket); type c, ventricle including the left and right ventricles, no part interval or only its remnant; d type, ventricle does not have right ventricular or left ventricular features (no right ventricle and left ventricular sinus), these four types can be further based on their connection with the aorta and the location of the aorta space, will they are divided into i (normal), ii (right) or iii (left), according to van praagh, type a accounts for 78%, type b accounts for 5%, type c for 7%, and type d for 10%; in the case of large blood vessel translocation, the number of right or left iliac crests was similar, with 42% and 43% respectively, and 15% of the aorta was normally aligned.","['heart failure', 'purple', 'systolic murmur', 'skull finger (toe)', 'arrhythmia', 'tachycardia', 'wasting']",[],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']",['surgical treatment']
single atrium,"single atrial is a rare congenital heart disease caused by the absence of the first and second compartments of the interventricular septum during embryonic development.the traces of the room are also not present, and the compartment is complete, so it is also called the two-chamber three-chamber heart or the single-atrial three-chamber heart.single atrium can exist alone, but often combined with the left superior vena cava and right heart, left heart or abdominal visceral transposition malformation, especially the anterior mitral lobes, and even the atrioventricular tube malformation.the single atrium is similar to the large atrial septal defect and the atrioventricular pathway. if the pulmonary vascular resistance is normal, the left to right shunt is dominant.if the pulmonary vascular resistance is increased, a two-way shunt is generated, and the blood oxygen saturation of the body arteries is lowered.lack of fatigue, palpitations, shortness of breath, and prone to respiratory infections.poor growth and development, mild purpura or obvious after activity, clubbing (toe), heart failure is less common.the left sternal border has systolic murmurs, and the second heart sounds hyperthyroidism.the apical area heard the full systolic murmur of the hair styling, which was caused by the anterior flap of the mitral valve.the heart is moderately or significantly enlarged, and the anterior region of the heart can have a sense of lift.","the disease is a congenital disease, so there is no effective preventive measure, but for children with a clear diagnosis, as long as serious pulmonary vascular obstructive disease has not occurred, early surgery should be sought.","etiology: this disease is a congenital disease. it is due to the development of the single-chamber heart embryo. the first septum and the second septum of the interatrial septum are not developed, resulting in the formation of a common atrium, so it is also called the two-chamber three-chamber heart or single atrial three-chamber heart. pathological changes: the venous and venous blood from the vena cava and the pulmonary veins are mixed in a single atrium. because the right ventricular filling resistance is small, most of the blood enters the left ventricle, and the pulmonary veins return to the blood flow in the atria. only a part of the blood flows through the mitral valve. the ventricle re-enters the systemic circulation, so purpura can appear clinically. the blood oxygen saturation in the ventricle, aorta and pulmonary artery is almost the same on both sides of the atrium. the single-atrial venous venous drainage is more common, such as the left superior vena cava. the left side of the sinus or common atrium, followed by the inferior vena cava through the azygous or semi-singular vein drainage and the hepatic vein directly into the right side of the common atrium, forming a mixed blood in the atria.","['heart failure', 'purple', 'systolic murmur', 'skull finger (toe)', 'gas rush']",['brain embolism'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']",['surgical treatment']

(2) hyperthyroidism: most hyperthyroidism patients have sinus tachycardia, heart rate is generally 100 ~ 120 times / min, severe heart rate can reach 120 ~ 140 times / min. (3) acute myocardial infarction: in the course of acute myocardial infarction, the incidence of sinus tachycardia can reach 30% to 40%. (4) shock: shock can cause sinus tachycardia, heart rate can reach 100 beats / min or more in mild shock; heart rate is faster in severe shock, can be greater than 120 beats / min. (5) acute myocarditis: most patients may have sinus tachycardia that is not proportional to the increase in body temperature. (6) other organic heart disease: sinus tachycardia can occur. (7) anemia, fever, infection, hypoxia, autonomic dysfunction, sinus tachycardia can occur after cardiac surgery. (8) drugs: such as adrenaline, atropine can also cause sinus tachycardia. (ii) pathogenesis the occurrence of sinus tachycardia is mainly related to sympathetic excitation and vagal tone reduction. when sympathetic excitation affects sinus node pacemaker cells, the 4-phase ascending velocity increases, the threshold potential time is shortened, and the heart rate is accelerate. 1. physiological factors physiological sinus tachycardia is an ""adaptation"" phenomenon, which affects many factors such as normal human activity, emotional agitation, full meal, drinking tea, coffee; smoking, drinking, etc. can make sympathetic nerves excitement, rapid heartbeat, body position changes such as sympathetic excitation, heart rate is also accelerated; heart rate is slowed when lying, physiological factors caused by sinus tachycardia is often transient, short duration. 2. pathological factors (1) heart failure: in heart failure, heart rate tends to increase, which is one of the compensatory mechanisms for the body to maintain cardiac output. heart rate in patients with heart failure is compensated within a certain range. (2) hyperthyroidism: most patients with hyperthyroidism have sinus tachycardia. (3) acute myocardial infarction: the incidence of sinus tachycardia is higher in the course of acute myocardial infarction. this is due to the systemic stress response, increased catecholamine secretion, pain, tension, and insufficient blood volume in the early stage of the disease. or concurrent infection, fever and other factors, such as persistent sinus tachycardia is a large infarct size, decreased cardiac output, left heart failure or necrosis, poor myocardial healing and repair. (4) shock: the degree of sinus tachycardia is often used as one of the indicators of the severity of shock.

the vascular lumen.the clinical symptoms vary depending on the number and extent of coronary stenosis. the etiology of this disease has not yet been fully understood, but it is thought to be related to hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperviscosity, diabetes, endocrine function and age. in addition to age, lipid metabolism disorders are the most important predictors of coronary heart disease.there is a close relationship between total cholesterol (tc) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldlc) levels and the risk of coronary heart disease events.for every 1% increase in ldlc levels, the risk of coronary heart disease increases by 2-3%. triglyceride (tg) is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease, often accompanied by low hdlc and impaired glucose tolerance, the latter two are also crowns risk factors for heart disease. hypertension is closely related to the formation and development of coronary atherosclerosis.systolic blood pressure is more predictive of coronary heart disease than diastolic blood pressure.the systolic blood pressure of 140-149 mmhg is more likely to increase the risk of death from coronary heart disease than the diastolic blood pressure of 90-94 mmhg. after 40 years of age, the incidence of coronary heart disease is higher. the premenopausal incidence rate of women is lower than that of men, and it is equal to men after menopause.

acquired tricuspid regurgitation,"acquired tricuspid regurgitation is divided into two types: relative and organic. in the opposite case, the valve itself has no lesions. it is due to right ventricular hypertrophy and corresponding expansion of the atrioventricular ring, causing misalignment of the tricuspid valve leaflets. patients with severe regurgitation, severe rheumatic heart disease, mitral stenosis or regurgitation are often associated with relative tricuspid regurgitation.organic tricuspid regurgitation is a sequela of rheumatic fever. the pathological changes are thickening of the valve fibers, curling, shortening of the chordae, enlargement of the annulus, and inability of the valve to completely align when the heart contracts, often with the fusion of the valve junction. consolidation is narrow.acquired simple tricuspid regurgitation can occur in carcinoid syndrome, because carcinoid plaque often sinks on the ventricular surface of the tricuspid valve and causes the tip of the valve to adhere to the right ventricular wall, causing tricuspid regurgitation. most of these patients have pulmonary valve disease at the same time.relative to the degree of tricuspid regurgitation, after correction of other primary valvular lesions, after a period of recovery, due to the decline of right ventricular pressure, the right heart is reduced, and the degree of insufficiency is mostly reduced or even disappeared.however, in some patients with severe rheumatic heart disease, hemodynamic disturbance caused by tricuspid regurgitation within a few days after surgery is one of the factors that contribute to low cardiac output and lead to surgical death.","for certain diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension, mitral valve disease, pulmonary valve or funnel stenosis, right ventricular myocardial infarction, etc. or should always be alert and prevent functional tricuspid regurgitation; and in other diseases such as ebstein malformations and common atrioventricular pathways in congenital anomalies, and some acquired lesions such as rheumatic inflammation, tricuspid papillary muscle dysfunction caused by coronary lesions, trauma and infective endocarditis, etc. the appearance of tricuspid regurgitation occurs.","acquired simple tricuspid regurgitation can occur in carcinoid syndrome, because carcinoid plaque often sinks on the ventricular surface of the tricuspid valve and causes the tip of the valve to adhere to the right ventricular wall, causing tricuspid regurgitation. most of these patients have pulmonary valve disease at the same time, and the right heart is obviously enlarged when the tricuspid regurgitation is incomplete. the pathophysiology of tricuspid regurgitation is the result of tricuspid regurgitation, that is, systolic blood flow from the right ventricle back into the right atrium, resulting in enlarged right atrium, increased pressure, venous return, due to increased right ventricular load , compensatory and hypertrophic, prone to right heart failure.","['tricuspid lower shift', 'right heart failure', 'tiredness', 'lower abdominal pain', 'jugular vein anger', 'systolic murmur', 'hepatomegaly', 'increased pacing frequency' ]",['pulmonary embolism'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
acquired arteriovenous fistula,"there is an abnormal channel between the artery and the vein called the arteriovenous fistula.acquired arteriovenous fistula is caused by trauma, etc., and can also be caused by rupture of aneurysm. due to the normal blood flow into the accompanying vein, arterial blood can cause local vasculopathy and local, peripheral circulation and systemic hemodynamic changes.","this disease is caused by trauma, so there is no effective preventive measures, but for some iatrogenic injuries such as splenectomy and nephrectomy, large ligation of spleen and kidney pedicle; femoral artery ligation during amputation; thyroidectomy requires medical care the personnel were carefully examined after surgery to prevent the occurrence of arteriovenous fistula.","(1) causes of the disease trauma is the main cause of acquired arteriovenous fistula, especially penetrating wounds, such as knife stab wounds, gunshot wounds, steel and glass fragments flying wounds, etc. the most common injuries and injuries in the same sheath are injured. the arteriovenous fistula is established by abnormal passages of the arteries and veins. trauma is also a common cause during percutaneous transluminal angiography and surgery. generally, the external penetrating wound is small, and adjacent muscles and soft tissues prevent blood outflow and form in local soft tissue. hematoma, hematoma formation after the formation of arteriovenous wall, traumatic arteriovenous fistula caused by firearms such as shotguns, grenades, etc., there may be multiple fistulas between arteries and veins, crush injury can also cause arteriovenous fistula, such as spleen, when nephrectomy, spleen pedicle, large ligation of renal pedicle can occur arteriovenous fistula, shoulder, hip contusion can cause local arteriovenous fistula. other causes of arteriovenous fistula are rare, spontaneous aneurysm hardening gradually adheres, corrosion finally penetrates the accompanying vein; bacterial arteritis, bacteria staying at the bifurcation of the artery cause arterial perforation and access to the accompanying vein, arteriovenous fistulas may occur. (1) penetrating injury the vast majority of acquired arteriovenous fistulas are caused by penetrating injuries, such as various puncture wounds, especially high-speed bullets, sodium iron and glass fragments. at the time of injury, the arteries and veins in the same sheath are damaged together. fractures are the most common cause of percutaneous angiography and surgery because of sharp fractures or broken bones. the fourth and fifth lumbar intervertebral discs are close to the iliac vessels. vascular injury causes aortic venous fistula. generally, the external orifice of the penetrating wound is small. the adjacent muscles and soft tissues prevent a large amount of bleeding, and a hematoma is formed in the local soft tissue. after the hematoma is formed, the wall of the arteriovenous fistula is formed. (2) crush injury parallel arterial and venous compressions can occur with arteriovenous fistula, iatrogenic injury such as splenectomy and nephrectomy, massive ligation of spleen and renal pedicle; femoral artery and vein ligation during amputation; upper extremity arteriovenous during thyroidectomy large ligation, can occur arteriovenous fistula, external violence on soft tissue, soft tissue squeezed on the bone, such as the shoulder, buttocks can cause local arteriovenous fistula, skull fracture can cause arteriovenous fistula of meningeal blood vessels, etc. . (3) other reasons aneurysms gradually develop adhesions, corrosion, and finally break through the accompanying veins, and even arteriovenous fistulas can occur when tumor ulcers break into large blood vessel walls. (two) pathogenesis 1. the site of occurrence traumatic arteriovenous fistula mainly occurs in the extremities, the lower extremities are more common than the upper extremities, and the lower extremity femoral arteries and veins are more common than the deep femoral arteries. among the 27 cases reported by zhang peihua, the lower extremities accounted for 41% (8 cases of superficial arteriovenous fistula, 1 case of deep arteriovenous), upper limbs accounted for 33%, other parts accounted for 26% (such as common carotid artery - innominate vein, internal carotid artery - internal jugular vein, external carotid artery - facial vein, internal mammary artery - innominate vein, shallow arteries and veins, forehead veins, etc.). 2. pathology in most patients, the distance between the artery and the vein can be quite small. the sacral branch only includes the adjacent vessel wall. in some patients, the fibrotic duct can separate the venous and venous, and the arteriovenous fistula often has a pseudoaneurysm, especially the trauma. to that, elkin and shumacker analyzed a group of 195 cases of traumatic arteriovenous fistula, 60% with pseudoaneurysm, most of the pseudoaneurysms were placed between the arteries and veins, and the rest could be separated from the iliac veins at different sites. or on it. acquired arteriovenous fistula is almost a single branch, and most of the symptoms and signs are related to the ""short circuit"" between the high-pressure arterial system and the low-pressure venous system. the degree and location of the lesion determine its pathophysiological changes. typical lateral-lateral or ""h""-type arteriovenous fistulas have proximal and distal arteries and veins that are connected by a lateral branch, forming a peripheral vascular bed, draining the arteriovenous via the distal end of the fistula, and nourishing the blood vessels. and the drainage branch constitutes a complete circulation path. (1) mouth resistance: the role of arteriovenous fistula (local, peripheral and central) is related to hemodynamic resistance. the larger the diameter of the fistula, the shorter the resistance, the smaller the resistance; the diameter of the fistula is small and the length is short. the resistance is relatively high. however, when the diameter reaches a certain level, compared with other factors such as the branching pathway, the resistance is not significant. at the same diameter, the resistance of the h-type arteriovenous fistula is higher than that of the lateral-lateral arteriovenous fistula. when multiple branches coexist, the combined force of the parallel branches is equal to the resultant force of the interaction of the resistances, which must be less than the resistance of the minimum resistance, and the combined force of the two parallel branches of the same diameter is equal to half of the resistance of the single branch. although the blood flow through the two branches can be increased, it is rare to increase by a multiple. (2) local effects: 1 blood flow: the proximal arterial blood flow can be increased, the size of the fistula is the main determinant, in addition, the venous outflow tract resistance, the arterial collateral circulation and the peripheral vascular bed also play a role, the presence of the fistula can significantly reduce the proximal arterial resistance the blood flow during diastole is greatly increased, sometimes reaching 80% to 90% of the maximum blood flow during systole. this blood flow phase is significantly different from the normal peripheral arteries. at rest, the normal arterial blood flow drops during the diastolic phase. 0, often maintained for a period of time, therefore, the presence of the fistula not only increases the velocity of the proximal arterial blood flow, but also reduces its pulsation. proximal venous blood flow is greatly increased and more pulsating, peak blood flow rate is consistent with arterial contraction, due to large venous compliance and low resistance of proximal vein and its outflow tract, pulsation is often rapidly weakened within the iliac crest, only at the proximal end it is only obvious when the vein is narrow or occluded. the proximal arterial blood flow direction is always toward the fistula, the proximal vein is always centripetal, the arterial collateral branch diverts to the periorbital blood, and the venous collateral blood flows to the heart. due to anatomy and hemodynamic factors, the distal movement the venous blood can flow or flow away from the fistula or even stagnant. the direction of blood flow in the distal artery depends on the relative pressure of the mouth of the fistula and the inflow of the collateral. three conditions may occur: a. the ratio of the mouth resistance to the proximal arterial resistance when the ratio of distal vascular bed resistance to collateral artery resistance is exceeded, the blood flow is in the normal direction, which is more common in small iliac crests, high resistance arteriovenous fistula and collateral arteries are less high, and high resistance, b. distal vascular bed resistance when the ratio of resistance to collateral arteries exceeds the ratio of mouthparts resistance to proximal arterial resistance, blood reflux is common in patients with large iliac crest, chronic, low-resistance arteriovenous fistula and collateral arteries, and c. ratios produce blood flow. stasis, occasionally before the formation of large acute arteriovenous fistula collateral circulation, at this time, systolic blood flow in the normal direction, diastolic reflux, distal arterial blood reflux not only ingesting peripheral vascular bed nutrition, but also increase heartdirty load, such as the fistula is quite small, the distal venous blood flow will be in the normal direction, which only occurs when the venous pressure of the nearest collateral joint exceeds the fistula; if the fistula is larger, the venous pressure at the fistula will exceeding the distal venous pressure, but the valve with complete function between the fistula and the first branch of the vein will block the blood from flowing back. as the pressure increases, the distal vein gradually expands and the valve is closed, so in the large chronic arteriovenous fistula, blood the valve can be countercurrent to the distal vein via a dysfunctional valve. 2 blood pressure: the proximal arterial pressure is normal, large acute arteriovenous fistula, there may be systolic and diastolic blood pressure drop; such as chronic arteriovenous fistula, proximal arterial dilatation, the pressure can exceed the same anatomical level of relatively normal artery pressure. the distal arterial pressure is often reduced, the average blood pressure and pulse pressure will be lower than the proximal artery, the fistula is small, along the proximal artery, the fistula to the distal artery, the pressure is gradually reduced; when the fistula is large, the pressure at the fistula is obvious lower, that is, the pressure decreases from the proximal artery to the fistula, but the pressure from the fistula to the distal artery will rise again. the reverse of the distal arterial pressure gradient will produce blood reflux, chronic arteriovenous fistula, with the diameter of the lateral branch artery the distal arterial pressure tends to increase, causing the distal arterial blood to flow back. although there is blood shunt through the fistula, due to the low resistance of the proximal venous outflow tract, the vein wall is well compliant, can adapt to the arterial blood flow without change, the proximal venous pressure is still maintained at a low level, 1 cm away from the fistula. the average venous pressure is 0 to 2.00 kpa (0 to 15 mmhg), and the pulse pressure is hardly more than 0.667 kpa (5 mmhg). if the proximal vein is compressed or blocked, the venous pressure will increase significantly and approach the pressure at the mouth of the fistula. the distal venous pressure depends on the size of the fistula and the resistance to countercurrent flow. when the fistula is small, the peripheral to mouth pressure is gradually reduced. when the fistula is large, the venous pressure in the fistula area is greatly increased, and the function of the acute arteriovenous iliac vein valve is complete. inhibition of blood reflux, the distal venous pressure may equal or exceed the distal arterial pressure; as the disease progresses into the chronic phase, the distal venous dilatation leads to venous valve dysfunction and the venous collaterals dilate, the distal venous pressure tends to decrease. 3 blood vortex: typical tremor and murmur of arteriovenous fistula, caused by abnormal blood flow phase caused by vibration of the relevant blood vessel wall, often associated with collateral formation, vascular tortuosity, aneurysm-like changes and sudden changes in vessel diameter, h-type arteriovenous fistula is common. 4 morphological changes: the movement of chronic arteriovenous fistula, the increase of venous blood flow, the morphological changes of angiogenesis, usually the mouth enlarges with the prolongation of the disease course, rarely spontaneously close or shrink, the most typical is the progressive arterial growth and expansion, can be distorted and tumor-like changes, early thickening of the arterial wall, but eventually degenerative with smooth muscle atrophy, elastic tissue reduction and atheromatous plaque formation, the most obvious vasodilation near the fistula, such as the disease duration is more than 1 to 2 years, and the lesion is irreversible. proximal arterial growth, distortion is related to hemodynamic factors, the force of pulling the artery along the long axis of the artery is proportional to the longitudinal pressure gradient, the latter is a functional manifestation of blood flow velocity, the proximal vein has the same change, the vein wall not only irregular thickening due to intimal hyperplasia and fibrosis, but also degenerative changes such as atherosclerosis and neoplastic changes, the inner elastic layer tends to break and disappear, and the endothelium damage of the lateral vein wall of the fistula may be caused by blood spurt or vein wall vibration, the canine arteriovenous fistula experiment suggests that the thickening of the venous intima and medial membrane is related to the eddy current of the distal anastomosis and the kinetic energy transmitted into the adjacent tissue, and the collateral branch is established. the more the sacral blood passes through the varicose veins, the farther veins that grow into the distal side, unlike the proximal and proximal, distal veins, which can remain the same size or even smaller. 5 collateral circulation: arteriovenous fistula is an important reason to promote the formation of collaterals, and its abundance is far more than that of atherosclerotic lesions. the two theories about collateral formation are increased blood flow velocity and increased pressure through the collateral vessel. studies have shown that the blood flow around the collaterals of the arteriovenous fistula often exceeds the blood flow around the occluded arteries. this is consistent with the first theory. when the fistula is present, blood can flow from the distal artery to the fistula, causing the collaterals. the outflow tract resistance is significantly reduced; when the artery is occluded, the collateral blood needs to flow to the vascular bed with relatively high peripheral resistance, so when the distal arterial blood flows countercurrently, the collateral blood flow of the arteriovenous fistula will be higher than the arterial occlusion disease. holman et al. have long pointed out the importance of blood flow in the distal arteries. when the proximal arterial iliac crest is established or the distal artery is ligated in the proximal sac, the collateral formation is significantly reduced due to the suppression of blood reflux. when the artery is ligated at a single branch, a wide collateral circulation will form. arteriovenous iliac vein collateral formation may exceed the arterial collateral branch, leading to superficial varices, large acute arteriovenous fistula blood flows into the distal vein through the venous collateral, and the valve closure prevents blood from flowing backwards, with the prolongation of the disease, the distal vein valve insufficiency, by increasing the collateral venous branch to avoid blood reflux, the proximal vein occlusion, the largest formation of venous collaterals can be seen, allowing all the collateral blood to flow back in the distal vein. (3) changes in peripheral circulation: arteriovenous fistula affects the blood supply of surrounding tissues, common peripheral tissues are pale, cyanosis, edema and pulse weakening, proximal to the fistula, arterial blood rapidly enters superficial veins and deep veins, skin, muscle and bone tissue the temperature is elevated; at the distal end of the fistula, the tissue temperature is often lower than normal, the peripheral oxygen and partial pressure of the muscle and bone tissue can be reduced, the venous oxygen saturation is lowered, and the lactic acid concentration is increased. 1 blood flow and blood pressure: when the fistula is small, the blood in the direction of normal blood flow of the distal artery and the blood of the collateral artery supply the peripheral arteries and their corresponding tissues, even if the fistula is large, the blood of the distal artery is countercurrent, far the blood flow of the collateral branch combined with a certain part must enter the peripheral supply vascular bed tissue again, that is, to some extent, the peripheral arterial blood can maintain its normal blood flow direction, such as large radial artery-cephalic arteriovenous fistula, peripheral the direction of blood flow is the same, the dividing point between the countercurrent and the downstream is in the shallow arch of the palm, the fistula is small, and the collateral artery is larger. because of the compensatory dilatation of the small artery, the peripheral blood flow may not decrease; the fistula is larger, the collateral artery when less, the small arteries are not enough to maintain tissue nutrition, especially when the distal arteries have a large amount of blood reflux. some patients do not affect the tissue nutrition, but the distal blood supply of the affected limbs is relatively reduced compared with the unaffected limbs. although the reduction of arteriolar resistance can make the blood flow relatively normal, the peripheral blood pressure can be increased or decreased due to the loss of the fistula energy. the literature reports that the lateral-lateral arteriovenous fistula of the radial artery-cephalic vein is 88% of the ipsilateral limb. the distal arterial pressure drops. the effect of compression of the fistula on the relevant blood vessels: the study of the radial artery-cephalic arteriovenous fistula showed that when the proximal end of the radial artery was compressed, the peripheral blood flow and blood pressure were reduced. when the fistula was small, the compression of the proximal radial artery could eliminate the radial artery. the end of the blood flow, but the blood flow can flow from the distal end of the radial artery to the fistula, that is, the blood flow in the distal part of the radial artery; when the fistula is large, the compression of the proximal radial artery can increase the reverse blood flow at the distal end of the radial artery. compression of the proximal artery can increase the ""stolen blood"" of the lateral branch around the fistula, further reducing the blood supply to the peripheral tissue, and oppressing the important collateral and ulnar artery also leads to a significant decrease in blood pressure and blood flow of the finger artery, although this method is when the mouth is large, the blood flow from the distal end of the radial artery can be reversed to the forward direction, or when the fistula is small, the blood flow can be increased. however, because the excessive blood flows through the low-resistance branch, the peripheral blood perfusion is reduced and the pressure is reduced. the collateral arteries can sometimes produce more severe vascular blood flow reduction than the compression proximal artery. closing any outflow tract of the iliac crest, such as the proximal or distal vein, can increase the effective resistance of the iliac crest and the blood pressure and blood flow of the finger artery. dagukou distal in the pulse, because the distal arterial blood flow is eliminated, all the collateral blood flows to the distal tissue, and the peripheral blood flow increases more obviously. if the fistula is small and the distal arterial blood flow is compliant, the distal artery can be compressed. peripheral perfusion is reduced, depending on the blood volume of the collateral artery. when the iliac crest and the proximal and distal arteries and veins are completely closed, the peripheral perfusion may increase or decrease according to the size of the fistula and the functional capacity of the collateral vessels. for example, the fistula and the lateral branches are larger, and the fistula and the four related vessels will be closed. increase peripheral pressure and blood flow; if the fistula is small, the collateral circulation is less, it can lead to lower peripheral perfusion, the distal arterial blood is completely from the proximal artery, and the compression of the proximal artery will decrease the peripheral perfusionz(4) systemic influence: the most basic pathophysiological change is the decrease of total peripheral resistance. it means that the left ventricular resistance is equal to the sum of the mouthparts resistance and the peripheral vascular bed resistance. the systemic blood flow is the blood flow output from the heart, perfusion of peripheral tissues; the branch blood flow is the blood flow through the collateral branch. the sum of the systemic blood flow and the sacral blood flow is equal to the cardiac output. when the total peripheral resistance of the arteriovenous fistula decreases, the body increases the heart discharge by increasing the heart rate and the stroke volume. the amount of increased cardiac output will maintain arterial pressure, reduce venous pressure and provide sufficient blood nutrition to the peripheral tissues. the increase in stroke volume is more conducive to venous return and increased blood volume. these compensatory mechanisms are in arteriovenous fistula. it plays an important role. when large arteriovenous decompensation, arterial pressure and systemic blood flow can be reduced, while systemic resistance and left and right atrial pressure are increased. 1 arterial pressure and left ventricular pressure: when the acute arteriovenous fistula is suddenly open, the peripheral resistance decreases significantly, and the arterial pressure drops linearly. after the increase of cardiac output and systemic resistance, the arterial pressure rapidly returns to the baseline level, according to the size of the fistula. the mean arterial pressure often decreases to a certain extent. because the diastolic blood pressure drops more than the systolic blood pressure, the pulse pressure can be increased, but it can be inconsistent. closing the acute arteriovenous fistula can cause a sudden increase in arterial pressure, while the spontaneous blood output and systemic resistance decreased, arterial pressure quickly returned to the level before closure, most patients with chronic arteriovenous fistula, the average arterial pressure maintained in the normal range, but diastolic blood pressure can be reduced, pulse pressure widened (water pulse), compression or surgery to close the chronic arteriovenous the mouthwash response is similar to acute arteriovenous fistula. left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure decreased in the opening of acute arteriovenous fistula, but end-diastolic pressure can quickly return to the level of near-opening. closing the fistula can produce temporary systolic and end-diastolic pressure, large chronic arteriovenous fistula, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure gradually increased, even severe heart failure can even kill. 2 venous pressure: when the arteriovenous fistula is open, the central venous pressure only rises a few millimeters of water column, which is difficult to detect. the pressure of the venous pool is reduced due to the increase of cardiac output, and the compliance of the vein itself can accommodate the increased venous volume. the venous pressure is often maintained at a normal level. 3 atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery pressure: the opening of the arteriovenous fistula increases the left and right atrium and the mean pulmonary artery pressure. the absolute range of the increase is small, which is related to the blood flow through the sacral branch. when the arteriovenous fistula is opened for the first time, right ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures increase, but diastolic blood pressure can quickly return to pre-opening levels, and closing the fistula can reverse this process. 4 cardiac output, systemic blood flow and sacral blood flow: after the opening of acute arteriovenous fistula, cardiac output immediately increased, reaching a peak level within a few seconds, due to the rapid rise of blood flow from zero to close at the highest level, early blood flow through the vascular bed of the whole body is consistent with the decline of the mean arterial pressure in the early stage. closing the fistula can reverse the course of the disease, the blood flow of the sacral branch drops to zero, and the blood flow of the system temporarily rises more than the level of the anterior the blood output decreased rapidly, and the increase of systemic blood flow was consistent with the temporary increase of systemic blood pressure, reflecting the body's regulation of excessive cardiac output through high-resistance peripheral vascular bed rather than low-resistance gargle, mouthwash, cardiac output the increase is equal to the blood flow of the sacral branch, the blood flow of the whole body is not reduced; the sputum is larger, and the blood flow of the sacral branch is more than 27% to 40% of the blood output of the anterior tibia. the increase of cardiac output may not be equal to the blood flow of the sacral branch. it can steal blood from the peripheral vascular bed, resulting in a decrease in systemic blood flow. peripheral vascular compensatory contraction can prevent the reduction of mean arterial pressure. when the collateral blood flow exceeds 60% of the anterior cardiac output, the compensation is insufficient. decreased blood flow to the whole body, according to the mouth small, resting state of cardiac output increased in varying degrees, medium-sized sputum has no negative effect on increased cardiac output after exertion, 50% to 80% of patients with chronic arteriovenous fistula, closed mouth caused by cardiac output the amount is reduced. 5 heart rate and stroke output: when the cardiac output increases, there is an increase in heart rate and an increase in stroke output. the latter effect is more obvious. the opening of the acute arteriovenous fistula often causes the heart rate to temporarily increase, closing the fistula. before the heart rate returns to normal levels, the short-term decline is lower than the pre-natal level. in patients with chronic arteriovenous fistula, the heart rate is often in the normal range. nicoladoni (1875) and branham (1890) reported that after pressing the fistula or the proximal artery of the fistula heart rate slowed down. most patients' heart rate slowed more than 4 times/min, which occurred after a transient increase in systemic arterial pressure, but high-dose atropine was blocked, suggesting that this heart rate changes from carotid sinus and aortic arch baroreceptor induction, caused by vagus nerve mediated. when the venous return of arteriovenous fistula is increased, the heart rate can be increased and the cardiac output can be increased. the increased stroke volume is related to the increased cardiac output. it is easy to occur when the acetylcholine level is elevated and the sympathetic activity is enhanced. increased myocardial contractility, under normal circumstances, subendocardial oxygen uptake, coronary blood flow and oxygen consumption are greater than subepicardar, and these differences can not be seen in moderate volume arteriovenous fistula, suggesting that when capacity increases, special at the tip of the left ventricle, the endocardial oxygen demand is relatively reduced. 6 heart: heart enlargement is common in patients with chronic arteriovenous fistula, which can be characterized by dilatation or hypertrophy. after a few months of persistent mouthwash, the heart gradually expands, and the mouth of the mouth can be enlarged by up to 80%. when compensating, compensating blood into the large venous system, the heart can be reduced at the beginning, the chronic arteriovenous fistula is closed, and the aorta and left ventricle can be temporarily caused by incomplete emptying of the left heart and decreased blood flow to the vein. increased sex, the right atrium and lung cone capacity decreased, closing the long-standing mouth can gradually reduce the heart, often return to normal within a few weeks. 7 blood volume: patients with chronic arteriovenous fistula often increase blood volume, more than 200 ~ 1000ml / m2 body surface area, excess blood exists in the dilated collateral circulation, including proximal arteriovenous, cardiac, central and collateral vessels, by increasing cardiac output to fill the sacral and systemic circulation to avoid blood sputum, the main factor limiting acute cardiac venous output in acute arteriovenous fistula is insufficient blood volume, rather than insufficient heart reserve. the increase in plasma volume is mainly related to the increase of blood volume. it is activated by sodium and water storage mechanism. the decrease of arterial pressure reduces renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, and the renal tubular reabsorption increases, resulting in decreased urine output. extracellular fluid. accumulation and increased blood volume, renal blood flow decline can also activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, further increase renal sodium and liquid reabsorption, in addition to sodium retention, can also use protein storage to maintain plasma tension, once reached normal blood volume, excess sodium and water in the body is excreted. 8 heart failure: when blood is shunted from the artery to the vein, it can quickly cause heart failure, especially in the aorta-inferior vena cava arteriovenous fistula. if the fistula is small, heart failure may not occur or delay for several years. the direct relationship between increased blood volume and heart failure has been confirmed in animal experiments, but in the human body, heart failure occurs not only in terms of mouth size and cardiac output, but also depending on whether coronary or myocardial disease is present; patients can not endure heart failure in the short term because their heart can tolerate increased circulating load for a long time. edema of acute arteriovenous fistula may be associated with increased local venous pressure. in heart failure, all clinical manifestations of fluid retention such as peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, ascites and weight gain may play an important role in the increase of aldosterone secretion. mouthwash can cause a lot of diuretic. 9 mouthparts: arteriovenous fistula near the heart has greater influence on the whole body than peripheral arteriovenous fistula. when the fistula is located in the main central blood vessels (aorta and inferior vena cava), the proximal end is short due to its large diameter and short length. the resistance of the venous and venous is quite low; the sputum is located in the limb blood vessels, the diameter of the sac is small, and the centrifugal distance is large, so the circumflex resistance is higher. some scholars believe that the pelvic and calf arteriovenous fistula is more than the head, neck and the systemic influence of arteriovenous fistula of the upper extremity is large. this may be due to the hydrostatic pressure, which causes the affected blood vessels to dilate and the resistance to decrease. the arteriovenous fistula involving the branch of the portal vein system has less systemic influence than the other parts of the body. this may be related to the sinusoids are associated with high outflow resistance, but some mesenteric movements, intravenous arteriovenous fistulas, have a significantly increased cardiac output. 10 summary: the opening of the arteriovenous fistula causes the total peripheral resistance to drop suddenly, resulting in a decrease in central arterial pressure, an increase in central venous pressure, a decrease in systemic blood flow, and blood from the artery into the vein, but can be corrected by a compensatory mechanism. increased central venous pressure enlarges the heart chamber and increases myocardial fiber end-diastolic stress. according to the frank-starling mechanism, the stroke volume is increased, the arterial pressure is decreased, and the baroreceptor produces a reflexive heart rate, which is enhanced by circulating acetylcholine and sympathetic catecholamine. myocardial contraction, sympathetic adrenaline stimulates contraction of the small arteries to maintain central arterial pressure, but further reduces peripheral blood flow;

acute myocardial infarction,"acute myocardial infarction ( ami) refers toacute myocardial infarctioncaused by persistent and severe myocardial ischemia.clinically, there are many severe and persistent post-sternal pain, rest and nitrate drugs can not completely relieve, acute circulatory dysfunction, arrhythmia, heart failure, fever, white blood cell count and elevated serum myocardial injury marker enzyme, acute myocardial injury progressive ecg changes in injury and necrosis can be complicated by arrhythmia, shock or heart failure, often life-threatening.the disease is most common in europe and the united states, and about 1.5 million people experience myocardial infarction each year in the united states.in recent years, china has shown a clear upward trend. at least 500,000 new ones are issued each year, and at least 2 million people are now suffering.according to the infarct size, myocardial infarction can be divided into two types: transmural myocardial infarction and subendocardial myocardial infarction.according to the development of the disease, myocardial infarction can be divided into acute myocardial infarction and old myocardial infarction.","because epidemiological data show that coronary heart disease is one of the most important diseases causing human death, and there is still no radical treatment in clinical practice, it is of great significance for the active prevention of coronary heart disease. the prevention of coronary heart disease involves in the primary prevention and secondary prevention, primary prevention refers to taking measures to control or reduce the risk factors of coronary heart disease in people who have not suffered from coronary heart disease to prevent disease and reduce the incidence rate. secondary prevention means patients with coronary heart disease take medicinal or non-pharmacological measures to prevent recurrence or prevent exacerbations. 1. primary prevention measures the primary prevention measures for coronary heart disease include two situations: (1) health education: educate the whole population on health knowledge, improve citizens' self-care awareness, avoid or change bad habits, such as quitting smoking, pay attention to reasonable diet, proper exercise, maintain psychological balance, etc., thereby reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease. (2) control high-risk factors: for high-risk groups of coronary heart disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, and family history, etc., give positive treatment, of course, some of these risk factors can be controlled such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking, less active lifestyle, etc.; and some can not be changed, such as family history of coronary heart disease, age, gender, etc., treatment methods include continuous control of appropriate drugs blood pressure, correct abnormal blood lipid metabolism, limit smoking, limit physical activity, control physical activity, control weight, control diabetes, etc. 2, secondary prevention measures the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease patients also includes two aspects, the first aspect contains the content of primary prevention, that is, to control the risk factors of various coronary heart disease; the second aspect, the use of already proven effective drugs to prevent recurrence and exacerbation of coronary heart disease. currently, there are certain preventive drugs: (1) antiplatelet drugs: a number of clinical trials have confirmed that aspirin can reduce the occurrence of myocardial infarction and infarction rate, aspirin after acute myocardial infarction can reduce the rate of reinfarction by about 25%; if aspirin can not tolerate or allergies, clopidogrel can be used. (2) 汕-blockers: as long as there are no contraindications (such as severe heart failure, severe bradycardia or respiratory diseases, etc.), patients with coronary heart disease should use beta blockers, especially in the occurrence of acute coronary after the arterial event; there are data showing that the use of beta blockers in patients with acute myocardial infarction can reduce the mortality and reinfarction rate by 20% to 25%. the drugs available are metoprolol, propranolol, thiolol and so on. (3) acei: used in patients with severe impairment of left ventricular function or heart failure, many clinical trials (such as save, aire, smile and trace, etc.) have confirmed that acei reduces mortality after acute myocardial infarction; therefore, after acute myocardial infarction, patients with ejection fraction <40% or wall motion index P 1.2, and no contraindications should use acei, commonly used captopril, enalapril, benazepril and blessing simplice and so on. (4) statin lipid-lowering drugs: the results of studies from 4s, care and recent hps show that long-term lipid-lowering therapy for patients with coronary heart disease not only reduces the overall mortality rate, but also improves the survival rate; and requires coronary intervention the number of patients with cabg is reduced, which is due to the improvement of endothelial function, anti-inflammatory effects, effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation and interference with platelet aggregation, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and other functions, simvastatin, and deforestation. statins, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin all have this effect. in addition, coronary angiography has coronary atherosclerotic mild stenotic lesions and clinically no ischemic symptoms, although it is not clearly diagnosed as coronary heart disease, it should be regarded as a high-risk group of coronary heart disease, giving active prevention, long-dose aspirin can also be given for a long time, and risk factors such as dyslipidemia and hypertension can be eliminated.","1. there is no history of angina before myocardial infarction: coronary atherosclerosis makes the stenosis of the stenosis generally less than 70%, the original lumen is relatively smooth, there is no effective collateral circulation in the area of blood supply to the artery, and the thrombus makes the lumen suddenly complete. blockage, acute necrosis of the myocardium by this blood vessel, such patients have a rapid onset, severe symptoms, myocardial necrosis often from the subendocardial to subepicardial through the ventricular wall, the infarct site often thin and outward expansion in the first week of onset, the heart is easily ruptured, and the thrombus is blocked at the proximal end of the large branch of the coronary artery. the penetrating infarction has a wide range, and acute left heart failure, cardiogenic shock and ventricular aneurysm often occur. 2, the history of angina or old myocardial infarction: acute thrombosis occlusion of another coronary artery, not only cause acute myocardial necrosis at the blood supply site, and block the collateral circulation to provide the original ischemic and old myocardial infarction to make the condition more serious than before. 3, multiple coronary atherosclerosis: in a coronary plaque has caused the acute thrombosis of the stenosis of the stenosis, generally have a history of angina, due to the presence of a certain number of collateral circulation to the epicardium the lower myocardium plays a protective role. the myocardial necrosis caused by acute blockage may be limited to the subendocardial myocardium, which is characterized by multiple focal necrosis and a small infarct size, so it is not easy to cause cardiac rupture and ventricular aneurysm formation. 4, in the coronary plaque thrombosis incomplete occlusion: patients often have unstable angina, can also lead to subendocardial acute myocardial infarction, ecg no abnormal q wave, this time should be serum myocardial enzymology, to help diagnosis. some authors performed coronary angiography within 12 hours after onset of a group of patients with acute myocardial infarction, showing 40% of patients with coronary artery vasospasm. injecting nitroglycerin into the occluded coronary artery can open or partially open the occluded lumen, indicating that the group acute myocardial infarction is caused by coronary spasm. the surface of the lipid-rich soft plaque has a thin fiber-covered cap, and the shape of the plaque, in which the fat stove is in an eccentric position, is easily broken by the impact of blood flow, except for the structure of these vulnerable plaques, the coronary artery acute changes in intracavitary pressure; changes in coronary artery tension; with external factors such as coronary bending and torsion of each heart beat, vulnerable plaque rupture or subendocardial hemorrhage, platelet aggregation thrombosis, coronary artery occlusion causes myocardial infarction. shock, dehydration, hemorrhage, surgery or severe arrhythmia, causing a sudden drop in cardiac output and a sharp decrease in coronary perfusion. heavy physical activity, elevated blood pressure or emotional agitation, resulting in a significant increase in left ventricular load, increased secretion of catecholamines, myocardial oxygen demand, coronary artery blood supply is significantly insufficient, leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. incidence factors for theonsetof myocardial infarction, like all coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia (or low-density lipoprotein), hypertension and smoking are important risk factors. 1. gender and age: male patients are more than females. the ratio of male to female is 2:1 to 3:1. the vast majority of acute myocardial infarction occurs in middle-aged and elderly people over 40 years old. 95%, individual patients are less than 30 years old, and the incidence rate increases significantly with age. 2, the original disease before the onset: china reported that myocardial infarction combined with hypertension accounted for 50% to 90%, in beijing from 1972 to 1983, 53.1% to 70.2%, generally higher than the foreign recorded merger rate the number of cases with diabetes is 3.9% to 7.5%, which is slightly lower than that reported by most foreign countries. nearly half of the patients have a history of angina. 3, predisposing factors: according to domestic data, about 1/2 to 2/3 cases have incentives to find, which are overworked, emotional or mental stress is the most common, followed by full meals and upper respiratory tract or other infections, a few for the operation of hemorrhage or other causes of hypotension, shock and subarachnoid hemorrhage, etc., some patients have seizures during sleep or complete rest. the number of acute myocardial infarction cases in a group of hospitals in beijing has obvious seasonal changes. regularity, there are two peaks in the incidence from november to january and march to april, suggesting that the incidence is related to climate change. the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, intravascular thrombosis, sub-arterial hemorrhage or persistent arterial spasm on the basis of coronary atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in a permanent and complete occlusion of the lumen, leading to acute myocardial infarction. 1. intracoronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction: the vast majority of acute myocardial infarction is caused by acute occlusion of the lumen on the basis of coronary atherosclerotic lesions, and the cause of this occlusion is mainly arteries. thrombosis, recent studies have also confirmed that coronary artery acute thrombosis is the main cause of acute transmural myocardial infarction, when coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture, its contents exposed, induce platelet aggregation, thrombosis and vasospasm myocardial ischemia occurs when coronary blood flow is drastically reduced, and myocardial necrosis is caused by severe and long-lasting ischemia. in acute myocardial infarction, coronary thrombosis can be as high as 90%. 2. coronary artery spasm and myocardial infarction: coronary angiography was performed in 290 patients with myocardial infarction in beijing fuwai hospital. it was found that 6.8% of patients showed normal coronary artery. considering myocardial infarction caused by coronary artery spasm, the original coronary artery was not excluded. the thrombus is naturally dissolved, and persistent coronary artery spasm can cause acute myocardial infarction. coronary artery spasm can also be caused by rupture of atheromatous plaque or subendocardial hemorrhage, induce platelet aggregation and release of thromboxane a2 and serotonin. platelet aggregation and vasospasm can lead to thrombosis, resulting in acute myocardial infarction. 3, atherosclerotic plaque bleeding and ulcers and myocardial infarction: according to recent research, there are two ways of thrombosis after plaque rupture: one is the plaque surface erosion, the thrombus occurs at the rupture, which attaches to the surface of the plaque and blocks the blood vessels. lead to myocardial ischemia and necrosis; and another type of thrombosis is the formation of thrombus in the deep rupture of the plaque, which gradually enlarges and blocks the blood vessels, causing acute myocardial infarction. in addition, atherosclerotic plaque can block the distal coronary artery branch and cause myocardial necrosis. . 4, sympathetic excitation and myocardial infarction: stress, overwork, mental stress, etc. can stimulate sympathetic excitation, release catecholamines, induce myocardial infarction, catecholamine induced myocardial infarction possible mechanisms are as follows: (1) myocardial cell calcium influx increased : myocardial contractility is enhanced, myocardial oxygen consumption is increased, and the hypoxic myocardium is further damaged. (2) catecholamine can damage myocardial cell mitochondria: reduce atp production. (3) catecholamine excites alpha receptors: coronary vasoconstriction, beta receptor excitation, and increased heart rate, resulting in increased myocardial oxygen consumption and reduced oxygen supply. (4) increased plasma free fatty acid concentration: promote platelet aggregation, leading to vascular occlusion. pathophysiology the pathophysiological changes of acute myocardial infarction are mainly manifested by some hemodynamic changes in ventricular involvement, electrophysiological instability and late ventricular remodeling. 1. hemodynamic changes: the severity of hemodynamic changes in ventricular involvement depends primarily on the extent and location of the infarct. (1) left ventricular function: the coronary artery is interrupted by the forward blood flow, and the myocardial blood supply below the obstruction site loses the ability to contract, and the contraction cannot be completed. the myocardial sequence has four abnormal forms of contraction: 1 motion synchronization disorder, ie phase adjacent myocardial segment contraction time is inconsistent. 2 contraction is weakened, that is, the range of myocardial contraction is reduced. 3 no contraction, that is, myocardial contraction is suspended. 4 abnormal, systolic bulging, and dysfunction at the infarction site, residual normal myocardial early hyperactivity, this is the result of acute compensation, including increased sympathetic nervous system activity and frank-starling mechanism, due to non-infarct segments myocardial contraction causes abnormal movement in the infarcted area, so partial compensatory excessive exercise is ineffective. excessive exercise in the non-infarcted area gradually disappears within 2 weeks of infarction, and some degree of contraction recovery occurs in the infarcted area, especially in the infarcted area. when there is reperfusion and the myocardial stagnation is relieved, the faster and more obvious these conditions appear. non-infarcted areas of ami patients also often have a decline in systolic function, which may be related to the already existing non-infarcted coronary stenosis in the supply ventricle, and the newly occurring infarct-related arterial occlusion, resulting in loss of collateral blood supply in the non-infarcted area. the latter case is also called ""distal ischemia"". on the contrary, the presence of collateral circulation before mi can better prevent local systolic dysfunction in the occlusive arterial region, and early left ventricular ejection fraction after infarction. improve. if myocardial ischemic injury is severe, left ventricular pump function declines; cardiac output, stroke output, blood pressure and dp/dt peak decrease; end-systolic volume increases, the latter is the most valuable predictor of mortality after ami index, abnormal systolic expansion of a part of ventricular muscle, further reducing left ventricular stroke volume, but when necrotic cardiomyocytes slide each other, the infarct area is pulled and thinned, especially in patients with extensive anterior wall infarction , leading to infarct extension, the first few hours to several days after infarction, local and whole ventricular muscle tension increased according to laplace's law, in some patients, there is a vicious circle of further expansion of the left ventricle, degree of ventricular dilatation and infarct size, infarction the early and late opening of the relevant blood vessels is related to the activation of the local renin-angiotensin system in the non-infarcted area of the ventricle. the use of acei can effectively alleviate ventricular dilatation, even in the absence of symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction. over time, edema, cell infiltration and fibrosis occur in the ischemic necrosis site. this change can increase the hardness of the myocardium. the increase in the hardness of the infarct zone can prevent the contralateral movement of the ventricular wall during systole, thus helping to improve ventricular function. unless extremely severe myocardial infarction occurs, wall motion can be improved during the healing period due to the gradual recovery of the stunned cell function, regardless of how long the infarction occurs, 20% to 25% of patients with left ventricular motion abnormalities it can show the hemodynamic signs of left ventricular failure. infarction and necrotic myocardium can change left ventricular diastolic function, increase left ventricular compliance first and then decrease, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure initially rises after a few weeks, end-diastolic volume increases, diastolic blood pressure begins to decline and tends to normal, just like myocardial necrosis as with systolic dysfunction, the extent of diastolic dysfunction is also related to the infarct size. (2) regulation of circulatory function: when the circulatory function of ami is abnormal, and it occurs in the anatomical or functional stenosis of the coronary vascular bed, stenosis can lead to regional myocardial ischemia. if continuous development, mi can be formed. infarct size reaches a certain level, will inhibit the entire left ventricular function, resulting in decreased left ventricular stroke volume and filling pressure, left ventricular stroke volume decreased significantly will eventually reduce aortic pressure and coronary perfusion pressure, which can aggravate the myocardium ischemia causes a vicious circle, and the left ventricular emptying capacity is impaired to increase the preload, so that the part of the left ventricle with good perfusion function is expanded. this compensatory mechanism can restore the stroke volume to normal level, but make the ejection the score decreased, the left ventricle of the dilatation also increased the post-load, and the increase of the post-load not only inhibited the left ventricular stroke volume, but also aggravated myocardial ischemia. when the dysfunctional myocardial region was small and the rest of the left ventricle functioned normally, the compensatory mechanism it can maintain the function of the whole left ventricle. once the left ventricle is mostly necrotic, although the remaining part of the ventricle is expanded, the whole left ventricular function is inhibited and cannot be maintained. circulation pump failure occurred. 2, electrophysiological changes: infarcted myocardial cell edema, necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, etc. can cause ecg instability, atrial necrosis caused by ischemic necrosis, activation of ventricular intramuscular receptors, will increase sympathetic activity, increase the concentration of catecholamines in circulating blood and the amount of catecholamine released from the nerve endings in the heart, catecholamine release may also be directly caused by ischemic damage of sympathetic neurons, and the ischemic myocardial may cause arrhythmogenic effects on norepinephrine. allergic reactions, and the effects of different concentrations of catecholamines in different parts of the ischemic myocardium are highly variable. sympathetic stimulation of the heart can also increase the self-discipline of purkinje fibers, and catecholamines accelerate calcium-mediated slow ions. flow-reactive conduction, catecholamine stimulation of ischemic myocardium can induce arrhythmia by relying on these currents. in addition, transmural mi blocks the afferent and efferent branches of the distal sympathetic nerves that innervate the infarcted area, and, in addition to autonomic nerves in addition to coordinating changes in various cardiovascular reflexes, imbalances in regulation can contribute to arrhythmia this may explain why 汕 blockers also effective in treating ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias in effect when accompanied by other manifestations of hyperactivity increased adrenergic particularly evident. ventricular enlargement after ami, remodeling is easy to cause ventricular depolarization inconsistency and reentry, leading to fatal arrhythmia, electrolyte imbalance such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, acidosis will increase the concentration of free fatty acids in the blood, resulting oxygen free base can also cause arrhythmia, the severity of these lesions, the size of the infarct size and the state of infarct-related arterial perfusion determine the risk of severe arrhythmia in patients - primary ventricular fibrillation (ie, ventricular fibrillation occurs in non-congestive heart) in the event of failure or cardiogenic shock). 3. ventricular remodeling: after myocardial infarction, the left ventricular size, geometry and thickness of the infarcted and non-infarcted segments have changed. these changes are collectively referred to as ventricular remodeling. the remodeling process includes infarct expansion and ventricular enlargement. can affect ventricular function and prognosis, ventricular load status and infarct-related arterial patency is an important factor affecting left ventricular dilatation, elevated ventricular pressure can lead to increased wall tension and risk of infarct expansion; and infarct-related artery patency can accelerate scarring formation increases the filling of the infarcted tissue and reduces the risk of infarct expansion and ventricular dilatation. (1) infarct expansion: acute expansion of the infarct area, which cannot be explained by additional myocardial necrosis, and thinning makes the increase of the infarct area called infarct expansion. the reason is that the sliding between the muscle bundles reduces the room of the entire thickness. number of parenchymal cells; rupture of normal cardiomyocytes; loss of tissue in the necrotic area, characterized by disproportionate thinning and dilatation of the infarcted area, and then the formation of a strong fibrotic scar, the extent of infarct expansion is related to the thickness of the wall before infarction, previous cardiac hypertrophy prevents myocardial thinning, and the apical wall is the thinnest, which is the most vulnerable to infarct expansion. the occurrence of infarct expansion not only increased the mortality rate, but also the incidence of non-fatal complications such as heart failure and ventricular aneurysm was significantly increased. more than 3/4 of patients who died of ami had myocardial infarction expansion, 1/3 ~2/3 is the anterior st-segment elevation infarction. echocardiography is the best method for diagnosing infarct expansion. the ventricular free extension zone can be found. when the expansion is severe to a certain extent, the most typical clinical manifestation is there is a loud running horse, as well as pulmonary congestion or deterioration of the original pulmonary congestion, which is the most serious consequence of infarct expansion. (2) ventricular dilatation: in addition to infarct expansion, the expansion of the ventricular survival part is also associated with remodeling. ventricular dilation begins immediately after the infarction, and may continue for several months or even years after the expansion of the non-infarcted area. considered as a compensatory mechanism for maintaining stroke volume for a wide range of infarctions, the additional burden on residual functional myocardium may be responsible for cardiac hypertrophy. hypertrophic myocardium may help to compensate for functional damage caused by infarction. some patients are the hemodynamic improvement seen in the months after mi is due to this, the surviving myocardium is finally damaged, leading to further expansion of the myocardium, overall myocardial dysfunction, and finally heart failure, although the spherical expansion of the non-infarcted area can be partially compensatory maintenance of cardiac function, but also makes the myocardial depolarization tend to be inconsistent, making patients prone to fatal arrhythmias. the basis of myocardial remodeling is the phenotypic change, which is mainly caused by the re-expression of embryonic genes caused by pathological stimulation, which leads to rapid myocardial growth to compensate for the increase of myocardial load after myocardial infarction and the increase of myocardial mass. partly due to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, however, the quality of these proteins does not meet the requirements for adult myocardium, ultimately leading to myocardial dysfunction, another consequence of changes in gene expression is collagen deposition, causing diffuse interstitial fibrosis, perivascular fibers and focal repair fibrosis, which leads to decreased myocardial compliance and diastolic dysfunction. perivascular fibrosis affects coronary compliance, reduces coronary reserve, and causes myocardial ischemia. in addition, fibrosis may also contribute to ventricular arrhythmias, which are living tissues and contain living cells. therefore, fibroblasts can continue to secrete collagen, and macrophages can continue to phagocytose these collagens, which consume large amounts of oxygen. , energy and nutrition, which leads to the lack of corresponding substances in the working myocardium, these su resulted in cardiac disorder constantly death and ventricular systolic function. there is a lack of blood vessels in the reconstructed myocardium, further reducing the supply of oxygen and nutrients to viable cardiomyocytes, and promoting progressive cell death and remodeling. cardiomyocyte hypertrophy also leads to a relative decrease in mitochondrial density, resulting in energy production. insufficient and myocardial dysfunction. remodeled myocardium also has ca2 transport disorder, which is caused by the relative reduction of sarcoplasmic reticulum, ca2 channel and ca2 pump. the quality of ca2 transporter has also decreased due to changes in gene expression, which also promotes myocardial dysfunction. a feature of myocardial remodeling is the conversion of actin to slow-moving isomers, which causes myocardial contraction to slow down and cause myocardial dysfunction; another important feature is cardiomyocyte necrosis and apoptosis, which can lead to fibrosis. the remodeling is aggravated because the lost cells are replaced by collagen to avoid gaps in the myocardium. in summary, ventricular remodeling is a complex process that begins after an acute onset and can continue for months or years, such as early recanalization of the occluded coronary artery, reduction of infarct size, nitrate and angiotensin transformation. the use of enzyme inhibitors can reduce the pressure of ventricular expansion in the early stage of infarction, and can play a beneficial role in ventricular dilatation.","['myocardial necrosis extensive', 'chest pain', 'guanjue silver', 'cardiac cell turbidity', 'chest suffocation', 'chest tightness', 'the wound no longer bleeds during surgery', 'atrial to ventricular contraction...

alcoholic cardiomyopathy,"long-term heavy drinking can lead to myocardial lesions, showing a similar appearance of dilated cardiomyopathy, called alcoholic cardiomyopathy (acm), 1995 world health organization and international federation of cardiology association (who/isfc) working group in the report of the expert committee on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy is classified as a cardiomyopathy caused by allergic and poisoning reactions in specific cardiomyopathy, and the condition can be relieved or healed after alcohol withdrawal.the onset of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is closely related to long-term alcohol intake. it occurs mostly in men aged 30-55 years. it usually has a history of excessive alcoholism for more than 10 years. the clinical manifestations are diverse, mainly manifested as cardiac insufficiency and heart rhythm. abnormal.after the alcohol withdrawal, the condition can be relieved or healed by itself.the incidence rate in countries such as europe, america and russia is high. there are reports of sporadic cases in china, and the incidence has increased in recent years.","life restraint pays attention to rest, work and rest, life is orderly, and maintaining an optimistic, positive and upward attitude towards life is of great help in preventing diseases.do the regularity of tea and rice, live daily, not overworked, open-minded, and develop good habits.","impairing the integrity of the myocardial cell membrane, through the biological properties of alcohol-soluble fat, invading the cell membrane to cause liquefaction and changing the cell membrane fat composition and molecular configuration, so that the membrane surface ion distribution and membrane potential are out of control, affecting cell-to-cell information transfer and ion exchange .affects organelle function, including mitochondrial, sarcoplasmic reticulum and other organelle dysfunction, resulting in reduced myocardial energy supply. it affects the permeability of myocardial cell ions, so that potassium, phosphate or magnesium is lost from the myocardium, and calcium ion overload in myocardial cells can lead to decreased myocardial contractility, which is an important cause of cardiac dysfunction in alcoholic cardiomyopathy. long-term drinking can change the structure of regulatory proteins (pro-protein and promyosin) and affect myocardial relaxation and contraction.long-term heavy drinking can still cause a balanced malnutrition in the human body, which may lead to vitamin deficiency, especially the lack of vitamin b. it can also aggravate heart dysfunction. in addition, certain additives in alcohol contain cobalt, lead and other toxic substances, which can be consumed for a long time. causes poisoning or myocardial damage, due to the interaction and influence of the above reasons, can eventually lead to the occurrence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.","['alcoholic myocardium', 'heart failure', 'ataxia', 'difficulty breathing', 'to first high blood pressure', 'atypical chest pain', 'coronary artery sputum', 'arrhythmia', 'angina' ]","['arrhythmia', 'congestive heart failure', 'alcoholic cirrhosis', 'malnutrition']","['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
acute cardiac insufficiency,"heart dysfunction refers to changes in myocardial structure and function caused by various causes such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, hemodynamic overload, inflammation, etc., resulting in ventricular pumping or filling function is low, cardiac output can not meet the body's need, tissue, organ blood perfusion, and a physiological state of the lung circulation and / or systemic congestion.heart failure is the result of repeated episodes of cardiac insufficiency, causing clinical symptoms, mainly manifested by fatigue, difficulty breathing, and fluid retention.acute heart failure refers to acute heart failure (ahf) with clinical symptoms, common in left heart failure.acute heart failure can be aggravated or sudden onset on the basis of the original chronic heart failure, manifested as systolic heart failure or diastolic heart failure. most patients have organic cardiovascular disease before onset.acute cardiac insufficiency often causes acute pulmonary edema, which is life-threatening and must be rescued urgently.causes of acute cardiac insufficiency, central valve disease, coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension, endocrine disorders, bacterial toxins, acute pulmonary infarction, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases can cause heart disease and heart failure performance.pregnancy, fatigue, rapid intravenous rehydration, etc. can aggravate the burden of the diseased heart and induce myocardial failure.","the comprehensive prevention and treatment of heart failure is a combination of the efforts of specialists, primary doctors, patients and their families, which can significantly improve the effectiveness of prevention and treatment and improve the prognosis of patients. 1. general follow-up: once every 1 to 2 months.understand the patient's heart rate and rhythm, lung up sound, edema degree and other basic conditions and medication. 2. focused follow-up: once every 3 to 6 months.increase biochemical examination, bnp/nt-probnp, ecg detection, chest x-ray and echocardiography if necessary. 3, patient education: (1) let patients understand the basic knowledge of heart failure, master the important clinical manifestations reflecting the worsening of heart failure.

acute infective endocarditis,"acute infective endocarditis is mostly a part of severe systemic infection. the pathogenic microorganisms are highly toxic, involving most normal heart valves, mainly caused by staphylococcus aureus. a few have pneumococci, gonococcus, group a streptococci, and influenza bacilli. caused by clinical, subacute infective endocarditis is rare, the main clinical features are obvious symptoms of poisoning, rapid progression of the disease, valve damage within days to weeks, prone to changes in the intensity and nature of the noise, or appear new murmurs, new and enhanced murmurs caused by valvular lesions are mainly incomplete murmurs, especially aortic regurgitation, which can induce acute left heart failure. in addition, infection is more common and migration is prone to occur. abscess, due to the serious symptoms of systemic infection, can mask the clinical manifestations of acute infective endocarditis.if antibiotics are not used in a timely and effective manner, the mortality rate is high.","1. eliminate the cause and treatment of the cause: actively prevent and treat various infectious diseases such as oral infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections and pneumonia, etc., timely treat various infections, and give antibiotics prevention before performing surgery or device examination, endocarditis it often occurs about two weeks after surgery. 2, health education: adhere to the main prevention, to publicize the dangers of the disease and advise people to stay away from drugs, for those who have intravenous drug addicts to encourage their active detoxification, reduce the important way of cardiac infective endocarditis. 3, preventive medication: first of all to prevent bacteremia, many scholars have found that temporary bacteremia often occurs after tooth extraction, especially in the case of periodontal disease or the simultaneous removal of many teeth, many oral bacteria can enter the blood through wounds, but it is most common with streptococcus viridans. digestive tract and genitourinary system trauma and infection often cause enterococci and gram-negative bacilli. staphylococcal bacteremia is seen on the skin and away from the heart. infection, therefore, it is necessary to use antibiotics to prevent this disease and to avoid abuse.","almost all bacteria can cause this disease. acute infective endocarditis is mostly caused by invasive endocardium by highly toxic bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, pneumococcus, meningococcus, pyogenic streptococcus, influenza bacillus, proteus, escherichia coli, etc. these bacteria have strong virulence, acute onset, serious illness, and infections often secondary to other parts, such as meningitis, pneumonia, thrombophlebitis, etc. metastatic suppurative lesions sometimes associated with other organs usually occur in normal hearts. acute infective endocarditis is different in pathogenesis from subacute infective endocarditis, with 50.0% to 60.0% occurring on normal heart valves. pathogenic microorganisms usually come from skin, muscle, bone or lung. active lesions, which are highly toxic, highly corrosive (such as staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, etc.) and adhesion, can directly invade the valve to cause infection.","['chill war', 'debilitating', 'right heart failure', 'chest pain', 'horse blood', 'respiratory shortness', 'heart expansion', 'heart rate slow']",['renal artery embolization'],"['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
acute pericarditis,"acute pericarditis (acutepericarditis) is an acute inflammation of the visceral and parietal layers of the pericardium, which can be caused by factors such as bacteria, viruses, tumors, autoimmunity, physics, and chemistry.clinical features include chest pain, dyspnea, pericardial friction, jugular vein engorgement, odd veins, and a series of abnormal ecg changes.acute pericarditis has many causes, which can be from the pericardium itself, or it can be part of systemic diseases. it is clinically tuberculous, non-specific, and neoplastic. systemic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and uremia such lesions are easy to get involved in the pericardium caused by pericarditis.tuberculous pericarditis can evolve into chronic constrictive pericarditis if left untreated.","active control of tuberculosis and hiv epidemics can significantly reduce the incidence of tuberculosis and hiv-associated pericarditis. early coronary reperfusion therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction can reduce the incidence of infarct size and pericarditis, actively treat various kidney diseases and prevent development. end-stage renal disease is the most cost-effective measure to reduce uremic pericarditis. once acute pericarditis occurs in various diseases, there is no effective measure to prevent it from developing into pericardial effusion or pericardial tamponade.","bacterial: (1) suppurative pericarditis; (2) tuberculous pericarditis. viral: pericarditis caused by coxsackie, echo, influenza, and cytomegalovirus. fungal: such as histoplasma, actinomycetes, nocardia, ear {0-like bacteria, mycobacteria, and the like. others: such as rickettsia, spirochete, mycoplasma, paragonimiasis, amoeba and cysticercosis. autoimmune diseases: such as rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, scleroderma, polyarthritis, post-cardiac incision syndrome, post-myocardial infarction syndrome, dialysis treatment, kidney transplantation and aids. allergic diseases: such as serum diseases, allergic granuloma and allergic pneumonia. diseases in adjacent organs: such as myocardial infarction, dissecting aneurysms, pulmonary embolism, pleura, lung and esophageal diseases. endocrine and metabolic diseases: such as uremia, mucinous edema, diabetes, gout, axon disease, cholesterol pericarditis, etc. others: such as pancreatitis, thalassemia, intestinal fat metabolism disorders, non-gonococcal arthritis, conjunctiva, urethritis syndrome, etc. trauma such as penetrating wounds, foreign bodies, cardiac catheters, artificial pacemakers, and heart massage. such as hydralazine, procainamide, phenytoin, penicillin, isoniazid, phenylbutazone and methylthiouracil. acute non-specific pericarditis is a serous fibrinous pericarditis. the cause is unknown. it may be related to viral infection or allergies and autoimmune reactions. it is more common in men and young adults. primary mesothelioma, sarcoma, etc. metastasis of secondary lung or breast cancer, multiple myeloma, leukemia and lymphoma can lead to acute pericarditis. pathogenesis 1, pathological anatomy: pathological changes of acute pericarditis, early manifested as inflammatory reaction of the visceral and parietal layers of the pericardium, a viscous liquid containing fibrin deposition and polynuclear leukocyte aggregation, called fibrin or dry pericarditis; due to different causes or progression of the disease, the fluid in the exudate increases, the amount of fluid can be as much as 2 ~ 3l, called exudative or wet pericarditis, the exudate of pericarditis can be fibrin, serum bloody or suppurative. the inflammatory reaction often involves the myocardium in the lower part of the pericardium. a few severe cases may involve the deep myocardium, which is called myocardial pericarditis. after the pericarditis is healed, small plaques may remain or different degrees of adhesion may remain. if the inflammation involves the outer surface of the pericardial wall layer, produces adhesion between the heart and adjacent tissue pleura, mediastinum and diaphragm, exudate of acute fibrinous pericarditis, often completely dissolved and absorbed, or longer-term existence; can also be mechanized, replace scars for connective tissue, and even cause pericardium calcification eventually develops into a constrictive pericarditis. 2, pathophysiology: acute fibrinous pericarditis does not affect hemodynamics, and pericardial effusion is the main cause of a series of pathophysiological changes caused by acute pericarditis, if the exudate progresses slowly, due to excessive pericardial extension, pericardial cavity although it can accommodate 1~2l of liquid without increasing the pressure inside the pericardium, this kind of pericardial effusion without cardiac tamponade or pericardial tamponade can have no clinical symptoms. if the exudate is rapidly or massively accumulated, the pressure in the pericardial cavity will rise. when a certain degree is reached, the heart is dilated, the ventricular diastolic filling is reduced, and the stroke volume is reduced. at this time, the body's compensatory mechanism increases the ventricular filling by increasing the venous pressure, increasing the myocardial contractility to increase the ejection fraction, and accelerating the heart rate. increase cardiac output; increase peripheral arteriolar resistance to maintain blood pressure, such as pericardial effusion continues to increase, pericardial pressure further increased to right atrial right ventricular diastolic blood pressure level, when the pressure difference is equal to zero, cardiac tamponade or pericardial tamponade it can happen that once the pericardial pressure and right ventricular pressure rise to the left ventricular diastolic pressure level, the above compensatory mechanism is exhausted and a distinct heart appears.the performance of the tamponade, that is, the elevated venous pressure can not increase the filling of the ventricle, and the ejection fraction is thus reduced; the heart rate of the overspeed shortens the ventricular diastolic phase and reduces the filling, and the cardiac output decreases; the arteriolar contraction reaches the limit, the artery the pressure drops to circulatory failure, which produces cardiogenic shock.","['chest pain with chest tightness, heart palpitations', 'chest pain', 'cardiac inflammation', 'chest pain with difficulty breathing', 'pericardial fiber thickening', 'systolic and diastolic murmur', 'face pale', 'shoulder the ministry is involved in pain, 'chest stuffiness', 'irritability']",['heart-derived cirrhosis'],"['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
acute heart failure,"acute heart failure (ahf), also known as acute cardiac insufficiency, refers to a decrease in myocardial contractility caused by acute or exacerbated left ventricular dysfunction, aggravation of cardiac load, acute sudden cardiac output, and increased pulmonary circulation pressure. increased peripheral circulation resistance, causing pulmonary circulatory congestion and acute pulmonary congestion, pulmonary edema and associated with tissue, organ hypoperfusion and cardiogenic shock clinical syndrome, left heart failure is the most common.the most common is acute pulmonary edema caused by acute left heart failure.acute heart failure can be aggravated or sudden onset on the basis of the original chronic heart failure. most patients with pre-onset disease have organic cardiovascular disease, which can be characterized as systolic heart failure or diastolic heart failure.central valvular disease, coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension, endocrine disorders, bacterial toxins, acute pulmonary infarction, emphysema or other chronic lung disorders can cause heart failure and heart failure.pregnancy, fatigue, rapid intravenous rehydration, etc. can aggravate the burden of the diseased heart and induce myocardial failure.acute heart failure is often life-threatening and must be rescued urgently.","comprehensive prevention and treatment of heart failure includes the combination of the efforts of specialists, primary care physicians, patients and their families, which can significantly improve the effectiveness of prevention and treatment and improve the prognosis of patients. 1. general follow-up every 1 to 2 months. understand the basic conditions of patients, lung up, edema, heart rate and rhythm and other drug applications. 2. focused follow-up every 3 to 6 months. increase ecg, biochemical examination, bnp/nt-probnp test, chest x-ray and echocardiography if necessary. 3. patient education (1) let patients understand the basic knowledge of heart failure and identify some clinical manifestations that reflect the worsening of heart failure. (2) mastering the method of adjusting essential drugs: 1 edema recurrence or aggravation, decreased urine output or weight gain 2~3kg, diuretic should increase dose; 2 morning resting heart rate should be 55~60 beats/min, such as ≡65 the sub-division may increase the dosage of the beta blocker; 3 the blood pressure lowering, temporarily not increasing the dose of acei/arb, beta blocker and diuretic. (3) avoid stress states such as overwork, emotional and mental stress, various infections, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones, antiarrhythmic drugs, etc. 4. the following conditions occurred, immediately worsened heart failure, unstable blood pressure, heart rate and heart rhythm.","left atrial fluid tumor can cause acute mitral stenosis, severely obstruct blood flow through the mitral valve mouth, resulting in a sharp increase in left atrial pressure.common rheumatic mitral stenosis patients with some incentives, add emotional, fatigue, infection (especially lung infection), pregnancy, childbirth, excessive fluid infusion, arrhythmia, heart rate too fast or too slow etc., the right heart discharge suddenly increased, and due to mitral stenosis, the left ventricular blood volume is limited, resulting in a sharp increase in left atrial pressure, promoting the formation of pulmonary edema.restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, large dendritic pericardial effusion or pericardial fluid is not much, but accumulation is rapid when the heart is stuffed. it can reduce ventricular compliance, diastolic dysfunction, and seriously impede diastolic blood filling. cardiac blood loss is reduced and myocardial oxygen consumption is increased.in addition, left ventricular endocardial myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular endothelium and end-to-end pressure, mitral regurgitation, these diseases often cause severe pulmonary hypertension, acute left heart failure. such as acute myocardial infarction, infective endocarditis or trauma caused by papillary muscle dysfunction, rupture of the cavity, perforation of the perforation, septal perforation and aortic aneurysm rupture.acute heart failure can also be caused by intravenous transfusion or infusion of sodium-containing fluids too quickly or too much. such as acute extensive myocardial infarction, acute severe myocarditis.","['resident doctor', 'heart is accompanied by fatigue, pale face', 'four limbs twitching', 'heart rate increase', 'jugular vein anger', 'apnea-like phenomenon', 'twitching', 'cardiac output increase ', 'cardiac syncope', 'sit on the breath', 'pink foam sputum']","['respiratory infections', 'thrombosis', 'pulmonary embolism', 'cirrhosis', 'electrolyte disorder']","['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hyperthyroidism,"hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism) is a group of common endocrine diseases caused by a variety of causes of hyperthyroidism and/or increased thyroid hormone levels in the blood circulation. it is characterized by swelling, exophthalmia, neurological and cardiovascular system dysfunction. pathologically, the thyroid gland can be diffuse, nodular or mixed.graves disease or toxic diffuse goiter is the most important form of hyperthyroidism.","hyperthyroidism is a chronic and refractory disease. good prevention of hyperthyroidism can effectively reduce the occurrence of hyperthyroidism. therefore, everyone should understand the following items to prevent hyperthyroidism: 1. pay attention to diet: people need to control daily diet in their daily lives. iodine intake can reduce the occurrence of hyperthyroidism. coastal areas should pay attention to dietary iodine-containing foods. it is recommended not to use high-iodine diet to prevent iodine; and inland areas (iodine-deficient areas) should have restrictions on iodine supplementation.avoid excessive or lack of iodine. 2, cause prevention: such as controlling the daily intake of foods containing high iodine and drugs. 3, to avoid mental stimulation: people should develop a good regular life, study, work habits, cultivate sentiment, balance psychology. 4, health examination, should be measured thyroid b ultrasound or test thyroid function to detect hyperthyroidism early, passive detection of hyperthyroidism patients, the condition may be delayed for 2 to 3 years. health education 1, rest and activities: patients with hyperthyroidism due to basal hypermetabolism, exercise endurance decreased, should avoid strenuous exercise, activities do not feel fatigue, increase the rest time, maintain adequate sleep, prevent the disease from getting worse. 2, psychological care: to guide patients and their families on the level of awareness of the disease, so that patients and relatives understand their emotions, personality changes are caused by the disease, temporary, will change after treatment, help patients and their families to deal with emergencies.","in recent years, studies have found that the incidence of graves disease is mainly related to autoimmunity. the hyperthyroidism caused by other lesions has its own characteristics or remains unclear. it is described as follows: immune factors (30%): discovered by adams in 1956 long-acting thyroid stimulating hormone (lats) acts similarly to tsh. it is an immunoglobulin (igg) produced by b lymphocytes. it is an autoantibody against the thyroid gland that binds to thyroid subcellular components and excites the thyroid gland. the follicular epithelium secretes thyroid hormone and causes hyperthyroidism. 60% to 90% of patients with hyperthyroidism have increased lats. later, lats-p substance was also found to be an igg. it is only excited by human thyroid tissue, also known as human thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (htsi). more than 90% of patients with hyperthyroidism are positive. . 1. direct evidence for the immune mechanism of hyperthyroidism is: (1) in the aspect of humoral immunity, various antibodies against thyroid cell components, such as thyroid stimulating antibody (tisi) against tsh receptor, or tsh receptor antibody, are known. (trab), which binds to the tsh receptor or its related tissues, further activates camp and potentiates thyroid function. this antibody can pass through the placenta tissue, causing neonatal hyperthyroidism, or incomplete treatment after hyperthyroidism, the antibody continues to be positive, leading to recurrence of hyperthyroidism. (2) in terms of cellular immunity, it was confirmed that these anti-systems were produced by b lymphocytes. hyperthyroidism patients have sensitized t lymphocytes against thyroid antigen. when hyperthyroidism occurs, lymphocytes can produce lats under the activation of phytohemagglutinin (pha). pha stimulates t lymphocytes and then stimulates b lymphocytes. an immunoglobulin capable of exciting the thyroid gland, such as tsi, causes hyperthyroidism. organ-specific autoimmune diseases are caused by immunomodulatory disorders caused by defects in inhibitory t lymphocyte (ts) function. therefore, the immune response is a complex result involving the interaction of t with b lymphocytes and phagocytic cells. it is thought to be mainly related to the reduction of inhibitory t lymphocyte function related to gene defects. ts function deficiency can lead to t cell sensitization, which causes b cells to produce trab and cause hyperthyroidism. 2, indirect evidence: (1) a large number of lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrated after the thyroid gland and the eyeball. (2) the number of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood circulation increases, which may be accompanied by lymph nodes, and the reticuloendothelial tissue of the liver and spleen. (3) other autoimmune diseases may occur simultaneously or sequentially with the patient and his relatives. (4) blood anti-thyroid antibodies, trab and anti-parietal cell antibodies and anti-myocardial antibodies in patients and their relatives are positive. (5) there are igg, iga and igm in the thyroid and blood. the cause of the induction of graves' disease is currently thought to be due to hereditary defects in the immune monitoring and regulatory functions of patients with ts cells. when there are factors such as foreign trauma, or when there are infectious factors, the immune system is destroyed. out of control, t lymphocyte proliferation and functional variability of tsi are produced, and a large amount of tsi autoantibodies are secreted by ts cells to cause disease. those with trauma and family history have more onset and are predisposing factors. in recent years, it has been found that the white hyperthyroidism hla-b8 is twice as high as that of normal people, the asian japanese hla-bw35 is increased, the foreign chinese hia-bw46 positive susceptibility is increased, and the b13 and b40 are more obvious, which have attracted attention. genetic factors (20%): it is not uncommon to find familial graves disease in the clinic. the same twins have graves disease up to 30% to 60%, and ectopic eggs are only 3% to 9%. family history investigation except for hyperthyroidism in addition, other types of thyroid diseases such as hypothyroidism, or tsi positive in family members may be affected. this suggests that graves' disease has a family genetic predisposition, which may be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or polygenic. other causes of illness (10%): (1) hyperactive nodular goiter or adenoma. in the past, it was considered that this disease was not an autoimmune disease, and no immunological evidence such as igg, tsi or iats was detected in the blood. in 1988, serum thyroglobulin antibodies and microsomal antibodies were detected in single nodules in china, with a positive rate of 16.9% (62/383) and a multi-nodular positive rate of 54.7% (104/190). the thyroid tissue is not regulated by tsi and becomes a hyperactive or hyperactive thyroid nodule or adenoma. it is currently believed that the onset of thyroid adenomas and cancers is also believed to be due to tumor genes. (2) the secretion of tsh from pituitary tumors increases, causing pituitary hyperthyroidism, such as hyperthyroidism associated with tsh secretory tumor or acromegaly. (3) subacute thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, painless thyroiditis, etc. can be associated with hyperthyroidism. (4) hyperthyroidism caused by hyperthyroidism, called hyperthyroidism. if the thyroid gland patients take too much iodine, taking thyroid tablets or excessive levothyroxine sodium (l-t4) can cause hyperthyroidism, and a small number of patients taking amiodarone drugs can also cause hyperthyroidism. (5) ectopic endocrine tumors can cause hyperthyroidism, such as ovarian tumors, choriocarcinoma, digestive system tumors, respiratory tumors and breast cancer and other secretory thyroid stimulating hormone can cause clinical hyperthyroidism. (6) albright syndrome is clinically characterized by multiple fibrous dysplasia, skin pigmentation, elevated blood akp, and may be associated with hyperthyroidism. (7) familial hyperglobulinemia (tbg) can cause hyperthyroidism, which may be due to familial genetic defects or medication. pathogenesis graves disease of the thyroid gland is diffuse enlargement, symmetry, asymmetry, complete envelope, smooth surface, abundant blood flow, follicular and follicular epithelial cell proliferation, from cuboid to column , infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and plasma cells, hyperplasia of liver, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes, lymphocytes in peripheral blood; reflecting the pathological basis of autoimmunity, micro-villi in thyroid follicular epithelial cells increased under electron microscope, small colloid the number of drops increased, the golgi apparatus was hypertrophied, the rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria increased, the lysosomes increased, and the thyroid gland was functionally active. at the time of hyperthyroidism, the body is affected by multiple systemic organs, systemic rhabdomyosargic degeneration, edema, transverse stripes disappear, vacuolar degeneration, degeneration of the nucleus, myocardial degeneration, necrosis of myocytes, mononuclear cell infiltration, mucopolysaccharide deposition, eyeball prominent, extraocular muscle edema hypertrophy, myocyte fat change, lymphocyte infiltration, mucopolysaccharide deposition, optic nerve edema or atrophy; skin can occur symmetric thickening, subcutaneous edema, collagen fiber swelling, lysis and separation, extracellular fluid mucopolysaccharide staining is enhanced, and there are mononuclear cells, which occur in the anterior and lower limbs of the tibia. the liver is swollen, the liver cells are degenerative, the glycogen is reduced, the endocrine glands are affected, and the gonads and adrenal glands can occur in critically ill patients. decreased function, osteoporosis and bone decalcification are common, osteoclast activity is enhanced, bone resorption is more than bone formation, and bone deformity and pathological fracture can occur in severe cases. young adults are rare, and older women are more common.","['gyt enlargement', 'thyroid peroxide...', 'exophthalmia', 'iodine thyroid', 'weight loss', 'new metabolism', 'goiter', 'high thyroid hormone', 'especially easy to hungry', 'to liqin']",['hyperthyroid heart disease'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
dilated cardiomyopathy,"dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) is a common type of primary cardiomyopathy characterized by a significant enlargement of the left ventricle (majority) or the right ventricle, with varying degrees of cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular systolic dysfunction. cardiac enlargement, heart failure, arrhythmia, and embolism are basic features.it used to be called congestive cardiomyopathy.the disease is often accompanied by arrhythmia, the condition is progressively aggravated, death can occur at any stage of the disease, and about 20% of dcm patients have a family history of cardiomyopathy.most of them are middle-aged.the onset is slow, sometimes up to 10 years.symptoms are mainly congestive heart failure, with shortness of breath and edema being the most common.initially short of breath after labor or exhaustion, there may be shortness of breath during mild activities or rest, or occasional paroxysmal breathing difficulties.patients often feel weak.","1. correct the cause and cause: if the lack of nutrition should be corrected, it is necessary to stop drinking after long-term drinking. if the drink relapses after treatment recovery, it is more difficult to treat. perinatal cardiomyopathy should be contraceptive or sterilized to avoid recurrence. seen in the epidemic area of keshan disease can be treated with selenium salt, upper respiratory tract infection is a common cause of cardiac dysfunction induced by dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in the easy infection season (winter and spring), timely application of antibiotics, use transfer factor as appropriate, globulin to improve the body's immunity and prevent respiratory infections. 2. pay attention to rest: rest can reduce the burden on the heart, promote myocardial recovery, limit or avoid physical and mental work according to the patient's heart function, it is appropriate to not have symptoms, but does not advocate complete rest, heart failure and obvious heart the enlarger must stay in bed, take a long rest, improve myocardial metabolism, avoid hypoxia, avoid fatigue, infection, toxins, alcohol, high blood pressure and other possible predisposing factors. keshan disease may lack trace elements in drinking water and food. selenium or other substances are related, so selenium should be added. 3. publicity and education: fully understand the symptoms of patients, analyze their pathophysiological changes and heart function status. in the case of congestive heart failure, in addition to reasonable restrictions on activities, the sodium salt intake should be strictly limited. generally, the salt is controlled below 5g/d. if the condition is severe, it is controlled below 1g/d. it is necessary to give the patient a knowledge of the drug and understand the overall condition of the patient, and regularly adjust the treatment plan. it is reported that there is a disease in the education and care group. the rate was significantly lower than the non-educational care group. 4. factors that may cause cardiomyopathy should be avoided: active prevention and treatment of digestive and respiratory viral infections to prevent myocarditis, prevention and treatment of protozoa such as type 3 protozoa, and prevention of various infections, thereby avoiding myocardial damage caused by infection. antigen-antibody reaction, avoiding coronary artery spasm, myocardial ischemia caused by obstruction, so that the myocardium does not show scattered and focal necrosis and fibrosis.","the persistence of viral rna in the body after viral infection is a risk factor for viral myocarditis to progress to dilated cardiomyopathy. mouse animal experiments have shown that coxsackie virus can dissolve cardiomyocytes, and enterovirus protease can cause myocardial cytoskeleton destruction. this change is recognized as a major feature of dilated cardiomyopathy. viral damage to cardiomyocytes can occur during periods of high viral titer (coxsack b1, b4 virus infection) or virus (coxsack b3 virus) at the beginning of the immune response after infection, the damage of the virus to the myocardial tissue can be directly damaged or damaged by the immune mechanism. when the viral rna persists in the myocardium, the t lymphocytes can infiltrate the myocardial tissue. studies have shown that low-level expression of viral genes can cause chronic progressive myocardial damage. when viral rna persists in the myocardium for more than 90 days, the myocardium may present pathological changes similar to dilated cardiomyopathy. when the body's defense ability is reduced, the body can be in a state of chronic virus carrying. in this chronic process, the virus can exist in the spleen, liver, pancreas and whole body lymph nodes. the harm is not the direct invasion of the myocardium, but the immunity of the body. the reaction; while the persistent presence of viral rna can still replicate, producing a large amount of viral rna that is non-invasive but antigenic, induces the body's immune response, causing myocardial damage. it is currently speculated that immune-mediated myocardial damage is an important mechanism of dcm. 1 humoral immunity: a variety of anti-myocardial autoantibodies can be detected in serum samples from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, including anti-mitochondrial adp/atp carrier antibodies, anti-汕1-adrenergic receptor antibodies, and anti-m2 cholinergic receptors. antibodies, anti-heat shock protein antibodies, anti-myosin heavy chain antibodies, branched chain alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase (bckd) complex antibodies and laminin antibodies, etc. autoantibodies play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. a. anti-mitochondrial adp/atp vector (ant) antibody: studies have found that ant and pathogen proteins share a common antigenic determinant, such as ant amino acid sequence 27-36 and coxsackie b3 virus arginine sequence 1218-1228, autoantibody production is caused by cross-reaction, and studies have suggested that viral infection causes mitochondrial isolation of antigen release, or changes in myocardial antigen properties, or activation of autoreactive t lymphocytes by bypass, thereby inducing autoimmune responses against mitochondria. anti-ant antibody can inhibit atp/adp transport of myocardial mitochondria, leading to myocardial cell energy metabolism disorder and impairing myocardial function. ant and calcanin may also have the same antigenic determinant. anti-ant antibody can interact with calcium channel protein on myocardial cell membrane. the combination inhibits calcium channel inactivation, promotes calcium influx, and overloads intracellular calcium, leading to degeneration and necrosis of cardiomyocytes. in other words, calcium overload caused by anti-ant antibody activation of ica is one of the causes of myocardial damage in dcm patients. b. anti-汕1-receptor antibody: 汕-receptor g protein-coupled membrane receptor, when 汕-receptor is activated by binding to neurohumoral transmitter, the receptor is invaded while producing physiological effects, and lysosomal fusion, proteolytic enzymes to degrade, lysosomes can bind to nuclear receptors containing major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules on the surface, if the receptor peptide produced after degradation can form with mhc molecules a complex that can be transported to the surface of the membrane, presented to the helper t lymphocyte (th) receptor, activates th, and activates th to interact with b lymphocytes to produce antibodies specific for the self-receptor polypeptide molecule. under normal circumstances, cardiomyocytes do not express mhc-like molecules, and only when they have immunological activity, they express mhc-like molecules. viral infection can induce cardiomyocytes to express mhc-like molecules, making cardiomyocytes become antigen-presenting cells, and viruses and the 汕-receptor molecule has a common antigenic determinant that can cause anti-beta receptor antibody production through a mimetic mechanism. anti-汕1 receptor antibodies activate ca2 channels of receptors, increase ca2 influx in cardiomyocytes, cause calcium overload, cause myocardial cell damage, and anti-汕1 receptor antibodies increase camp-dependent protein kinase (pk) activity in cardiomyocytes by binding to the 汕 receptor, the ratio of cytoplasmic to plasmid pk activity is significantly increased, resulting in cytoplasmic and plasmid camp-dependent pk activation, achieving positive degeneration, and some authors believe that anti-汕1-receptor antibodies can affect cardiomyocytes. the transmission of information causes the metabolism of cardiomyocytes regulated by the receptor to be disordered, and the number of 汕-receptors in the cardiomyocytes is down-regulated, and myocardial damage is induced. c. anti-myosin antibody: it is currently believed that there are two mechanisms that cause an immune response in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, producing anti-myosin antibodies: a. viral infection or other causes of myocardial tissue necrosis leading to myosin release and exposure, triggering the body's autoimmunity; b. viral molecules have similar antigenic determinants to myosin. d. anti-m2 cholinergic receptor antibody: m2 cholinergic receptor is a protein located on the membrane of cardiomyocytes, which belongs to the g protein-coupled membrane receptor, and synergizes with 汕-receptor to regulate myocardial adenylate cyclase. the activity and ion channel regulate cardiac function, while the anti-m2 cholinergic receptor antibody has a cholinergic-like effect, which can reduce the increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) concentration caused by isoproterenol in guinea pig ventricular muscle. slows the contraction frequency of ventricular myocytes, slows the maximum rate of increase in ventricular pressure, and slows heart rate. this inhibition by anti-m2 cholinergic receptor antibodies can be offset by the cholinergic antagonist atropine or by neutralizing antibodies. the production of the antibody may be caused by the activation of an autoimmune reaction by causing the m2 cholinergic receptor to become an autoantigen after viral infection. e. other antibodies: in addition to the above several anti-myocardial autoantibodies, anti-mitochondrial m7 antibodies, anti-bckd complex antibodies, anti-actin antibodies, anti-muscle atpase antibodies, etc. are also present in the serum of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. . although approximately 30% to 40% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have organ and disease-specific autoantibodies in their serum, some patients do not develop anti-autoantibodies, which may be related to several factors: a. dilated cardiomyopathy is a multifactorial disease, lack of autoantibodies to cause damage caused by cellular immunity or caused by other factors; b. autoantibodies of the heart may be early signs of the disease, disappear with the prolongation of the disease; c. different expansion different types of autoantibodies can occur in patients with cardiomyopathy, and negative results can be produced due to different detection methods and types of detection; d. the production of autoantibodies is related to human leukocyte antigens. 2 cellular immunity: in dilated cardiomyopathy, cell-mediated abnormal immune responses appear to impair lymphocyte function, alter the proportion of lymphocyte subsets and activate the immune cytokine system, and peripheral blood t cells in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy ( cd3), inhibitory/cytotoxic t cells (cd8) were significantly reduced, and there was no significant change in helper/inducible t cells (cd4). studies have shown that cytotoxic t lymphocytes have the effect of lysing virally infected cardiomyocytes in vitro, virus after infection, a polypeptide called t cell receptor can be present on the membrane of cardiomyocytes. t lymphocytes recognize and bind to this receptor, which can cause myocardial cell damage. application of anti-t cell receptor antibody can damage myocardial cells. in addition, natural killer cells can secrete a perforin, which causes the cardiomyocytes to form a pore-like lesion. the role of 3 cytokines: the level of inflammatory factors in serum of dcm patients was significantly increased, the ratio of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) 汐 / interleukin (il)-10 was positively correlated with plasma adrenaline levels; serum tnf receptor (stnfr) levels and left ventricular size was correlated; interleukin content was positively correlated with myocardial weight and degree of myocardial fibrosis. interferon gamma and tnf-汐 induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) on the surface of cardiomyocytes, the latter in the myocardium the role of cells and lymphocytes is linked. the family genetic predisposition of dilated cardiomyopathy is inferior to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but genetic factors still play a role. the family chain of dilated cardiomyopathy is more common than usual, and 20% of patients have first-degree relatives. evidence for dilated cardiomyopathy suggests that family inheritance is relatively common. typical familial cardiomyopathy is neuromuscular disease, such as duchenne muscular dystrophy, becker chronic progressive muscular dystrophy associated with x-linked inheritance, both of which are dystrophin genes (a cytoskeletal protein) mutation. recently, the absence of a cardiac catalyzed region associated with the dystrophin gene has been confirmed in a family with cardiomyopathy associated with x-linked inheritance but no skeletal muscle disease. it has been reported that mitochondria exist in familial cardiomyopathy. abnormalities, such as kearns-sagre syndrome: cardiomyopathy, ophthalmoplegia, retinopathy, and cerebellar ataxia, in addition to muscle protein and metabolic abnormalities, genetic factors also affect the triggering of anti-myocardial immune responses, members of the same family in the virus heart failure after infection or pregnancy, most familial cases are autosomal dominant, but the disease is genetically heterogeneous, has been reported autosomal recessive 49 and x-linked inheritance the promoter region of a type of familial x-linked dilated cardiomyopathy gene and the first outer code encoding dystrophin the latter protein is one of the components that make up the myocyte cytoskeleton. it is speculated that the deficiency of cardiac dystrophin caused by the above gene changes is the cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. in addition, mitochondria have also been reported. mutations in dna are still unknown as to whether the genetic susceptibility of dilated cardiomyopathy in patients without a significant family chain is present. a number of chromosomal loci associated with dominant inheritance of familial cardiomyopathy have been identified, including chromosome 1 (q32, p1-q1), chromosome 2 (q31), chromosome 5 (q33-34), chromosome 6. (q12-16), chromosome 9 (q13-22), chromosome 14 (q11), chromosome 15 (q14, q22), and the dominant site of dcm patients with mitral valve prolapse is located at 10 chromosome (q21-23). pathogenesis recent studies have shown that most dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with viral infection and autoimmune response. it has been found that viral myocarditis can evolve into dilated cardiomyopathy, which can be found in endocardial biopsy specimens of patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. enterovirus genes, serum of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy can detect a variety of anti-myocardial autoantibodies, such as anti-adp/atp carrier antibodies, anti-汕1 adrenergic receptor antibodies, anti-m2 cholinergic receptor antibodies and anti-muscle globulin heavy chain antibodies, etc., can also detect enterovirus gene fragments, viral infection and immune response damage theory is the main pathogenesis of current dilated cardiomyopathy, in addition, genetic factors may also play a role. dilated cardiomyopathy is the final result of myocardial damage caused by long-term effects of various factors (the main cause of dcm, infection or non-infectious myocarditis, alcoholism, metabolism, etc. may be related to the onset of dilated cardiomyopathy, short-lived myocardial injury (such as exposure to toxic substances) may be fatal to some cardiomyocytes, but the residual cardiomyocytes will increase the load and compensatory hypertrophy. this compensatory change can still be early. maintains the overall function of the heart, but will eventually manifest as myocardial contraction and diastolic dysfunction. myocarditis has both irreversible cardiomyocyte death and reversible myocardial inhibition mediated by cytokines, although certain factors (such as alcohol) are does not directly damage the cardiomyocytes, but can cause severe cardiac dysfunction if long-term effects, in addition, many injuries will also affect the heart's fibrous stent system, affecting myocardial compliance, and thus participate in the occurrence and development of ventricular enlargement.","['alternate pulse', 'stationary doctor', 'abdominal discomfort', 'heart failure', 'breathing difficulty', 'tidal breathing', 'arrhythmia', 'weakness', 'right heart dysfunction', ' heart enlargement', 'sit on the breath']","['sudden death', 'heart failure', 'pleural effusion', 'ascites', 'arrhythmia', 'atrial fibrillation']","['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['symptom treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
keshan disease,"keshandisease (keshandisease) is an unidentified disease characterized by cardiomyopathy, also known as endemic cardiomyopathy.first discovered in keshan county, heilongjiang province in 1935, it was named after keshan disease. in the past, the mortality rate of this disease was high. after the founding of new china, the disease was actively prevented, and the incidence and mortality of the disease were greatly reduced. some important progress has been made in prevention, treatment and etiology research. at present, the annual incidence rate has dropped below 0.07/100,000, and the incidence type has changed from emergency type to sub-acute type to potential type and slow type. mainly.a large number of epidemiology, pathological anatomy, clinical prevention and laboratory research results show that the disease is an independent endocardial disease.","(1) comprehensive preventive measures pay attention to environmental sanitation and personal hygiene, protect water sources, improve water quality, improve nutritional conditions, and prevent partial eclipse. especially for pregnant women, mothers and children, it is necessary to strengthen the supplement of protein, various vitamins and essential trace elements. including magnesium, iodine, etc., and prevention of kashin-beck disease, endemic thyroid disease. (2) popularized areas to promote preventive medication using sodium selenate as a preventive medication, after years of promotion, it can be proved that the incidence can be significantly reduced, usually once every 10 days, 1 to 5 years old 1mg, 6 to 10 years old 2mg, 11 ~15 years old 3mg, 16 years old and above 4mg, non-incidence season can be stopped for three months, getting rid of poverty and getting rich, improving the living standards of people in the ward, is also an important preventive measure. researchers have learned that the composition of food is different, and the prevalence rate is significantly different. the diet of keshan disease patients is low in beans, vegetables, animal foods, oils, etc. vitamin a, vitamin b12 and selenium are especially low. the content of calcium in food is also obviously insufficient. the observation results show that the improvement of diet has obvious preventive effect. it is proposed to change or improve the dietary composition of residents in the ward, reasonably arrange food supply, and rationalize the nutrition of residents, which will control the occurrence of keshan disease. (3) pay attention to rest and strengthen management according to the patient's heart function state, limit or avoid physical and mental activities, promote life rules, work and rest, rest can reduce the burden on the heart, promote the recovery of damaged myocardium, avoid upper respiratory tract infection and mental stimulation. patients with unstable conditions should be followed up for observation. in addition, it is recommended to use selenium-containing salt in the endemic areas, seed-soaked seeds in the rural areas, and selenium-containing fertilizers in the roots of the plants to increase the selenium content in the crops. [epidemiology] (1) in the epidemic area, this disease has occurred in foreign countries. north korea and japan have also reported that china mainly occurs in a transitional zone from northeast to southwest, namely heilongjiang, jilin, liaoning, inner mongolia, hebei, henan. shandong, shanxi, shaanxi, gansu, ningxia, sichuan, yunnan, tibet and other provinces and autonomous regions, the ward is mainly in the deserted hills, the plateau and the grassland in the rural areas, urban areas are less likely to occur. (2) in the onset season, the disease has obvious multiple and multiple seasons. in the northeast region, the incidence of acute patients is mostly in the cold winter, while in the southwest region, the hot summer is the best season. (3) population distribution the disease mainly occurs in rural young and middle-aged women and children. in the northeast and northwest regions, there are significantly more young and middle-aged women than men. in sichuan and yunnan, children aged 2-6 years are more common, and there is also a family. the number of people has been ill, according to the survey of epidemic areas, the number of agricultural population is high, while the urban population is rarely ill.","the study believes that the specific natural environment of the ward is related to the pathogenesis of keshan disease. the chemical substances in the environment act on the human body through the soil-soil chain. therefore, the research includes two aspects: one is the poisoning theory (including hydrazine, humic acid in water, nitrous acid). salt, etc.), the second is the lack of or imbalance in the chemical substances (selenium, magnesium, molybdenum) in the diet. according to the investigation, the disease has obvious regional characteristics. the soil, water quality and food in the ward lack some trace elements such as human body needs. selenium, molybdenum, magnesium, etc. or related nutrients, thereby interfering with myocardial metabolism, causing myocardial damage or rickets. some characteristics are consistent with the characteristics of biological factor infection. for example, many strains of virus can be isolated from keshan disease myocardial tissue, including coxsackie b virus. the results of serological research also indicate that there are about 1/3 of the acute type and 67.9%. the sub-acute keshan disease patients with double serum coxsackie b virus antibody was 4-fold increased with the isolated coxsackie b virus inoculated low-selenium suckling mice caused by myocardial lesions, damage and lesion detection the rate is also significantly higher than the normal selenium group. in addition to the direct cytolytic effect of the virus, the virus can induce cytotoxic t cells, b cells, and t helper cells to proliferate, so the pathogenesis of keshan disease is considered by biological etiology. low selenium may be the basic factor, and some cases may occur when there is a coxsackie b virus infection, and the resulting autoimmune reaction further aggravates myocardial damage. pathogenesis 1. pathogenesis (1) biogeochemical etiology: the theory believes that the cause of keshan disease exists in the soil and water of the ward, acts on the human body through the food chain, and causes myocardial loss through amino acid, vitamin and trace elements deficiency or imbalance. damage caused by illness. 1 internal and external environment low selenium: low internal and external environment selenium is closely related to the occurrence of keshan disease. a large number of studies have shown that keshan disease occurs in the low selenium zone, and the selenium content in the diseased area is significantly lower than that in the non-disease area, hair and blood. selenium content is significantly lower than that of non-disease residents, indicating that the selenium content in the environment outside the disease area is insufficient. more than 100,000 people in heilongjiang, shaanxi, sichuan and other places have taken oral sodium selenite to prevent keshan disease, and found that selenium supplementation is urgent. there is a significant effect on the onset of type and sub-acute keshan disease. in addition, there are metabolic changes in the keshan patient and the ward that are centered on low selenium, such as glutathione peroxidase in the tissues of patients and wards. the content of (gpx) was significantly lower than that of non-sick people; plasma lipid peroxide (mda), free fatty acid (ffa) and other components were significantly higher than non-disease areas; free radical content and hemoglobin oxidation rate in patients with red blood cells were significantly higher than non- patients, ward children are also higher than non-disease children, but low selenium can not fully explain all the epidemiological characteristics of keshan disease, such as not all low-selenium areas have keshan disease; although the disease area is generally low selenium, but the incidence is only occupy a small part of the disease; selenium levels in the ward do not change with the annual and seasonal occurrence of keshan disease; there is no significant difference in selenium and selenium in the hair between the sick and non-disease children in the same ward, therefore, currently it is believed that selenium deficiency is a very important regional factor in the pathogenesis of keshan disease, but it is not the only factor. 2 vitamin e (ve) deficiency: in recent years, it has been found that the content of alpha-tocopherol (汐-toco), which has the strongest antioxidant activity in ve components, is generally lower than that in non-disease areas, and it is also confirmed the total amount of 汐-toco and ve in the plasma of the population (including patients with keshan disease and healthy people) was significantly lower than that of non-disease healthy people. the total amount of 汐-toco and ve in the erythrocyte membrane was also significantly lower than that of non-patients. normal people in the ward, indicating that patients with keshan disease are generally in a low ve state, the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) in the ward are generally higher than those in the non- ward, and the ratio of 汐-toco (mg) to pufas (g) is generally low. in non-disease areas, pufas in living organisms depend on the protection of ve, suggesting that there may be a relative deficiency of 汐-toco in the ward, which further reduces the body's antioxidant capacity. 3 proteins and amino acids: the intake of animal and plant protein in the ward is significantly lower than that in the non-disease area; the content of essential amino acids in the ward is lower than that in the non- ward, and the sulfur-containing amino acids in the plasma of the ward (s-aa) as methionine deficiency, selenomethionine ingested from the diet instead of methionine is involved in protein synthesis, resulting in selenium not functioning properly. s-aa is also a precursor of glutathione, and its insufficient intake will lead to valleys. the synthesis of glutathione is not only a specific substrate for gpx reaction, but also a free radical scavenger. it can be seen that low selenium, insufficient s-aa intake and low ve can cause antioxidant capacity in the body. decline. 4 dietary high manganese: previous studies have shown that in most low selenium areas, there are relatively high manganese phenomena in the internal and external environment. experiments show that when the protein supply is insufficient, exogenous manganese can accumulate in the body, resulting in increased selenium excretion and decreased selenium content. it affects the antioxidant capacity of cells, especially red blood cells and myocardium, and the combination of selenium-depleted and manganese-rich, and affect each other, can further reduce the antioxidant capacity of the myocardium and aggravate myocardial damage. 5 dietary low calcium: the residents in the ward have a single diet, and the calcium intake is not obvious. animal experiments have found that low calcium can aggravate myocardial necrosis caused by low selenium. therefore, dietary low calcium may also be important in the combined pathogenic factors of keshan disease. role, this can explain why keshan disease occurs mostly in women of growth and children who have a large amount of calcium. (2) biological etiology: 1 enterovirus: a variety of viruses can be isolated from the blood of keshan disease patients and the myocardium and other organs of the deceased, such as coxsackie virus a9, b1, b2, b3, b4, etc. echovirus type 12, adenovirus type 7, etc., serological investigation found that keshan disease patients with intestinal virus neutralizing antibody positive rate is much higher than non-disease control group, only coxsackie b virus neutralizing antibody the positive rate was as high as 68.6%-90%, and it was found that about 1/3 of the sub-acute type, the antibody titer of the acute patient increased by 4 times, and the positive rate of coxsackie virus igm in the serum of the child was as high as 69.4%, indicating that it was large. some patients with keshan disease have newly developed enterovirus infection. domestic in situ nucleic acid hybridization and nested polymerase chain reaction techniques have found that there are intestinal viral rnas in all types of keshan disease myocardial specimens. at 85.7% and 90%, these findings suggest that attention should be paid to the role of enteroviruses, particularly coxsackie b virus infection, in the pathogenesis of keshan disease. foreign animal experiments have shown that in the absence of selenium and low ve, mice are more susceptible to coxsackie virus, in the coxsackie virus infection, low ve conditions of the myocardium, it can be seen that the disease changes severely; usually does not cause myocarditis benign the strain cvb3/0 also caused myocardial lesions in mice with low ve; at the same time, the virus isolated from the myocardium, when inoculated by cells to mice that had been supplemented with ve, also caused significant myocardial damage, indicating benign cvb3/0 may have a phenotypic change under low ve conditions, and selenium deficiency has a similar situation. for example, the nucleotide sequence analysis of cvb3 and benign cvb3/0 isolated from the selenium-deficient mouse myocardium shows that there are 6 (p. 234, 788, 2271, 2438, 3324, 7334) nucleotides undergo point mutations, and these mutations are consistent with the nucleotide sequence of the known myocarditis strain cvb3/20, cvb3/m1, selenium protein such as gpx can be synthesized not only by higher biological cells but also by cvb3, while the partial amino acid sequence of gpx is homologous to cvb3, and the fusion protein can be formed with the capsid protein vp3. the above-mentioned selenium-deficient or selenoproteinase knock-out cvb3 /0 mutation site has it is located in this area, therefore, it was speculated that disease-causing mutant may also function with this gpx fusion protein inactivation. 2 fusarium oxysporum: some people extracted the beetle oxysporum from the ward, and speculated that the food contamination of fusarium oxysporum was the cause of keshan disease, but fusarium oxysporum was found in both keshan disease and non-disease areas. distribution, and not the dominant bacteria; the difference between the different types of grain contamination is greater than the difference between the same type of food in the diseased and non-disease areas; the pollution distribution is not consistent with the regional distribution of keshan disease; the toxicity of fusarium was not related to the selenium status of the infected subjects. selenium supplementation or supplementation of ve did not inhibit or reduce the toxicity of fusarium oxysporum, which was inconsistent with the practice of selenium prevention of keshan disease; myocardial enzymology and pathological changes similar to keshan disease have not been seen in myocardial damage. therefore, the role of fusarium oxysporum in the etiology of keshan disease is still to be further explored. in conclusion, it is currently believed that keshan disease is an endemic cardiomyopathy caused by compound pathogenic factors. the basic cause is due to the superposition of biogeochemical factors and dietary nutrition factors, resulting in low selenium and closely related ve (汐). - tocopherol) insufficient intake, low selenium, low ve generally affects people in the ward, usually only cause myocardial metabolic disorders or potential subclinical damage, to cause myocardial sharp necrosis and clinical morbidity, there must be some predisposing factors ( conditional factors) participation, these factors do not have obvious regional differences, but can play an important role in the clinical onset of keshan disease, annual multiple, seasonal multiple, such as coxsackie virus infection is an important condition factor. 2. a large number of autopsy confirmed that the pathological features of keshan disease in northeast china, north china, northwest china and southwest china were basically the same. metabolic cardiomyopathy was mainly caused by mitochondrial damage of myocardial cells. sexual expansion, the ventricle generally expands to the sides, severely spherical, ventricular wall often does not thicken, the cut surface sees the myocardial parenchyma intertwined degeneration, necrosis and fibrotic lesions, endocardial patchy thickening, 20% the patient has a wall thrombus and embolism of the lung, brain, kidney, spleen, mesentery and peripheral blood vessels. the heart valve and coronary artery are basically normal. under light microscope, diffuse degeneration and focal necrosis of myocardial cells can be seen, with left ventricle and ventricular septum. more common, and the degree is heavier, while the right ventricle is lighter; the ventricle is heavier than the atrium; the inner chamber, the middle layer is heavier than the outer layer; the acute type of keshan disease subendocardial myocardial necrosis can reach 95%, but the child's ventricle is outside the lesions of the layer are heavier than the endocardium. the myocardial lesions are closely related to the progressive branching of the coronary arteries. in children with subacute type, the myocardial cells are granular degeneration, and there may be vacuolar degeneration of varying sizes. row sterilization of myocardial necrosis due to neat degeneration, coagulopathy and lytic necrosis can be mixed in the same lesion, in which acute septic type is mainly coagulative necrosis, while subacute type is mainly lytic necrosis, often accompanied by different degrees of secondary inflammatory reaction, lesions can invade the conduction system, and bilateral bundle branches, especially right bundle branch disease, change severely. electron microscopy mainly showed mitochondrial swelling, hyperplasia, mitochondrial mites destruction, myocardial cell outer membrane damage and capillary endothelial damage. combined with histochemical analysis, it can be seen that this pathological change is related to myocardial cell oxidation and reductive metabolic system disorders. disease is a primary metabolic cardiomyopathy (myocardial mitochondrial disease) characterized by myocardial cell mitochondrial damage. endocardial myocardial biopsy is used to observe the myocardium of latent and slow keshan disease. the membrane system of the cells has been significantly altered, endoplasmic reticulum, t-tube, sacral disc expansion, mitochondrial hyperplasia, atypical, abnormal myofibrils and microscopic myolysis and interstitial fibrosis. using molecular biology techniques, apoptotic cardiomyocytes are distributed around or scattered in the myocardial lesions, suggesting that cardiomyocyte apoptosis is also involved in the occurrence and development of myocardial damage. in addition to the myocardium, other organs such as skeletal muscle, lung, pancreas, and thyroid are mostly congestive changes.","['face of darkness', 'upper abdominal discomfort', 'breathing difficulty', 'appetite loss', 'chest tightness', 'abdominal pain', 'dizziness', 'dizziness', 'disgusting', 'breathing', 'shuai hailin' ]","['arrhythmia', 'hypokalemia', 'cardiac shock', 'congestive heart failure']","['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
raynaud's disease,"raynaud syndrome refers to paroxysmal spasm of the extremity artery.it is often caused by factors such as cold irritation or emotional agitation, which is characterized by intermittent pale, purpura and flushing changes in the skin color of the extremities.generally, the upper limbs are heavier and occasionally seen in the lower limbs. most occur in the 20 to 40 years old, more women than men.the onset is slow, starting with a winter attack, a short time, and gradually appearing cold or emotional excitement.usually more symmetrical hand finger attacks, toes can also occur. the hands and feet are cold, numb, and occasionally painful.in a typical episode, with the metacarpophalangeal joint as the boundary, the fingers are cold, pale, purple, and then flushed.in the late stage of the disease, the hair on the back of the finger disappears gradually, the nail grows slowly, rough, deformed, the skin shrinks and becomes thin (scleroderma refers to), ulcers form around the fingertip or nail bed, and can cause infection.","avoid cold irritations and emotional excitement; avoid smoking; avoid the use of ergotamine, beta-blockers and birth control pills; those who are obviously caused by occupational reasons (long-term use of vibrating tools, work at low temperatures) should be changed as much as possible, careful protect your fingers from trauma, and cause fingertip ulcers or other nutritional diseases due to minor injuries. drinking a small amount of alcoholic beverages in daily life can improve symptoms. if conditions permit, people can move to a mild climate, dry areas, and reduce symptoms. relieving the patient's mental concerns and maintaining optimism are all important measures in prevention.","1, the central nervous system dysfunction, so that sympathetic nerve function. 2. the levels of adrenaline and norepinephrine in the blood circulation are increased. 3, the condition is often aggravated in the menstrual period, the gestation period is reduced, so some people think that it is related to endocrine. 4, the defects of the limb arteriole itself, caused by excessive reaction to normal physiological phenomena. 5. some people think that the early stage is that the aortic arterioles have an overreaction to the cold. later, due to long-term vasospasm, the intima of the arteries is proliferated and the blood flow is not smooth. if there is any reduction in the blood flow of the aortic arterioles, a physiological factor can act on the diseased artery to cause an attack. 6, patients often have a family history, suggesting that may be related to heredity. 7, immune and connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, nodular polyarteritis, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, mixed connective tissue disease, hepatitis b antigen vasculitis, vasculitis caused by drugs, and sjogren syndrome. 8, obstructive arterial disease, such as occlusive arteriosclerosis, thromboembolic vasculitis. 9, physical factors, such as shock damage, direct arterial trauma, cold damage. 10, caused by certain drugs, such as ergot, lead, bismuth, arsenic and other poisoning, polyvinyl chloride, 汕-blockers, cytotoxic drugs, contraceptives and so on. 11. factors affecting neurovascular mechanisms such as cervical ribs, anterior scalene muscle syndrome, thoracic, exit syndrome, improper use of crutches, compression of the ankle, tumor compression of the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, cervical spondylitis or nucleus pulposus rupture, peripheral nerves inflammation, syringomyelia or spinal cord spasm. 12, increased blood agglutinin or cryoglobulinemia, polycythemia vera, paroxysmal hemoglobinuria and so on. 13. some are associated with migraine and varicose angina.","['skin partial skin...', 'nail bed bun', 'hand skin is purple', 'redness and swelling of the back of the hand', 'nails appear blue-purple', 'finger cyanosis or necrosis', 'after sleep finger appears numb...']",['septicemia'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['chinese and western medicine combined with local treatment of physical therapy', 'chinese medicine bubble wash']"
chronic pulmonary heart disease,"chronic pulmonary heart disease refers to a chronic disease caused by bronchopulmonary-tissue, thoracic or pulmonary vasculature, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular structure or (and) functional changes in heart disease, and exclusion of congenital caused by sexual heart disease and left heart disease.there is a regional difference in the prevalence of chronic pulmonary heart disease. the north is higher than the southern region, the rural area is higher than the urban area, and increases with age. the prevalence of smokers is significantly higher than that of non-smokers. arrhythmia and right heart failure may occur. severe pulmonary disease can occur, shock.chronic pulmonary heart disease often has repeated episodes, and the condition gradually worsens. most of the prognosis is poor, but active treatment can prolong life and improve patients' quality of life.","1. since most chronic pulmonary heart disease is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), chronic bronchitis, and bronchial asthma complicated by emphysema, active prevention and treatment of these diseases is a fundamental measure to avoid the occurrence of chronic pulmonary heart disease. 2. pay attention to hygiene, quit smoking and enhance physical fitness, improve systemic resistance, reduce the occurrence of colds and various respiratory diseases. respiratory tract infection is a common cause of respiratory failure in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease and should be treated actively. 3. for patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease, they should be treated separately for remission and acute phase. remission treatment is the key to prevent the development of chronic pulmonary heart disease. it can be used: 1 cold water, sputum breathing, lip respiration to improve cold tolerance and rehabilitation exercises such as lung ventilation. 2 antitussive, expectorant, anti-asthmatic and prevent infections and other symptomatic treatment. 3 drugs to improve the body's immunity such as nucleic acid casein, bronchitis bacterin, immune ribonucleic acid and so on. 4 chinese medicine treatment: fuzheng guben, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, in order to improve the body's resistance and improve lung circulation.","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) caused by chronic obstructive emphysema is the most common. copd is the most common cause of senile pulmonary heart disease, followed by bronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, severe tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, chronic diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (including idiopathic pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and secondary pulmonary fibrosis) ), pulmonary radiation therapy, sarcoidosis, allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic granuloma, cryptogenic diffuse interstitial pneumonia, alveolar hard rock disease. less common, severe posterior spine, scoliosis, spinal tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, extensive pleural adhesions and severe thoracic or spinal deformities caused by thoracoplasty, severe pleural hypertrophy, obesity with inadequate pulmonary ventilation, sleep breathing disorders and neuromuscular diseases such as polio can cause thoracic activity limitation, lung compression, bronchial distortion or deformation, resulting in limited lung function, poor airway drainage, repeated lung infection, emphysema, or fiber chemotherapy, hypoxia, pulmonary vasoconstriction, stenosis, increased resistance, pulmonary hypertension, development into pulmonary heart disease. rarely, allergic granulomatosis involving the pulmonary artery, extensive or recurrent multiple pulmonary embolism and pulmonary arteritis, and unexplained primary pulmonary hypertension can narrow and block the pulmonary arterioles. caused by increased pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular overload, develop into pulmonary heart disease, occasionally in the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein compression, such as mediastinal tumors, aneurysms, etc., can also be seen in primary pulmonary hypertension. repeated pulmonary infection, hypoxemia and toxemia may cause myocardial damage and arrhythmia, and even heart failure; primary alveolar ventilation and congenital oropharyngeal malformations, sleep apnea syndrome, etc. can also lead to pulmonary origin sexual heart disease; others can be seen after pneumonectomy and high altitude hypoxia, these diseases can produce hypoxemia, increase pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading to pulmonary hypertension, develop into pulmonary heart disease. in addition, sputum poisoning, progressive systemic sclerosis, disseminated lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, etc. can also induce the disease. pathogenesis 1. pathogenesis: pulmonary capillary bed destruction in chronic pulmonary and thoracic diseases reduces the area of vascular bed, hypoxia caused by airflow obstruction and respiratory acidosis can cause pulmonary arteriolar spasm, secondary to chronic hypoxia factors such as erythrocytosis and increased blood viscosity can lead to increased pulmonary circulation resistance, pulmonary hypertension, right heart load, right ventricular hypertrophy, and development of pulmonary heart disease. (1) pulmonary hypertension: pulmonary hypertension (pah) is an important pathophysiological stage of chronic pulmonary heart disease. in the early stage of pulmonary hypertension, if the cause can be removed in time, or symptomatic treatment is appropriate, it is possible to reverse the lesion or block. further development of the lesion; in the advanced stage of pulmonary hypertension, the lesion is in an irreversible stage and the treatment is difficult. 1 pulmonary vascular organic changes: repeated peri-bronchitis, interstitial inflammation, which affects the branching of adjacent pulmonary arterioles, resulting in thickening of the arterial wall, stenosis or fibrosis, greatly reducing the area of pulmonary capillary bed, lung circulation resistance increase, long-term pulmonary circulation resistance increase, can make small arteries hyperplasia and hypertrophy, increase pulmonary circulation resistance, resulting in a vicious circle. in the factors affecting pulmonary hypertension, the reduction of pulmonary vascular bed area has a certain effect, but if the degree is light, the range smaller, the increase in pulmonary artery pressure is not obvious, only when the area of the pulmonary capillary bed is reduced by more than 70%, the pulmonary artery pressure is significantly increased. when there is obvious emphysema in severe copd, the alveoli are over-inflated, and most of the alveolar spaces are ruptured and fused to form a bullous bullous, which also leads to a decrease in the alveolar wall capillary bed, an increase in the alveolar residual gas in the emphysema, and an increase in the alveolar pressure. the capillaries of the alveolar wall are compressed to narrow it. in addition, obstructive emphysema, the patient's expiratory phase is significantly prolonged, up to 5 times the inspiratory phase, and the pressure in the alveoli during exhalation is significantly increased, and the lung wall is compressed. blood vessels and heart, so that the blood of the pulmonary artery can not be perfused smoothly, can also affect pulmonary artery pressure. in addition, pulmonary vascular diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension, recurrent pulmonary vascular embolism, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, etc., can cause pulmonary vascular stenosis, occlusion, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance, the development of pulmonary hypertension. 2 pulmonary vascular functional changes: hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which is the most extensive and in-depth mechanism of current research, which can be summarized as the following aspects. a. humoral factors: pulmonary inflammation can activate inflammatory cells including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils and macrophages, releasing a range of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin (5-ht), angiotensin 11 (at-ii), and arachidonic acid (aa) metabolites, including leukotrienes, thromboxane (txa2), prostaglandin f2 (pgf2), prostacyclin (pgl2), and prostaglandin e1 ( pge1), etc., except for pgl2 and pge1 causing pulmonary vasodilation, all of the above mediators cause pulmonary vasoconstriction. however, the contraction response of pulmonary vessels to hypoxia depends to a large extent on the proportion of local vasoconstrictor and vasodilator media. if the vasoconstrictor medium increases, the proportion increases, which may lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction. b. tissue factors: hypoxia can directly increase the permeability of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle membrane to ca2, increase ca2 influx, increase muscle excitability-contraction coupling, cause pulmonary vasoconstriction, and alveolar co2 partial pressure (pac02) ascending can cause local pulmonary vasoconstriction and bronchodilation, in order to adjust the ratio of ventilation/blood flow, and ensure the oxygenation of pulmonary vein blood. there is an imbalance of pulmonary adrenergic receptors after hypoxia, which makes the contraction of pulmonary blood vessels predominate. c. neurological factors: hypoxia and hypercapnia can stimulate carotid sinus and aortic chemoreceptors, reflexively through sympathetic excitation, increased secretion of catecholamines, and contraction of pulmonary arteries. 3 pulmonary vascular reconstruction: pulmonary vascular changes in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension are mainly manifested in the myometrium of less than 60 米m non-muscle pulmonary arterioles, thickening of the pulmonary arterioles greater than 60 米m, intimal fibrosis, subendometrial the longitudinal muscle bundle appears, as well as the increase of elastic fibers and collagen fibrous matrix, which makes the blood vessels hard and the resistance increases. the structural changes of these pulmonary vessels are called remodeling, and the mechanism may be under the action of stimulating factors such as hypoxia. , a variety of growth factors produced inside and outside the lungs, resulting in a series of changes. 4 increased blood volume and increased blood viscosity: severe copd can occur chronic chronic hypoxia, increased erythropoietin secretion, resulting in increased secondary erythropoiesis, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, copd patients also have pulmonary capillary bed area reduced and decreased pulmonary vascular compliance, the compensatory expansion of vascular volume is significantly limited, and thus pulmonary blood flow can increase, can cause pulmonary hypertension. (2) changes in right heart function: the factors affecting right heart function in chronic lung disease are mainly due to the increase of right heart and back load caused by pulmonary hypertension. after the increase of right ventricular afterload, the myocardial oxygen consumption is increased due to the increase of ventricular wall tension; increased arterial resistance, decreased blood flow; increased pulmonary vascular input impedance, decreased compliance and impaired right heart function. in addition, hypoxemia has direct damage to the myocardium, right ventricular in the case of chronic stress overload, right the walls of the chamber are hypertrophied to overcome the increased afterload to maintain normal pump function. when the respiratory tract is infected, the hypoxia is aggravated, or other causes cause the pulmonary artery pressure to increase further than the right ventricle can afford, the right ventricle discharges blood is not complete, the residual blood remaining in the end of systole is too much, and the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure is increased. the right ventricular dilatation is aggravated, eventually leading to heart failure. 2. pathology (1) major primary lesions in the lungs: although the causes of chronic pulmonary heart disease are diverse, the majority of the primary primary diseases of chronic pulmonary heart disease in china are chronic bronchitis and obstructive emphysema. . (2) pulmonary vascular lesions: in chronic pulmonary heart disease, it is often observed that: 1 the wall of the pulmonary artery is thickened and the lumen is narrowed or occluded. 2 the destruction and reduction of the capillary wall of the alveolar wall is not only a manifestation of chronic pulmonary heart disease, but also an important reason for aggravating and promoting the development of chronic pulmonary heart disease. 3 compression of the pulmonary vascular bed, extensive fibrosis of the lungs, contraction of scar tissue, severe emphysema, etc. can compress the pulmonary blood vessels to make them deform and twist. (3) heart disease: in chronic pulmonary heart disease, the main lesions of the heart are increased heart weight, right heart hypertrophy, right ventricular muscle thickening, ventricular cavity enlargement, pulmonary artery conization, apical bluntness, light microscopic observation, common heart muscle fibers showed varying degrees of hypertrophic changes, characterized by thickening of myocardial fibers, deep nuclear staining, irregular shape, square or rectangular, myocardial fibers with focal sarcoplasmic lysis or focal myocardial fibrosis or fibrosis, between the myocardium quality edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis of the atrioventricular bundle, small infiltration of small fat, small blood vessel dilation, reduction of conduction beam fibers, extensive pathological edema, hyperemia, focal or punctiform hemorrhage, multiple necrosis under electron microscope, the cell mitochondria is swollen, the endoplasmic reticulum is dilated, the sarcomere is dissolved or the length is different, and the glycogen is reduced or disappeared.","['insomnia', 'right heart failure', 'respiratory failure', 'confusion of consciousness', 'wheeling sound', 'difficulty breathing', 'arrhythmia', 'wheezing', 'heart sputum', 'sit-sitting breathing' ]","['heart failure', 'multiple lung infections', 'respiratory failure', 'pulmonary encephalopathy', 'arrhythmia', 'shock', 'diffuse intravascular coagulation', 'upper gastrointestinal bleeding', 'more organ dysfunction syndrome]","['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
ischemic cardiomyopathy,"ischemic cardiomyopathy ( icm) is a special type or late stage of coronary heart disease, which refers to long-term myocardial ischemia caused by coronary atherosclerosis, resulting in diffuse fibrosis of the myocardium, resulting in primary dilatation. similar clinical syndromes of cardiomyopathy, with the increasing incidence of coronary heart disease, the harm caused by icm to human health is also becoming more serious.in 1995, who/isfc defined ischemic cardiomyopathy as: manifested as dilated cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction, but could not be explained by the degree of coronary artery disease and the degree of ischemic damage.","because the main cause of ischemic cardiomyopathy is coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, it is important to prevent coronary heart disease in the prevention of this disease. the main measures are as follows: 1. conduct health education for the population, improve citizens' self-care awareness, avoid or change bad habits, quit smoking, pay attention to reasonable diet, exercise properly, maintain psychological balance, etc., reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, middle-aged and above, with a light diet it is advisable to reduce animal fat, quit smoking, drink a little alcohol, not drink or drink too much, exercise properly, and patients who have suffered from heartache should be treated for a long time. when heartache occurs, they should be treated promptly. patients with myocardial infarction, after heartache absolute bed rest for two weeks, then gradually resume activities, sit up on the bed, gradually extend the sitting time, one week later, you can go to the bedside activities, to recover physical strength, outdoor activities, for patients with myocardial infarction, give some liquid food in the first two weeks, or semi-liquid food is suitable, but also pay attention to the smooth flow of the stool, when the solution is not available, for patients with myocardial infarction, it is necessary to closely observe the condition, when the condition changes, it should be treated in time. 2. regular routine physical examination, early detection of high incidence of coronary heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high blood lipids, diabetes, obesity, smoking and family history of coronary heart disease, etc., give active control and treatment.","(1) common causes of ischemic cardiomyopathy: 1. coronary artery resistance lesions (1) coronary atherosclerosis: the most common cause of myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis is the arterial wall the results of a series of complex interactions between cells, extracellular matrices, blood components, local hemodynamics, environmental and genetic factors, and epidemiological studies have shown that the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis is affected by a combination of factors. among them, elevated blood pressure, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, elevated fibrinogen and smoking are the main risk factors for atherosclerosis, excessive eating, obesity or overweight, lack of physical activity, type a personality and early stage the family history of coronary heart disease is also a risk factor for coronary heart disease. under these risk factors, vascular endothelial injury or exfoliation occurs in the coronary arteries, endometrial permeability is enhanced, and a small amount of plasma lipids invade into the subendosphere. cells, mesangial smooth muscle cells proliferate and enter the intima, these proliferating monocytes and smooth muscle cells phagocytose large amounts of lipids under the endothelium lipid-rich foam cells, followed by increased lipids that invade the endothelium, more and more foam cells that phagocytose a large number of lipids, and gradually disintegrate, thereby depositing a large number of lipids under the intima to form a lipid pool. with the disintegration of foam cells and the release of lipids, the lipid pool is gradually expanding. among them, in addition to cholesterol, there are cholesterol crystals, neutral fats, phospholipids and disintegrating cell debris, which are lipid spots and lipids under the endothelium. streaks gradually develop into atheromatous plaques. these atheromatous substances stimulate the surrounding tissues to fibrosis to form fibrous caps, and can also form calcification to make the plaques hard. when atheromatous plaques protrude into the vascular lumen, coronary atherosclerosis can be gradually formed. the sclerosing stenosis, while the lipids and necrotic substances in the plaque can rupture to the surface of the endometrium, forming atherosclerotic ulcers, bleeding or thrombosis can occur on the surface of the ulcer, causing myocardial ischemia and even infarction caused by further narrowing of the lumen. patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, especially congestive ischemic cardiomyopathy, often have significant atherosclerotic stenosis in multiple coronary arteries. it has been reported that 71 patients with 3 vascular lesions account for 71% of the disease. vascular lesions accounted for 27%, single-vessel disease is rare, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy have a history of multiple and/or multiple myocardial infarctions, and angina symptoms are more common, atkinson in 35 ischemic myocardium in the autopsy results, an average of 2.2% of the coronary arteries with a stenosis of more than 75% were found, of which 26 had evidence of myocardial infarction, 9 had no pathological manifestations of myocardial infarction, and edward found that 14 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy were found at autopsy. 100% of patients have myocardial infarction, it is due to severe coronary stenosis caused by long-term perfusion of a large range of myocardial insufficiency, myocardial function decline, and even myocardial degeneration, necrosis, myocardial fibrosis, ventricular wall replaced by large scar tissue, ventricle hypertrophy, enlargement, decreased myocardial contractility and decreased ventricular compliance, leading to cardiac insufficiency. (2) thrombosis: recent studies have confirmed that coronary artery acute thrombosis is the main cause of acute transmural myocardial infarction, but thrombosis occurs on the basis of atherosclerotic plaque, local plaque of thrombus 3/4 had rupture and/or bleeding. beijing tongwai hospital had an autopsy for 31 cases of acute myocardial infarction. twenty-one patients with coronary artery thrombosis were found to have a thrombus detection rate of 74.1%. all autopsy proved that all thrombus all of them are blocked at the proximal end of the large branch of the coronary artery. the penetrating infarction has a wider range. the complications of left heart failure or cardiogenic shock are more common. some patients have thrombolytic recanalization, and a few patients have thrombosis and cause blood vessels. in the persistent occlusion or stenosis of the cavity, in the survivors after the recovery of the acute phase, more patients will have extensive wall motion disappeared or weakened, and the ventricular cavity is obviously enlarged. (3) vasculitis: a variety of rheumatic diseases can involve coronary arterial coronary artery disease, repeated activities, repair, mechanization can cause coronary stenosis, leading to myocardial ischemia, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, nodular polyarteritis, viral coronary arteritis, etc., especially nodular polyarteritis, also known as nodular periarteritis or polyarteritis, is a major involvement of small and medium arteries necrotizing vasculitis, lesions can be segmental, occur in the bifurcation of the arteries, extending down to the small arteries, easy to form small aneurysms, inflammatory cell infiltration in all layers of the blood vessel wall, intimal hyperplasia, degeneration , necrosis and granulation formation, lumen shrinkage, occlusion, tube wall is often replaced by fibrous tissue, about 60% of patients with nodular polyarteritis can develop coronary arteritis, cause myocardial ischemia, can induce angina and (or) myocardial infarction and even cause ischemic cardiomyopathy. (4) others: factors that can cause chronic myocardial ischemia include coronary microvascular disease (x syndrome) and abnormal coronary structure, such as muscle bridge, human coronary artery trunk and its large branches, mainly walking in pericardium in the lower adipose tissue or in the deep surface of the pericardial visceral layer, sometimes they are covered by the superficial myocardium. after walking a distance in the myocardium, they are shallow to the surface of the myocardium. this segment of the artery covered by the myocardium is called the wall coronary artery. the part of the myocardium that covers the coronary artery is called the muscle bridge. the intimal layer of the wall coronary artery is thinner than the proximal and distal endometrium, and there is little or almost no atherosclerotic lesion, but when the muscle bridge compression of the coronary artery surrounded by contraction can lead to severe coronary stenosis, affecting local myocardial blood supply, resulting in myocardial ischemia. 2. coronary artery dynamic lesions under the action of humoral and neurological factors, vascular smooth muscle reactivity is abnormally enhanced, and vasospasm occurs. especially in the presence of atherosclerosis, the extensive blood vessels often show a slow relaxation response. can cause vasomotor dysfunction, leading to increased myocardial ischemia, when the formation of coronary atherosclerotic plaque, the stenosis area is not static, most of the human coronary atherosclerotic plaque is eccentric stenosis, which means there is still a part of the normal arterial wall in the stenosis, which will make the lumen smaller due to the contraction of smooth muscle. due to the incompressibility of the plaque tissue, if the outer diameter is reduced by the increase of vascular smooth muscle tension, the effect on the lumen will be it is very huge. for example, if the diameter of the lumen has been reduced by 50% due to plaque, if the diameter of the vascular smooth muscle tendon is reduced by 10%, the stenosis of the lumen will increase. by 80% to 85%, the stenosis of the transverse section will be more than 95%. through research, many factors have been involved in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle contraction. for example, adrenergic alpha receptor agonism, local platelet aggregation and release of thromboxane a2 (txa2), and hypercholesterolemia or local atherosclerotic lesions can cause abnormal vascular reactivity, and ergometrine is the most effective drug for inducing sputum. both nitroglycerin and calcium channel antagonists can effectively alleviate this problem. (b) the pathogenesis 1. myocardial blood oxygen supply and demand balance imbalance due to the heart's non-stop systolic activity, myocardial oxygen demand is relatively high, and the myocardium can not be as long as the skeletal muscle anaerobic exercise, the resulting oxygen debt after repayment, the myocardium must undergo aerobic respiration. therefore, even in a quiet state, the myocardium should take 75% of available oxygen from the coronary circulation, which has reached the maximum oxygen uptake, ischemic cardiomyopathy. the main pathogenesis is long-term myocardial ischemia, myocardial blood supply is affected by myocardial oxygen consumption and myocardial oxygen supply, while myocardial ischemia is insufficient myocardial oxygen supply to meet myocardial oxygen demand, so that blood oxygen a result of a loss of balance between supply and demand. (1) factors determining myocardial oxygen consumption: the amount of myocardial oxygen consumption depends on the following six factors: ventricular wall tension during systole, continuous tension interval, myocardial contractility and basal metabolism, electrical activation and myocardial fiber shortening, among which the first three are the decisive factors determining the amount of myocardial oxygen consumption. the latter three are secondary factors, systolic wall tension = systolic ventricular volume G intraluminal pressure ˉ wall thickness; and tension duration = heart rate G systolic ejection time, so when the left ventricular systolic pressure, volume or wall thickness increases; or heart rate increases; or myocardial contractility increases, myocardial oxygen consumption increases, in practical applications, measuring all these indicators is not easy, therefore, the ""double product"" of systolic blood pressure and heart rate is commonly used as the myocardial oxygen consumption index in clinical practice. this method is simple and reliable. (2) factors determining myocardial oxygen supply: the oxygen supply of the myocardium depends on the oxygen uptake and delivery. the most important factor determining the oxygen supply of the myocardium is the blood flow of the coronary artery, because the myocardium has been extracted to the utmost extent. oxygen in the coronary blood flow, so when the myocardial oxygen demand increases, it can only increase the oxygen uptake by increasing the coronary blood flow. the coronary blood flow and the perfusion pressure difference are the proximal coronary artery and the right atrium. the pressure difference is proportional to the coronary artery resistance. according to the difference of the main effects, the coronary artery can be divided into two sections, which are located on the surface of the pericardial visceral layer. the lumen of the blood vessel is thicker and mainly transmits blood flow. the effect, which produces only a small resistance, is called ""transmission of blood vessels""; this part of the blood vessels gradually branches into smaller blood vessels into the anterior capillary vessels after entering the myocardium. this part of the blood vessel diameter changes from the resistance of the whole coronary circulation. a decisive role, referred to as ""resistance vessels"", specifically, factors affecting the coronary blood flow are: ｋ effects cardiac cycle by: left ventricular blood flow the amount is affected by the cardiac cycle. the blood flow to the left ventricular myocardium during systole is only 7% to 45% of the diastolic phase. this is mainly due to the compression of the resistance vessels in the myocardium during left ventricular contraction due to the right ventricular ventricle. the muscle is thinner and less affected by the cardiac cycle, and the blood flow to the right ventricle is almost the same during the systolic and diastolic phases. 2 influenced by innervation: 汐-receptors and 汕-receptors are distributed on the wall of coronary vessels, and when the 汐-receptors are excited, coronary artery contraction including resistance vessels and blood vessels is caused to cause blood flow. increased resistance, and excitatory 汕-receptors can cause coronary dilation, which increases coronary blood flow. if 汕-receptor block, 汐-receptor causes coronary artery contraction to be more pronounced. 3 affected by myocardial metabolites: some metabolites produced during myocardial metabolism affect coronary blood flow, including oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, potassium ions, adenosine, lactic acid, etc., when myocardial metabolism increases or crown when arterial blood flow is reduced, the local concentration of one or a group of metabolites is increased, which makes the resistance vascular smooth muscle relax, reduces coronary resistance, and increases coronary blood flow. 4 by the blood vessel wall and platelet-derived bioactive substances: the blood vessel wall can synthesize prostacyclin (pgi2), which has obvious vasodilating effect; while platelets can release txa2 during aggregation, which has a strong vasoconstriction effect. in general, the two substances are in a dynamic balance in the blood flow. if the balance between the two is broken, the changes in vascular tone will be significantly affected. in addition, the endothelium released from the vascular endothelium (endothelium) -derived relaxing factor (edrf) and endothelin (epithelin) also have strong biological activity in the cardiovascular system. endothelium-derived relaxing factor dilates blood vessels, and endothelin is the strongest vasoconstrictor, and the growth and decline of these two substances are also significantly affects the tension of the coronary arteries. when the atherosclerosis of the larger coronary artery leads to occlusion of the lumen, the local blood flow resistance is significantly increased, and the vascular bed of the distal small artery is adjusted to achieve maximum expansion to reduce blood flow resistance and ensure sufficient blood flow. if the coronary vasodilator reserve is near the limit, when the myocardial oxygen consumption increases, the ability to increase blood flow through coronary artery expansion is very limited. repeated regulation by the above various mechanisms can not meet the blood oxygen supply of the heart. myocardial ischemia. 2. the effect of ischemia on the myocardium (1) effects on myocardial metabolism: myocardial energy metabolism is mainly derived from high-energy phosphate compounds (adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine assisted system) produced by glucose and fatty acid oxidative metabolism. the energy required for myocardial activity is almost always high-energy phosphoric acid. the compound is produced by oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria. since the myocardium cannot synthesize lactic acid under normal conditions, the production of triphosphate adenosine by glycolysis is not the main pathway of myocardial productivity. however, when myocardial ischemia and hypoxia, glycolysis becomes a cardiomyocyte. to obtain the main source of adenosine triphosphate, glycolysis can provide a small amount of high-energy phosphate compounds, which can slow down the level of high-energy phosphate compounds in ischemic myocardium, so that the ischemic myocardial injury does not deteriorate rapidly, but the local area of the myocardium increased lactic acid synthesis causes lactic acid accumulation. if the myocardium continues to be hypoxic, it will cause irreversible damage to the myocardium. (2) effects on cardiac function: the direct source of energy required for cardiomyocytes is high-energy phosphate compounds, while the production of high-energy phosphate compounds is mainly based on aerobic metabolism. if myocardial blood supply suddenly stops, atp and phosphate muscles in myocardial tissue the acid level is rapidly reduced, acidosis occurs in the cardiomyocytes, the sensitivity of the contractile protein to calcium ions is reduced, and the accumulation of phosphate and lipids causes myocardial diastolic and systolic dysfunction to occur immediately. first, the diastolic function is affected, which is expressed as -dp/ dt decreased, ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased, compliance decreased; subsequent ventricular systolic function was impaired, +dp+dt progressive abnormality, and finally local myocardial systolic contraction, if the ischemic myocardium involved in a larger range, will reduce the stroke volume, cardiac function indicators such as cardiac output and ventricular ejection fraction, short ischemic time, rapid recovery of blood flow, myocardial contraction and diastolic function can also recover quickly, severe ischemic but shorter, myocardium does not occur permanently sexual damage, at this time under the electron microscope, no damage was observed in the cell membrane, and the high-energy phosphate compound was not lower than 70% of the control level. after the blood flow was restored, the cardiomyocytes were adenylate gradually recovers, but the recovery of myocardial diastolic and systolic function takes a long time. this severe reversible damage to the myocardium is called myocardial stunning. the length of recovery depends on the length of ischemia. depending on the severity, it can last for several minutes, several hours up to several days. severe and long-lasting ischemia leads to irreversible myocardial cell damage, from subendocardial to pericardial dysplasia, and obvious cell membrane damage. in one case, due to the incomplete occlusion of the coronary artery stenosis, the blood flow to the myocardium is lower than normal. in order to reduce the oxygen consumption, the myocardium can reduce the blood flow by reducing the metabolism and reducing the work to achieve the myocardial oxygen supply. a new balance between aerobic conditions. in this state, the myocardium remains viable under low function. if the ischemia does not deteriorate further, the part of the myocardium will neither infarct nor cause clinical symptoms of ischemia. it is called hibernating myocardium. (hibernating myocardium), the state of less blood supply for hibernating myocardium is less self-protective. after waiting for myocardial blood flow is restored, the function of hibernating myocardium can be fully restored, if the balance in such a state of low blood supply is broken, converted to oxygen supply and demand balance in an unfavorable direction, ischemic signs and symptoms occur. (3) effects on electrical activity: myocardial ischemia affects the permeability of myocardial cell membrane to ions, resulting in loss of sodium pump activity, intracellular sodium, and water retention; due to enhanced anaerobic glycolysis in cardiomyocytes, intracellular acidosis occurs; hyperkalemia occurs outside the cell, this change of ischemic myocardium affects the depolarization and repolarization of the ventricle, causing abnormalities in the release and conduction of cardiac impulses, thereby causing severe heart rhythm in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. abnormal. in patients with coronary arterial stenosis and long-term, chronic blood flow reduction, myocardial hibernation and myocardial stunning are common, resulting in long-term inhibition of left ventricular function, if multiple coronary arteries are severe stenosis, when myocardial oxygen consumption increased significantly or severe myocardial ischemia multiple accumulation, can lead to irreversible necrosis of the myocardium, and the myocardium is often mixed with necrotic myocardial tissue, due to extensive or multiple infarction of ischemia myocardium is difficult to maintain a good compensation, so that the number of damaged or necrotic cardiomyocytes is gradually increased. ischemic myocardium is affected by various factors, fibrosis, myocardial interstitial collagen deposition and scar formation after myocardial necrosis, making the wall increased tension and stiffness, wall motion is generally weakened, the heart is significantly enlarged, and even congestive heart failure is caused, developing ischemic cardiomyopathy, but not with ventricular aneurysm.","['myocardial stagnation', 'myocardial infarction', 'chest pain', 'pulmonary embolism', 'cardiac structural abnormality', 'arrhythmia', 'dizziness', 'myocardial dysfunction', 'angina pectoris']",['shock'],"['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
thrombotic superficial phlebitis,"thrombotic superficial phlebitis is a thrombotic inflammation in the visible vein of the human body. the clinical manifestation is along the superficial vein. it is red, swollen, hot, painful, with a cord or hard nodule. the tenderness is obvious. common clinical diseases.thrombosis can cause inflammation, and inflammation can also cause blood clots, which are mutually causal.","proper warmth: everyone knows that in a warm environment, the blood vessels will expand and the skin will become rosy; on the contrary, the skin will appear pale, so in the cold season and in the air-conditioned room, it is appropriate to keep warm, which is true for patients with vasculitis. it is very important that the cold will cause the blood vessels to contract, the blood flow to be reduced, and the symptoms caused by ischemia to become more serious. preventing trauma and timely treatment of wounds not only aggravate vascular injury and paralysis, but also reduce the anti-infective power of the limbs that are already in an ischemic state, causing the wounds to be difficult to heal, even if the mold infections that are usually not taken seriously, such as athlete's foot, etc. the affected limb poses a threat. therefore, avoid foot collisions, crush injuries, and prompt treatment if trauma or foot mold infection occurs. exercise on the affected limb: functional exercise not only prevents muscle atrophy, but also increases the blood flow of the limb, promotes the opening of the vascular branch and maintains the ability of the limb to move. however, the exercise of the affected limb cannot be performed too fast, and the amount of activity should be appropriate because the affected limb itself is in short supply. blood status, excessive activity will inevitably aggravate the symptoms. the activities mentioned here are appropriate, so as not to cause limb pain. reduce blood viscosity: blood flow rate is slow, blood viscosity increases, can cause thrombosis, completely occluded the already narrow artery, can drink more water, usually eat black fungus, and can take small dose under the guidance of a doctor aspirin.","causes of thrombosis of the extremities can be caused by different reasons, clinically can be divided into three categories: superficial phlebitis caused by chemical drugs: intravenous injection of various irritating solutions, such as hypertonic glucose solution, each antibiotics, alkylating agents, organic iodine solutions, etc., can cause chemical stimulation on the intima of the superficial veins, which leads to more extensive damage, rapid thrombosis, and obvious inflammatory reactions. continuous infusion of the catheter: often causes direct damage to the vein wall, thrombosis, and rapid inflammatory response, common in large areas of burns, severe trauma and major surgery and other critically ill patients. varicose veins of the lower extremities: whether it belongs to the saphenous vein or the branch of the small saphenous vein, due to venous blood stasis, the skin of the foot boots often suffers from nutritional changes and is subject to chronic infection, which can cause hypoxemia and inflammation of the varicose veins. damage, leading to thrombotic superficial phlebitis.","['lower leg pigmentation...', 'lower extremity edema', 'local venous tenderness', 'grande silver', 'vascular pulsation or waveform change', 'body cold and hot,...', 'vein varix', 'low heat']",['veve thrombosis'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
tricuspid valvular deformity,"the tricuspid valvular deformity is a rare congenital heart malformation. in 1866, ebstein first reported an example, so it is also known as the ebstein malformation.the incidence rate is 0.5-1% in congenital heart disease. the tricuspid valvular deformity refers to the displacement of the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle, mainly the lowering of the leaflet and the posterior leaflet, often attached to the proximal apex. the right ventricular wall is not the fiber ring of the tricuspid valve. the position of the anterior leaflet is normal. therefore, the right ventricle is divided into two cavities. the ventricular wall above the deformed valve is thin, and the right atrium is connected with a large heart chamber. for the ""atrialized right ventricle"", its function is the same as that of the right atrium; the heart chamber below the malformed valve includes the apex and outflow tract as the ""functional right ventricle"", which plays the same role as the normal right ventricle, but the heart chamber is relatively small. .often accompanied by atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis or atresia.an increase in right atrial pressure may occur, at which point an atrial septal defect or open foramen ovale may result in a right-to-left shunt and a cyanosis.","about 80% of people with severe purpura after birth die at about 10 years of age, while only 5% of those with mild purpura die around 10 years old.after congestive heart failure in patients, most of them die within 2 years, and about 3% of cases are sudden death. common causes of death: congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, hypoxia or pulmonary infection.adult patients often die from repeated embolism, with an average age of 20 years.","the hemodynamic changes in thepathogenesis oftricuspid valvular dysfunction are determined by the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, whether there is atrial septal defect and the size of the defect and the extent of right ventricular function, due to the atrioventricular ring and right ventricle different degrees of tricuspid regurgitation, such as enlargement and leaflet deformation, are common. when the right atrium contracts, the right ventricle relaxes, and the diastolic ventricular part also expands so that the right atrial blood fails to enter the right ventricle, and the right atrium relaxes. ventricular contraction, the right ventricle of the room is also contracted, so the right atrium receives the blood from the vena cava, the atrialized right ventricle and the tricuspid regurgitation, resulting in increased right atrial blood volume, enlargement of the chamber, and elevation of the right atrium. high, finally leading to heart failure, and there are cases of patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. when the right atrial pressure is higher than the left atrium, the right to left shunt is generated. the blood oxygen content of the systemic circulation is decreased, showing purpura and clubbing. ), when the interatrial septum is intact, when the right ventricle contracts, the blood volume is reduced into the lungs, and the arteriovenous oxygen difference becomes smaller, which can produce cheek flushing.mild cyanosis.","['aorta and pulmonary artery shadows are small', 'purple sputum', 'tricuspid stenosis', 'cardiovascular angiography see double-ball levy', 'oval hole incomplete occlusion', 'systolic murmur', 'palp pulmonary artery closure sense, 'weakness', 'pulmonary artery stenosis']",['tricuspid insufficiency'],"['internal medicine', 'cardiology']",['surgical treatment']
tricuspid stenosis,"tricuspidvalveresistance (tricuspidvalveresistance) is a type of heart valve disease in which blood flow is blocked by various causes of tricuspid stenosis, limited opening of the valve leaflets, and reduced open area.the most common cause of acquired tricuspid stenosis is rheumatism, accounting for more than 90% of all cases.the pathological changes are fibrotic thickening of the tricuspid valve leaf, and even curling, the valve leaf activity is limited, the junction is fused, the valve area is reduced, the chordae tendine is thickened and shortened, so the valve stenosis and the insufficiency often coexist.","the disease is mainly caused by rheumatic fever, so patients with rheumatic fever should be actively treated clinically. considering the possibility of tricuspid stenosis, early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment should be achieved. the measures include: 1. effective primary and secondary prevention (1) effective primary prevention: refers to the prevention of the first episode of rheumatic fever, the key is early diagnosis and treatment of methyl chain tonsillitis, the preferred drug is penicillin, huang zhendong scholars to carry out the group sexual rheumatic fever level and prevention research, early detection of methyl-chain tonsil pharyngitis and early drug intervention, the results show that the intervention of half a year can reduce the number of cases of methyl-chain tonsillitis in the population by as much as 95.4% to 100%, reaching group rheumatism thermal primary prevention effect. (2) active secondary prevention: refers to prevention of recurrence of rheumatic fever, which is essential for patients who have suffered from heart-warming or existing rheumatism. rheumatic fever recurrence is most common in the first 5 years after the first episode, and recurrence after 5 years. only 5%, the prevention target mainly refers to patients with rheumatic fever with a clear history of rheumatic fever and/or diagnosis. for patients with initial rheumatic fever without carditis, prevent 5 years after the last episode of rheumatic fever, at least to 18 to 20 years old; if there is carditis, it should be extended or even life. for patients with chronic rheumatic valvular disease, the prevention time should be long, usually until 50 years old or even for life; even pbmv (percutaneous mitral balloon) surgery is still necessary to prevent rheumatism after surgery. 2. key points of preventive measures (1) prevention of rheumatic fever: it is the key. individual use should be used when using drugs. injection of penicillin should be especially alert to the occurrence of anaphylactic shock. when the clinic is injected, there should be corresponding first aid facilities. (2) avoid crowding: especially in the family bedroom and school classroom, keep well ventilated, not suitable for crowded places, because of the rapid spread of streptococcus between people, may increase the chance of infection. (3) reasonable arrangement of life and work: pay attention to work and rest, avoid mental and physical overwork and bad stimulation, emotional agitation, lack of sleep, etc., quit smoking and alcohol, avoid overeating and overweight, heart dysfunction should avoid severe exercise and sudden exertion, such as running, swimming, lifting weights, driving, etc., heart function level i can basically live a normal life, but should not participate in competitive physical activity; heart function ≡ level ii should avoid medium and heavy physical labor, such as there is no time to rest and treatment, female patients with heart function i ~ ii can consider pregnancy, but need to be closely observed during pregnancy, heart function level iii or above should not be pregnant. (4) regular examination: the main target is the cardiac function compensator, and patients with grade ii or above should actively undergo interventional and surgical treatment. (5) master the self-care ability of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease: patients with rheumatic heart disease should learn some simple prevention knowledge and skills, such as measuring body temperature, counting pulse, listening to heart rate, measuring blood pressure, measuring urine volume, weighing body, low-salt diet. etc. and familiar with major clinical manifestations such as rheumatic activity, heart failure, arterial embolism and infective endocarditis. (6) prevention of complications and comorbidities: the focus is on prevention of heart failure, low-salt diet in patients with rheumatic heart disease, avoiding excessive exertion, work fatigue, secondary infection, arrhythmia are important, for aortic valve disease or prosthetic valve replacement patients, if necessary, often use antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis.","(1) causes of the disease rheumatic heart disease, congenital tricuspid stenosis, right atrial tumor, carcinoid heart disease, endocardial myocardial fibrosis, valve leaf mites, extracardiac tumor.

tricuspid atresia,"tricuspid atresia is a cyanotic congenital heart disease with an incidence of 1% to 5% of congenital heart disease.in the cyanotic congenital heart disease relaying tetralogy of fallot and the transposition of the great arteries ranked third.it is defined as the absence of tricuspid and tricuspid valves, and there is no direct communication between the right atrium and the right ventricle.the main pathological changes were tricuspid atresia or tricuspid valve loss, patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect, left ventricular enlargement, and right ventricular dysplasia.the embryos underwent fusion of the endocardial pad under normal development conditions, dividing the atrioventricular tube into two left and right orifices, and participating in the formation of the membrane ventricular septum and the closed atrial septum.it is generally believed that the fusion site of the endocardial pad before and after the embryonic period is biased to the right side, and the right ventricular septum is displaced to cause uneven separation of the atrioventricular septum. the occlusion of the right atrioventricular canal is followed by tricuspid occlusion.the malformation is essentially a special type of left ventricular ventricle double entrance, with only the left mitral valve bordering between the left atrium and the left ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral valve enlargement, and right ventricular dysplasia.the vast majority of cases were atrial orthostatic and ventricular sac, with atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale and ventricular septal defect.only a few cases were atrial reversal and ventricular left axillary.the relationship between the ventricle and the aorta can be consistent or inconsistent, and the pulmonary artery can be narrow, locked, or normal.","tricuspid atresia is a complex cyanotic congenital cardiovascular malformation with very poor prognosis and short survival. 49.5% die within 6 months after birth, 66% die within 1 year, and a few can survive to 10 years old. above, the type of lesion and the degree of hemodynamic abnormality are factors that determine prognosis. the symptoms of cyanosis are severe at birth, and the shunt is less in the atrial septum or interventricular septum. 90% of the patients die within 1 year of age; the prognosis of pulmonary blood flow increases better, but some patients died of heart failure at an early stage. more than 50% of patients who have undergone appropriate surgery can survive to 15 years of age. in a follow-up report of a group of fontan surgery, the 5-year survival rate is 85. %, the 10-year survival rate is 78%, and the main causes of death are heart failure, arrhythmia, infection and reoperation. currently, there is no effective preventive measure. the main clinical diagnosis is to distinguish it from other cyanotic congenital heart disease. in order to properly treat the child in time. 1. primary prevention of congenital heart disease is caused by environmental factors, genetic factors and the interaction between the two. the prevention of genetic factors mainly focuses on premarital examination, avoiding close relatives' marriage, accepting genetic counseling, and more importantly, trying to it is found that the prevention and prevention of environmental factors such as viral infections, drugs, alcohol and maternal diseases that may cause adverse changes in genetic predisposition during pregnancy to break the interaction between environmental factors and genetic factors is the key to primary prevention. 2. secondary prevention (1) early diagnosis: early diagnosis of congenital heart disease can be divided into two steps. 1 fetal diagnosis: in the 16 to 20 weeks of pregnancy, amniotic fluid cell culture, chromosome analysis, genetic diagnosis and enzyme activity determination, amniotic fluid metabolites, special protein and enzyme activity, etc. the above examinations were performed by women's vaginal aspiration of villus at 8 to 12 weeks of gestation, which is of great value for congenital heart disease caused by single gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations. 2 infancy diagnosis: a comprehensive physical examination should be performed on the babies born, especially the cardiovascular system should be carefully auscultated and found to be further examined by cardiac ultrasound. (2) early treatment: once the fetal diagnosis of congenital cardiovascular malformation is confirmed in the fetal period, the pregnancy should be terminated in time. for some hereditary enzymes or metabolic deficiency diseases, relevant replacement therapy should be carried out early after birth, and the conditional hospital gene therapy can be performed to prevent the occurrence of the corresponding disease. 3. third-level prevention of congenital heart disease once the diagnosis is confirmed, the fundamental method of treatment is to perform surgical operations to completely correct the cardiac vascular malformation, thereby eliminating the pathophysiological changes caused by the deformity, and those who are not operated or temporarily unable to operate should be based on avoid overwork, so as not to cause heart failure, if heart failure occurs, anti-heart failure treatment, prevention and treatment of complications, all patients with congenital heart disease undergo invasive examination or treatment, including cardiac catheterization, extraction, tonsillectomy, etc. antibiotics are routinely used to prevent infective endocarditis.","(1) the cause of the disease is generally considered to be that the embryo is under normal development, the endocardial cushion is fused, and the atrioventricular tube is equally divided into two left and right orifices and participates in the formation of the membrane ventricular septum and the closed atrial septum, the first orifice, the tricuspid valve differentiated from the endocardial pad and the right ventricular myocardium, during this process, the tricuspid dysplasia, degeneration of the valve leaflets, degeneration, lack of valve leaf tissue, the valve hole is surrounded by fibrous tissue, closed, and finally led to tricuspid atresia, (it is generally considered that the fusion site of the endocardial pad is biased to the right side before and after the embryonic period, and the right ventricular septum is displaced to cause uneven separation of the atrioventricular septum. the occlusion of the right atrioventricular canal is followed by tricuspid atresia.) (ii) pathogenesis 1. pathological changes of about 90% of cases of tricuspid atresia, tricuspid valve fusion into a decidual membrane, pulmonary dysplasia, occlusion can also involve the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary trunk, and severe pulmonary dysplasia the right ventricle can be severely stunted to normal size, or even dilated, and the tricuspid valve has varying degrees of insufficiency. in the autopsy of the tricuspid atresia, the left ventricle is often enlarged and hypertrophied, but the mitral valve is normal or enlarged. there have also been reports of mitral valve multi-valvular deformity, mitral valve mitral and mitral valve riding across development incomplete right ventricle. tricuspid atresia usually includes the following malformations: 1 tricuspid atresia, no right atrial right ventricular traffic; 2 atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale; 3 ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus. tricuspid atresia is congenital closure, there is no valve hole, only a small depression in the bottom of the right atrium, surrounded by muscle fibers, a few fibrous or membranous structures, 80% of the traffic in the heart chamber is a foramen ovale unclosed, may also be atrial septal defect, or even a single atrium. there are five types of right atrium and right ventricle connected to the tricuspid atresia: 1 muscle type accounts for 76% to 84%, muscle is at the bottom of the right atrium, and there is a small dimple near the side wall, directly across the left. the ventricle is not connected to the right ventricle; 2 the diaphragm type accounts for about 8% to 12%, and a closed diaphragm between the right atrium and the right ventricle; 3 valve type accounts for about 6%, there is an open valve at the junction of the right atrium and the right ventricle, but there are diaphragms and muscles underneath that completely separate the right atrium from the right ventricle, forming a occlusion; 4ebstein malformation accounts for about 6%, right the atresia of the tricuspid valve formed between the atria and the right ventricle; 5 endocardial pad defect type accounted for about 2%, the common atrioventricular valve atresia from the right atrium to the right ventricle. edward and burchell first classified the tricuspid atresia into three types according to the relationship between the aorta, and then further classified into type ia, type ib, type ic, type iia, type iib, type iic, depending on the presence or absence of pulmonary atresia or stenosis. there are 8 types of type iiia and iiib. among the cases of tricuspid atresia, type ib, type ic, type iib, type iic, and type iiia are the most common. type i tricuspid atresia (69%): this type is characterized by normal vascular relationship, type ia, pulmonary atresia; type ib, pulmonary stenosis with small ventricular septal defect; type ic, pulmonary stenosis with large ventricular septal defect. type ii tricuspid atresia (27%): this type is characterized by complete type of large vessel translocation, type iia, pulmonary atresia; type iib, pulmonary stenosis with small ventricular septal defect; type iic, normal pulmonary artery with large ventricular septal defect . type iii tricuspid atresia (4%): type iii is characterized by corrective large vessel transposition, type iiia, pulmonary stenosis; type iiib, subaortic stenosis, with pulmonary atresia (ie ia, iia) type), died in infancy, with pulmonary stenosis (ib, iib, iiia), accounting for 70% of childhood cases, 100% of adult cases. tricuspid atresia may combine multiple heart and large vessel malformations. the traffic in the heart chamber always exists. the patent foramen ovale accounts for 80%, the rest is atrial septal defect, and 22% of patients have a left superior vena cava. usually drained to the coronary sinus, occasionally drained directly to the left atrium, venous venous drainage and coronary artery malformation are less common, patients with congenital pulmonary artery dysplasia often with membranous tricuspid atresia, 20% tricuspid atresia patients combined parallel auricles, may also be associated with aortic coarctation, dysplasia or atresia, aortic arch disconnection, aortic valve atresia. 2. pathophysiology tricuspid atresia patients, systemic venous return blood can not directly into the right ventricular cavity, the right atrium blood can only reach the left atrium through the heart room traffic, the left atrium becomes the body, the pulmonary venous blood mixed heart chamber, the mixed blood enters the left ventricle through a relatively normal mitral valve orifice, and then exits the left ventricle through the normally connected aortic valve orifice and aorta. therefore, all patients have varying degrees of arterial oxygen saturation reduction. the degree of reduction depends on the severity of pulmonary blood flow obstruction. if the blood flow in the lungs is normal or increased, and the blood flow to the pulmonary veins is normal or increased, the arterial oxygen saturation is only slightly lower than normal, and there is no clinical or mild cyanosis. if the blood flow in the lungs is reduced and the blood flow to the pulmonary veins is reduced, the arterial oxygen saturation is significantly reduced, 70% of hypoxemia occurs, and there are obvious cyanosis in the clinic, such as atrial septal defect, right-to-left shunt limitation, severe venous hypertension and right heart failure occur. due to dysplasia of the right ventricle, the left ventricle alone bears the body, the pumping work of the pulmonary circulation, the left ventricle needs extra work to promote the blood flow of a large number of pulmonary circulation, and the continuous overload operation can lead to left heart hypertrophy, left heart failure, and pulmonary blood flow. in the reduced cases, the left ventricle only increases the volume load, and often does not produce heart failure. however, in cases of increased pulmonary blood flow, the left ventricle often increases due to chronic volume load, left ventricular end-diastolic volume increases, and myocardial contractile function decreases. left ventricular enlargement, heart failure, if there is aortic coarctation or aortic disconnection, promote the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. the development of the right ventricle of the heart varies with the size of the ventricular septal defect and the degree of pulmonary stenosis. generally, there are pulmonary stenosis and small ventricular septal defect. a small part of the blood enters the dysplastic right ventricle from the left ventricle through the ventricular septal defect, and then passes through the stenosis. pulmonary artery into the lungs, reducing pulmonary blood flow, a small number of patients with only mild or no pulmonary stenosis, accompanied by large ventricular septal defect, more blood from the left ventricle into the well-developed right ventricle and pulmonary artery, so that the lungs increased blood flow, a rare case is no ventricular septal defect, pulmonary valve atresia, the only passage of blood to the lungs is the patent ductus or bronchial artery.","['be out of breath', 'cyanosis', 'newborn cyanosis', 'jugular vein anger', 'phenomenon', 'hair lividity', 'newborn hair lividity', 'pulmonary blood flow a lot']",['arrhythmia'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']",['surgical treatment']
three room heart,"sanfangxin is a congenital cardiovascular malformation that is divided into two parts by the fibrosis of the left or right atrium due to embryonic developmental disorders.it is a rare congenital heart disease, accounting for about 0.1% of congenital heart disease. the three-room heart can be divided into left-type and right-type. the left atrium is divided into left-shaped three-atrial heart, and the right atrium is divided. it is called the right-type three-room heart.the right-type three-room heart is very rare, accounting for only about % of the left-type three-room heart.usually referred to as the three-bedroom heart refers to the left-type three-room heart, referred to as the three-room heart, which means that the left atrium is divided into the atrium and the true left atrium (connected to the left atrial appendage, and through the mitral and left ventricular traffic).there are many types of three-room heart classification. according to the basic anatomical changes and clinical practice, the three-room heart can be divided into partial and complete types.according to whether the fiber muscle membrane is intact and whether it is combined with asd, it can be divided into type i and type ii in partial type, and type i, type ii and type iii in complete type.the time of symptom onset is mainly related to the size of the traffic hole between the auxiliary room and the real room. for example, the traffic hole is very small, especially the full-type three-room heart. the child may have cyanosis or crying after a few weeks of birth. difficulty breathing, growth retardation, and even severe pneumonia and congestive heart failure.","there is no effective preventive measure for this disease, but the surgical effect is good. the pulmonary arterial pressure may drop to normal after surgery. for infants with congestive heart failure, the mortality rate is high. therefore, early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment are still treated. a key to this disease.","the cause of this disease is not very clear. it is generally believed that the common venous trunk in the embryonic period failed to fuse with the left atrium, and the enlargement of the common pulmonary veins constitutes part of the left atrium, and the original left atrium is not integrated into the sub-atrium, and the original abnormal development of the septum, abnormal diaphragm in the left atrium, the left atrium is divided into the auxiliary room and the real left atrium. pathogenesis hemodynamic changes depend on the size and concomitant malformation of the diaphragmatic orifice in the atria.the hemodynamics of the left three-chamber heart is similar to the mitral stenosis. the left septum is only a few millimeters in diameter, which can cause pulmonary venous return stasis, pulmonary stagnation, pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension, and partial pulmonary vein abnormal reflux or a septal defect between the right atrium and the secondary atrium creates a left-to-right shunt. if the atrial septal defect is close to the intrinsic atrial lumen, it is a right-to-left shunt.","['systolic murmur', 'diaphragm hole narrow']",['pulmonary hypertension'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
carotid body tumor,"carotid body tumor is a rare chemoreceptor tumor, also known as paraganglioma.most of the carotid body is located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. it has an envelope, an indefinite size, about 3.5 mm in diameter, rich in blood vessels and nerves. the blood supply is supplied by a small branch of the common carotid artery. the nerve comes from the cervical sympathetic ganglia, the glossopharyngeal nerve, and the vagus nerve. and the hypoglossal nerve.carotid body tumors were observed by the naked eye as reddish-brown, round or oval, with lobes and outer envelope.the cells are mainly polygonal, stained with cytoplasmic eosin, containing many vacuoles and microsomes.occurs in 30 to 40 years old, the malignant variability is 5% to 10%.","there is no effective prevention method, early detection and early treatment.","it is a chemosensory tissue tumor located in the outer membrane layer of the artery behind the bifurcation of the common carotid artery.the tumor is derived from the non-chromophobic paraganglioma of the accessory ganglion tissue, so it is also called carotid body paraneoplastic tumor.chronic hypoxia is associated with a high incidence in the highlands.long-term chronic hypoxic stimulation causes compensatory hyperplasia of the carotid body, eventually forming a carotid body tumor.most family history patients have bilateral onset.","['trembling', 'progressive neck mass', 'syncope', 'sound hoarseness', 'breathing difficulty', 'neck beat', 'systolic murmur', 'difficulty swallowing', 'dizziness', 'neck thick section]",['lymphoma'],"['oncology', 'tumor surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment']"
complete anomalous pulmonary venous return,"total anomalous pulmonary venous return refers to the venous system in which the entire pulmonary vein does not enter the left atrium, and the four pulmonary veins respectively or merge into one, and enter the right atrium through the vertical meridians or enter the systemic circulation through the vertical vein.it can be drained to the left innominate vein, superior vena cava, right atrium, left superior vena cava, coronary sinus, azygous vein or portal vein, but not into the left atrium, resulting in an increase in the right atrium and right ventricle.it often coincides with atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.the oxygenated and unoxygenated blood mixed in the right atrium is allowed to flow into the left atrium, thereby supplying the systemic arterial blood.the incidence rate accounts for 1.5 to 2% of congenital heart disease.according to the ectopic connection and the location of the heart: can be divided into intracardiac complete pulmonary venous drainage; supraventricular complete pulmonary venous drainage; subcardiac complete pulmonary venous drainage and mixed complete pulmonary vein ectopic drainage.according to the obstruction of pulmonary venous return, it is divided into obstructive and non-obstructive type.","90% of patients with complete pulmonary venous return died within 1 year after birth. the diagnosis of pulmonary venous obstruction should be performed immediately after the diagnosis of pulmonary venous obstruction. the patients with pulmonary vein obstruction should be treated with internal medicine and expand the atrial septum with cystic catheter to make the congestive if heart failure is controlled, the radical surgery can be suspended for a short time.","the origin of the lung is derived from the foregut. the pulmonary vascular plexus is derived from the visceral venous plexus and flows into the main vein, the umbilical vein and the yolk vein. when the atrium is not separated, the common pulmonary vein protrudes from the middle of the posterior wall of the atrium into two branches, each of which c1 is divided into two, respectively, into the left and right lungs, the venous post-expanded common pulmonary vein is absorbed into the enlarged left atrium, so the four pulmonary veins are all open in the left atrium, and are separated from the systemic veins, and the lungs appear. the junction of the common vein and the left atrium is not developed, but is connected to the main vein, umbilical vein or yolk vein, causing various types of pulmonary malformation connections, the most common being the inflow into the innominate vein or the coronary sinus. pathological darling divides the complete pulmonary venous venous flow into four types according to the connection point of pulmonary venous malformation: 1 55% of the supraventricular type, the pulmonary veins converge behind the left atrium and then drain through the vertical vein to the left innominate vein, sometimes into the superior vena cava or the azygous vein and the vertical vein enter the innominate vein in front of the left pulmonary artery and the left common bronchus. the compression here can cause venous return obstruction; 2 the intracardiac type accounts for 30%, and all the pulmonary veins are directly introduced into the right atrium or drained through the pulmonary vein to the main trunk. coronary sinus, obstruction may occur between the total trunk of the pulmonary vein and the coronary sinus; 3 subcardiac type accounts for 12%, all pulmonary veins meet at the back of the heart and then enter the portal vein through the diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus through the vertical vein, the inferior vena cava or venous catheter etc., reflux blood through the high-resistance hepatic vascular bed to the right atrium or vertical vein under the pressure on the way, can cause pulmonary vein obstruction; 4 mixed type about 3%, all pulmonary veins through multiple channels into the right atrium, subcardiac type and mixed most of the patients died in infants and young children, about 75% of patients with complete pulmonary venous return have patent foramen ovale, 25% there is atrial septal defect, right atrium, right ventricle often enlarges hypertrophy, pulmonary artery enlarges, pressure increases, left atrium is small, pulmonary vein obstruction is most common in subcardiac type, followed by supraventricular type, the incidence can be as high as 50%, other coexist cardiac vascular malformations include patent ductus arteriosus, aortic coarctation, permanent arterial trunk, aortic dislocation, single ventricle, pulmonary atresia, tetralogy of fallot and double outlet of right ventricle. pathophysiology in patients with complete anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, all pulmonary vein blood enters the right atrium, and the blood in the right atrium needs to flow into the left atrium through the patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. otherwise, it is very dead after birth, and the right atrium receives the pulmonary circulation. all of the blood flow to the heart, the blood flow is extremely increased, and the patient with the patent foramen ovale has a small passage between the atrium and the blood from the vena cava and the pulmonary vein is mixed into the left atrium and then into the left atrium. systemic circulation, so mild purpura appears in the clinic, but the blood flow in the right heart chamber and pulmonary circulation is large, and the pulmonary artery pressure is increased. most of them die from right heart failure within a few months after birth. the atrial septal defect is large, and the left atrium enters the left. atrial blood flow, cyanosis is obvious, and pulmonary hypertension is delayed, most patients can survive for more than 1 year, pulmonary venous reflux obstruction, the degree of purpura, pulmonary vascular stagnation, pulmonary edema, mostly after birth","['uplifting pulsation', 'right heart failure', 'purple sputum', 'systolic murmur', 'cardiac malformation', 'skull finger (toe)', 'slow growth', 'intravenous continuous blood flow' ]",['malnutrition'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
complete aortic dislocation,"the meaning of complete aortic dislocation is the abnormal origin of the aorta and pulmonary artery. the aorta is from the anatomical right ventricle, receiving the systemic venous blood from the dissecting right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery is from the anatomy of the left ventricle, receiving the pulmonary vein from the left ventricle. oxygenated blood, thus forming two isolated circulatory systems, namely right atrium L right ventricle L aorta L whole body L body vein L right atrium, a cycle; left atrium L left ventricle L pulmonary artery L lung L pulmonary vein L left atrium, for another circulatory system.the position of the ventricle is normal and the aortic opening is located on the right side of the pulmonary artery. it is called right axillary aortic dislocation (d-tga). d-tga is a common type of complex congenital heart disease in clinical practice. transposition of the aorta of the ventricular septal defect.complete transposition of the great arteries may be associated with atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary stenosis.","complete aortic dislocation without ventricular septal defect, poor prognosis, about 80 to 90% of cases died within 1 year of age, about 45% died within 1 month without surgery, 69% died within 3 months, 75% within 8 months of death, 80% died within 1 year of age. in recent years, due to the development of infant heart surgery in china, the department of cardiology of pediatrics attaches great importance to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic dislocation, which has increased the survival rate of infants after birth. cardiac surgery has created conditions for radical surgery. common causes of death without surgery are heart failure and pulmonary infection, hypoxia, cerebral hemorrhage, and erythrocytosis, which cause cerebral embolism. common causes after surgery are heart failure, low-discharge synthesis. signs, respiratory failure and complete atrioventricular block.","complete aortic dislocation (tga) is due to the fifth to seventh week of embryonic development, mediastinal torsion or non-helical torsion, resulting in the transposition of the main and pulmonary arteries, so the body and lung circulation become independent cycles, that is, the veins of the body veins. the blood flows back into the right atrium, the right ventricle, and reaches the tissues and organs of the whole body through the aorta. the arterial blood of the pulmonary veins flows back into the left atrium, and the left ventricle passes through the pulmonary artery and reaches the lungs. therefore, the child is difficult to survive, such as other cardiac malformations. the shunt channel between the two cycles can exchange a small amount of mixed blood to temporarily maintain life, and the flow rates on both sides are different. repeatedly, it can cause pulmonary hypertension, obstruction, ventricular dilatation, hypertrophy, heart failure and death.","['heart failure', 'purple', 'vascular malformation', 'breathing difficulty', 'systolic murmur', 'ventricular septal defect', 'heart enlargement', 'air rush']","['cerebral hemorrhage', 'cerebral embolism', 'heart failure', 'respiratory failure', 'atrioventricular block'","['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
shock,"shock is a clinical syndrome caused by insufficient acute tissue perfusion. it is a common complication in clinical serious diseases.although the etiology is different, the common feature of shock is that the effective circulation is insufficient, resulting in low perfusion state of the tissue, resulting in poor blood perfusion of the whole body tissues and organs, resulting in tissue hypoxia, microcirculation stasis, organ dysfunction and cellular a series of pathophysiological changes such as metabolic dysfunction.therefore, the onset of shock generally develops from reduced compensatory tissue perfusion to microcirculatory failure, which ultimately leads to cell death.therefore, it is clinically divided into early shock and compensatory period. the middle stage is also called stasis period. the late stage is called refractory period. the main clinical manifestations are blood pressure drop, pale complexion, wet limbs and limbs purpura, superficial vein collapse, pulse. thin, general weakness, reduced urine output, irritability, unresponsiveness, confusion, and even coma.","1. comprehensive prevention measures should be taken for the prevention of shock. for the wounded and sick people who may have shock, the corresponding preventive measures should be taken for the cause, and the wounded and sick should be promptly and accurately treated. the active bleeding should stop the bleeding. the fracture site should be securely fixed; the soft tissue injury should be bandaged to prevent contamination; the airway obstruction should be tracheotomy; if it needs to be delivered, it should be sent before and after the shock, and the fast and comfortable transportation means should be used. to the rear of the car or the tail of the aircraft, to prevent mid-brain anemia, continue to infusion during the delivery, and prepare for first aid. 2, severely infected patients, using sensitive antibiotics, intravenous drip, and actively remove the primary lesions (such as drainage and drainage), for some surgical diseases that may be complicated by shock, grasp the preoperative preparation, surgery within 2 hours, such as necrosis intestinal section resection. 3, must fully prepare the surgical patients before surgery, including correction of water and electrolyte disorders and hypoproteinemia; fill blood volume; comprehensive understanding of visceral function; choose appropriate anesthesia methods, but also fully estimate the possible shock during surgery various factors, take appropriate measures to prevent hypovolemic shock. 4. in summary, it can be summarized as actively eliminating the cause and improving the body's ability to adjust and compensate.","there are many reasons for shock. there are also many methods for classification. from the clinical point of view, shock can be divided into the following factors: cardiogenic shock narrowly refers to the serious stage of acute myocardial infarction pump failure ( see acute myocardial infarction), acute myocardial infarction, clinically accompanied by blood pressure reduction, skin hypoperfusion, renal blood flow reduction, central nervous system dysfunction and other important organs microcirculation failure, but can exclude drugs (such as town pain, vasodilator, diuretic), low blood pressure caused by loss of body fluid or lack of fluid replacement, can consider the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock. cardiac shock in a broad sense also includes acute myocarditis, massive pulmonary infarction, papillary muscle or chordae rupture, leaflet perforation, severe aortic valve or pulmonary stenosis with mild or moderate tachycardia, acute pericardial tamponade, tension sexual pneumothorax, atrial myxoma, severe mitral or tricuspid stenosis with mild or moderate tachycardia, sustained tachycardia and other shocks. hypovolemic shock is a large amount of blood loss (internal or external bleeding) in the body or blood vessels, loss of water (such as vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal fistula, diabetic acidosis, etc.), loss of plasma (such as extensive burns, shock caused by sudden decrease in blood volume due to peritonitis, trauma and inflammation, etc., characterized by decreased venous pressure, increased peripheral vascular resistance and tachycardia, hemorrhagic shock, traumatic shock and burn shock are all hypovolemic sexual shock (see ""upper gastrointestinal bleeding""). septic shock, also known as toxic shock, is characterized by insufficient perfusion of tissue, usually caused by gram-negative bacilli infection, and its circulatory insufficiency is due to increased peripheral vascular resistance, stasis of blood flow in the microcirculation, and cardiac output. reduced and tissue hypoxia (a few are reduced vascular resistance, small movements, open venous short circuit, cardiac output does not decrease or even increase, but microcirculation perfusion is reduced), the cause is mainly seen in gram-negative bacilli infection (such as sepsis, peritonitis, necrotizing cholangitis, etc.), toxic bacillary dysentery, toxic pneumonia, fulminant epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, etc.; shock is not caused by direct invasion of bacteria into the bloodstream, but with bacteria endotoxin and its cell wall lipopolysaccharide are released into the blood, especially in patients with frail, aging, malnutrition, diabetes, malignant tumors and long-term use of hormones, immunosuppressive drugs and antimetabolites. ""infectious shock""). anaphylactic shock is a rare type of shock in which the body develops an allergic reaction to certain biological products, drugs or animal and plant allergens. allergens and antibodies act on sensitized cells, the latter releasing excessive serotonin, histamine, bradykinin and other substances cause peripheral blood vessels to dilate, capillary bed enlargement, plasma exudation, relatively insufficient blood volume, plus often throat laryngeal, bronchospasm caused by dyspnea, so that the chest cavity the internal pressure is increased, so that the amount of blood returning to the heart is reduced, and the amount of blood discharged from the heart is also reduced (see ""allergic shock""). neurogenic shock is a serious disorder of arterial resistance regulation, loss of vascular tone, causing vasodilation, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular resistance, shock caused by reduced circulating blood volume, and shock caused by neurological factors alone, which can be seen in trauma, drama pain, cerebrospinal injury, drug anesthesia, intravenous barbiturates, ganglion blockers or other antihypertensive drugs, and trauma. others have endocrine insufficiency (adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, etc.) and endocrine hyperactivity (such as thyroid crisis, hyperparathyroidism, carcinoid and primary aldosteronism, etc.) shock. clinically, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock, and anaphylactic shock are more common.","['weak', 'shock', 'respiratory failure', 'indifferent expression', 'no urine', 'slow response', 'hair sputum', 'skull and nail bed slightly blueish', 'hypotension']","['heart failure', 'acute renal failure']",['emergency department'],"['timely supplementation of blood volume, active treatment of primary disease, drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy,"hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy of newborn (hie) refers to cerebral hypoxic ischemic damage caused by perinatal hypoxic asphyxia, including characteristic neuropathology and neuropathophysiological processes, and clinically there are a series of manifestations of encephalopathy, and some children may have different degrees of neurological sequelae.","the prevention of this disease is more important than prevention of the onset of perinatal asphyxia. it is necessary to continuously improve obstetric techniques, promptly handle intrauterine distress, and end the delivery as soon as possible. infants with asphyxia after birth should be resuscitated in time to reduce the occurrence of hie. pregnant women should regularly perform prenatal examinations and find that high-risk pregnancies should be treated promptly to avoid premature delivery and surgical delivery; improve obstetric techniques; provide fetal heart rate monitoring for high-risk pregnancies, and early detection of intrauterine distress and treatment; immediately after the head is delivered, the mucus in the nose and mouth is squeezed out, and after the birth, the mucus is again squeezed out or sucked out, the secretion of the nasopharynx is prepared, and all preparations for neonatal resuscitation are prepared. once the fetal distress is found, the mother is immediately given oxygen, and the newborn is resuscitated and oxygenated. the newborn should be supine after birth, with a slightly higher head and less disturbance. (1) during the delivery process, the fetal heart rate should be closely monitored, and the fetal scalp blood ph and blood gas should be measured regularly. it is necessary to promptly give oxygen and intravenous glucose and other drugs in the intrauterine distress, and choose the best way to end the delivery as soon as possible. (2) newborns who suffocate after birth should strive to establish effective breathing and perfect circulation function within 5 minutes to minimize the damage of brain cells after hypoxia. (3) newborns after asphyxia resuscitation should closely observe neurological symptoms and monitor vital signs. once abnormal neurological symptoms such as disturbance of consciousness, weakened limbs, and primitive reflexes are not easily elicited, the diagnosis of this disease should be considered. treatment is given to reduce the incidence of sequelae in survivors.","(1) there are many factors causing neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage: 1. hypoxia (1) perinatal asphyxia: including prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum asphyxia, intrauterine hypoxia, abnormal placenta function, umbilical cord prolapse, compression and around the neck; abnormal delivery such as urgency, stagnation, abnormal fetal position; abnormal fetal development such as premature delivery, expired production and intrauterine growth retardation. (2) apnea: repeated apnea can lead to hypoxic ischemic brain damage. (3) severe pulmonary infection: newborns have serious respiratory diseases, such as severe lung infections. 2. ischemia (1) severe circulatory diseases: sudden cardiac arrest and bradycardia, severe congenital heart disease, severe heart failure, etc. (2) a large number of blood loss: a large amount of blood loss or shock. (3) severe intracranial diseases: such as intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral edema. neonatal asphyxia is the leading cause of this disease in hie, with prenatal and postpartum asphyxia accounting for 50% and 40%, respectively, and other causes account for about 10%. (b) the pathogenesis 1. hemodynamic changes in the absence of oxygen when the body occurs diving reflection, in order to ensure the blood supply of important vital organs (such as brain, heart), cerebral vasodilation, non-significant organ vasoconstriction, this automatic adjustment function the brain is not damaged in mild short-term hypoxia, such as hypoxia persists, degeneration of cerebrovascular autonomic regulation, and the ability of cerebral arteries to respond to changes in perfusion pressure and co2 concentration is weakened, resulting in pressure-dependent passiveness. during cerebral blood flow regulation, cerebral blood flow is reduced when blood pressure is lowered, causing ischemic damage to the edge of the artery. 2. brain cell energy metabolism failure intracellular oxidative metabolism disorder in hypoxia, can only rely on glucose anaerobic glycolysis to generate energy, while producing a large amount of lactic acid and accumulating in cells, leading to intracellular acidosis and brain edema, due to anaerobic leaven the energy produced by the solution is far less than that of aerobic metabolism, and must be compensated by increasing glycogenolysis and glucose uptake, thereby causing secondary energy failure, resulting in impaired ion pump function on the cell membrane, intracellular sodium, calcium and water. increased, causing cells to swell and dissolve. 3. reperfusion injury and oxygen free radicals oxygen free radicals increase and decrease during hypoxia-ischemia, a large number of oxygen free radicals accumulate in the body, damage cell membranes, proteins and nucleic acids, resulting in destruction of cell structure and function, oxygen hydroxyl radicals are the most harmful to free radicals in the free radicals. xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase are mainly concentrated in the endothelial cells of microvessels, resulting in damage to the vascular endothelium, destruction of the structure and integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and formation of vascular sources. sexual brain edema. 4. when the ca2 internal flow is hypoxia, the activity of the calcium pump is weakened, which leads to calcium influx. when the intracellular ca2 concentration is too high, the enzyme regulated by ca2 is activated, and the phospholipase is activated, which can decompose the membrane phospholipid and produce a large amount of arachidene. acid, under the action of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, forms prostacyclin, thromboxane and leukotriene, nuclease activation, can cause nucleic acid decomposition and destruction, protease activation, can catalyze the transformation of xanthine dehydrogenase into jaundice oxidase, which catalyzes the hypoxanthine to become jaundice when restoring oxygen supply and blood flow, while generating free radicals, further aggravating nerve cell damage. 5. neurotoxicity of excitatory amino acids energy failure can cause damage to the sodium pump function, extracellular k accumulation, continuous depolarization of the cell membrane, presynaptic neurons release a large amount of excitatory amino acids (glutamate), accompanied by sudden impaired post-touch glutamate damage, resulting in increased glutamate in the synaptic cleft, over-activation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, non-n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors when activated, na influx, cl- and h2o also passively enter the cell, causing rapid death of neurons; when nmda receptor is activated, ca2 influx can lead to a series of biochemical chain reactions, causing delayed neuronal death . 6. biphasic action of nitric oxide (no) no is also a gas radical that reacts with o2 to produce a peroxynitrite (onoo-) and further decomposes into oh- and no2-, when in the presence of metallic iron, onoo- decomposes to generate free radicals no2-, oh- and no2- have a strong cytotoxic effect. in addition, no can also mediate the toxic effects of glutamate, and can also damage mitochondria, proteins and dna directly causes neuronal damage. in hypoxia-ischemia, ca2 influx, when intracellular ca2 accumulates to a certain level, activates nitric oxide synthase (nos), synthesizes a large amount of no, and nos has three different types. subtypes, neuronal and inducible nos mediate early and late neurotoxic effects, respectively, while no produced by endothelial cell type nos can dilate blood vessels and play a neuroprotective role. 7. apoptosis and delayed neuronal death in the past, neuronal injury after hypoxia-ischemia was caused by cell necrosis caused by acute energy failure, but it could not explain that children with asphyxia may have a transient relative normal period, but for several hours. after the appearance of delayed brain injury, studies have confirmed that hypoxia-ischemia can cause two different types of cell death, namely necrosis and apoptosis. delayed neuronal death is essentially apoptosis, detected in animal models. to the expression of a series of apoptosis-related genes. in short, the pathogenesis of hie is very complex, and it is the result of a series of biochemical chain reactions caused by a combination of various mechanisms. a large number of studies have confirmed that most neurons do not die from hypoxia-ischemia, but die from hypoxia from hours to days after the blood, this delayed cell death can be prevented or alleviated by interventions that begin after hypoxia-ischemia. the pathological changes of hie are closely related to gestational age, the nature and extent of injury. there are mainly four pathological types. one is cerebral hemisphere damage on both sides: mainly found in term infants, asphyxia is incomplete, and the first blood division between organs ( diving reflex) to ensure heart, cerebral blood supply, with hypoxia persistence, blood pressure drops, blood flow redistribution for the second time (brain shunt), that is, blood supply to the cerebral hemisphere is reduced due to vasoconstriction of the forebrain circulation, and the thalamus the blood supply to the brainstem and cerebellum increases due to vasodilation of the cerebral circulation. therefore, the cerebral hemisphere is more susceptible to damage, often accompanied by severe cerebral edema, and the second is basal ganglia, thalamic and brain stem damage: complete asphyxia, twice the compensatory mechanism of redistribution of blood flow is invalid. brain damage is mainly caused by thalamus and brainstem, while damage of extracranial organs and cerebral hemispheres is not serious, cerebral edema is mild, and third is white matter softening around the ventricles: mainly found in premature infants. hypoxic-ischemic ischemia around the lateral ventricle leads to the death of deep white matter brain cells, which is often symmetrically distributed. later, the lower extremity involvement may occur, and the fourth is the subventricular/intraventricular space around the ventricles.blood: mainly seen in premature children, the subependymal germinal tissue bleeding, with intraventricular hemorrhage.","['coma', 'sleepiness', 'muscle tension reduction', 'tendon reflex disappears', 'woody stiffness', 'consciousness disorder', 'front suffocation', 'sinus fetal heart rate', 'suffocation']",['hydrocephalus'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['supportive treatment includes optimizing ventilation and oxygenation, maintaining normal blood pressure, correcting acidosis, maintaining blood sugar, controlling convulsions, etc.;

neonatal scleredema,"neonatal sclerosing disease (neonatalscleredema), also known as neonatal sebaceosis, is mostly caused by cold, so it is also called cold injury syndrome, but it can also be caused by other factors such as infection in summer, so it is called infection. scleredema or scleredema in summer.this disease is one of the serious diseases of newborns. it is more common in premature infants or babies with congestive asphyxia and congenital malformations in the first 1-2 weeks after birth. it occurs mostly in the cold season, and can be seen in summer caused by infectious factors. the whole body is cold, the skin and subcutaneous fat are hard and edematous, and the feeling of ""cold pork"" is touched. in severe cases, it can cause pulmonary hemorrhage, dic, acute renal failure or secondary infection and death.the incidence of this disease is second only to pneumonia, and its mortality rate is still as high as 20-50% in recent years.however, with the improvement of medical technology and medical conditions, the cure rate of this disease has increased year by year.it has been reported that premature infants with a sclerosis of less than 1.5 kg can be cured and discharged by integrated chinese and western medicine.","1. do a good job in perinatal health care, strengthen prenatal care, and reduce the incidence of premature babies. 2, cold seasons and areas should be equipped with warm equipment for the delivery room. 3. once the newborn is delivered, wrap it in a warm towel and move it to a warm bed. 4. do a good temperature monitoring for high-risk children. 5, active early treatment of neonatal infectious diseases, does not cause scleredema.","the neonatal body surface area is relatively large, the skin is thin and tender, the blood vessels are rich, and it is easy to dissipate heat. the complex color fat is a unique tissue in the newborn, and its metabolism is the main source of energy when the newborn is in urgent need of heat production in a cold environment, and is hungry. the energy source is white fat. if the ambient temperature in children is too low, the heat is too much, the brown fat is easily depleted, the body temperature will drop, and the body temperature will not rise when the newborn is seriously infected. in these cases, the subcutaneous fat is easy to coagulate. it hardens, and at the same time, the surrounding capillaries expand at low temperature, the permeability increases, and edema is easy to occur, resulting in hard swelling. at low body temperature, peripheral circulation resistance decreases, blood stasis, tissue hypoxia, central blood circulation decreases, heart rate slows, urine volume decreases, and blood circulation increases during rewarming. if urine volume does not increase, heart failure may occur. even pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage occur. at low body temperature, hematocrit and blood viscosity increase, thrombocytopenia, heparin-like substances are also reduced, and various causes can cause coagulopathy, induce diffuse intravascular coagulation (dic), and dic is more likely to occur due to shock during severe infection. breathing slows down at low body temperature, sometimes apnea, prone to respiratory acidosis, and due to insufficient nutrient intake, resulting in metabolic acidosis, so severe fatty swollen acidosis is also heavier. at low body temperature, glucose metabolism is imperfect, and hyperglycemia may occur at the beginning of the disease, but hypoglycemia occurs after the increase in sugar consumption.","['hard inflammatory disease', 'purple sputum', 'heart failure', 'face pale', 'breathing difficulty', 'low temperature', 'no urine', 'extremity cool', 'hardening']","['acute renal failure', 'hypoglycemia', 'metabolic acidosis', 'pediatric pulmonary hemorrhage-nephritis syndrome']","['pediatrics', 'pediatric surgery']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'chinese medicine treatment']"
hemangioma,"hemangioma (haemangioma) is the most common congenital benign tumor in infants and young children. the incidence rate of yellow race is as high as 1%, and it has a unique disease course characterized by rapid hyperplasia and spontaneous regression.it originates from the residual embryonic vascular endothelial cells, and the active endothelium-like germ invades into adjacent tissues to form an endothelial-like strip. after tubeization, it is connected with the remaining blood vessels to form a hemangioma. the intratumoral blood vessels are self-contained and not surrounded by the surrounding blood vessels. the blood vessels are connected and are substantial tumors.the hemangioma that occurs in the oral and maxillofacial region accounts for 60% of systemic hemangioma, most of which occurs in facial skin, subcutaneous tissue and oral mucosa, such as tongue, lip, and fundus, and a few occur in the jaw or deep tissue. .because of its high incidence rate, and may lead to appearance damage or dysfunction, it brings a heavy economic burden and mental stress to children and their families, so it is of great significance for diagnosis and treatment.","it is generally a congenital benign tumor associated with embryonic development.at present, there is a theory that its formation has a certain relationship with the diet and life patterns during pregnancy, and more attention needs to be paid in this regard.","at present, most scholars believe that during the development of human embryos, especially in the early stage of vascular differentiation, due to the small-scale misconfiguration of the control gene segments, the tissue differentiation of specific parts is abnormal and develops into hemangioma. in the early embryonic period (8-december), the embryonic tissue is mechanically damaged. local tissue hemorrhage causes some hematopoietic stem cells to be distributed to other embryonic characteristic cells, some of which differentiate into vascular-like tissues and eventually form hemangioma. aneurysms are composed of a large number of proliferating blood vessels. in the early embryos, the primitive vessels are tubular bodies composed solely of endothelial cells. they form a dense network in the middle of the interstitial, and then with the development of various organs, the original veins. the pipe network gradually differentiates into many vascular plexuses and lymphatic plexus associated with organs. during the embryonic development of blood vessels, there are roughly plexus stage, reticular stage and tube dry stage. if obstacles or abnormalities occur during the normal development of a certain stage, abnormalities of normal developmental morphology at this stage may occur. in the plexus stage, if some capillaries stop developing, capillary hemangioma will occur; in the reticular stage, if the enlarged blood vessels gather into a mass and tend to fuse together, a cavernous hemangioma can be expressed. microscopically, the hemangioma has various forms, but the basic structure is similar, that is, there are well-developed vascular-like tissues, such as the outer layer, the middle layer and the intima epithelium. the diameter of the lumen is 1 to 10 mm, and there is connective between the blood vessels. the tissue is a matrix, and the common clinical hemangioma is cavernous hemangioma, capillary hemangioma and mixed type 3. 1. capillary hemangioma: has well-developed monolayer endothelial cells and a small amount of connective tissue as the matrix. there are only a small number of blood cells in the lumen, which is a localized lobulated mass with clear boundaries and slightly protruding on the skin surface. the color is bright red and varies in size. due to the narrow lumen, it rarely turns white when pressed. 2. cavernous hemangioma: has well-developed blood vessels, wide lumen, full of blood cells, soft body, protruding on the skin surface, unclear boundaries, purple blue, compressive, whitened after being compressed cavernous hemangioma is larger and thicker than capillary hemangioma, often invading subcutaneous tissue, and is dilatant, often invading deep tissues in the neck. 3. capillary-cavernous hemangioma (mixed type): it has the characteristics of the above two kinds of hemangioma, which is more common, and capillary hemangioma is often distributed on the surface of cavernous hemangioma.","['buck, food, middle three fingers...', 'diffuse vascular keratosis', 'liver congestion', 'vascular malformation', 'swallowing disorder', 'respiration obstruction', 'pu yushun']",['congestive heart failure'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['oral drugs, topical drugs, drug injections, lasers, surgical resection, radiation or freezing']"
congenital rubella,"congenital rubella or congenital rubella syndrome (congenitalrubellasyndrome) refers to pregnant women with rubella in the early pregnancy, rubella virus can pass through the placenta to infect the fetus, the newborn can be immature, can have congenital heart malformations, cataracts, deafness, developmental disorders, etc. once infected with rubella in the first month of pregnancy, the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome in the fetus can be as high as 50%, 30% in the second month, 20% in the third month, and 5% in the fourth month. he also believes that the infection of rubella after 4 months of pregnancy is not completely harmless to the fetus.","according to the us literature, about 20% of women of childbearing age in cities have a susceptibility to rubella. in the 1964 pandemic, about 3.6% of pregnant women were infected with rubella, but in non-popular years, the infection rate was only about 0.1%. 0.2%; the earlier the pregnant woman is infected with rubella, the more the fetus is infected, the infection rate is very low in the second trimester, and the fetus is not susceptible to infection in the later stage; in the pandemic, siegal et al observed 333 pregnant women with rubella in the early pregnancy. among them, 213 (64%) underwent induced abortion, 38 (11.4%) had spontaneous abortion. after the fetus was infected, 10-20% of the children died within 1 year after birth, which can be separated from the tissues and body fluids of the deceased. the rubella virus can also excrete viruses from the pharynx and urine several months after birth. this long-term virus-laden disease and continuous virus excretion are obviously serious threats to the surrounding health-susceptible people, especially pregnant women. for the prevention of congenital rubella syndrome, see the prevention of rubella above. it is worth noting that rubella re-infection can also affect the fetus during pregnancy. in pregnant women who have been vaccinated against rubella, the chance of re-infection is higher than that of pregnant women who have naturally suffered from rubella. much more, the increase of adrenal cortex hormones in the body during pregnancy, the cellular immune function is reduced, so the virus easily spread in the body, which affects the fetus. for non-pregnant people, rubella reinfection is almost asymptomatic, no viremia, just like the vaccine booster, resulting in increased antibody in the body, but pregnant women may have congenital rubella syndrome after reinfection, so even if pregnant women have been vaccinated against rubella, they should also attach importance to strict isolation from patients with rubella.","the principle of special teratogenicity caused by rubella virus is still not fully known. pregnant women are infected with rubella, and viremia is present 1 week before the rash. whether the maternal rubella infection can be transmitted to the fetus is related to the time when the mother is infected. at the 2nd to 6th week of the embryo, the infection has the greatest impact on the heart and eyes; in the second trimester, the fetus gradually develops immunity (such as the appearance of plasma cells and the production of igm), and the fetus's rubella infection is not as easy to construct as early pregnancy. chronic infection, according to kibrick et al (1974), the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome in the first month of pregnancy can be as high as 50%, 30% in the second month, 20% in the third month, the first month of pregnancy 5% of 4 months, and believe that the infection of rubella 4 months after pregnancy is not completely harmless to the fetus.","['hepatosplenomegaly', 'pigmentation spot', 'ear deafness', 'ventricular septal defect', 'cardiac malformation', 'small eyeball', 'thrombocytopenia', 'yue junqing', 'arterial catheter patency', ' corneal opacity', 'pulmonary stenosis']","['myocarditis', 'pancreatitis', 'hepatitis', 'digestive tract bleeding', 'thrombocytopenic purpura', 'anemia', 'nephrotic syndrome']",['infectious branch'],"['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
thromboangiitis obliterans,"thromboangiitis obliterans is referred to as vasculitis.it refers to a chronic persistent, progressive vascular inflammatory lesion of the surrounding vessels (middle, small arteries, and veins) that causes thrombosis to occlude the vascular lumen.more common in the northern provinces of china.more common in men and young adults.the lesions mainly involve the middle and small arteries of the distal extremities, and the veins and superficial veins are often involved, and the lower limbs are dominant.","in the cold season, you should pay attention to your body's warmth, especially limbs, diet, daily life, and sexual intercourse. eat less or not sticky foods, such as glutinous rice noodles, rice cakes, sesame sugar, etc., do not smoke, do not drink, feel comfortable, full. passion, full of energy to live, study, work, find patients with initial symptoms should go to the hospital for diagnosis, and actively treat, early detection, early treatment.","the etiology of thromboangiitis obliterans is still unclear. it is generally considered to be related to the following factors: (1) comprehensive domestic and international data on smoking, 60 to 95% of smokers with thromboangiitis obliterans, clinical observations, smoking cessation it can relieve the condition of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans, and re-smoking can make the disease worse. erb et al found in animal experiments in rats that tobacco extract can cause vascular lesions. harkavy et al used tobacco extract for intradermal test and found that thrombus occlusion the positive rate of patients with vasculitis is 78-87%, while that of normal people is only 16 to 46%. however, thromboangiitis obliterans in smokers is still a minority. some patients with thromboangiitis have no history of smoking. . therefore, smoking may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans, but it is not the only cause. (2) cold, damp, trauma the incidence of thromboangiitis obliterans in china is higher in the colder north. epidemiological investigations have found that 80% of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans have a history of cold and dampness before onset. some patients have a history of trauma, which may cause vasospasm and vascular endothelial damage, and lead to vascular inflammation and thromboembolism. (3) infection, malnutrition clinical observations found that many patients with thromboangiitis obliterans have a history of repeated mold infections, thompson found that patients with thromboangiitis obliterans have a positive rate of skin dermatan test of 80%, while the control group at only 20%, craven believes that the body's immune response to mold, induced blood fibrinogen increase and hypercoagulability may be related to the pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans. scholars in many countries have found that thromboangiitis obliterans is common in people with low economic income and low living standards. hill et al analyzed the thromboangiitis obliterans in indonesia and found that most patients lack protein in their diet, especially it is an essential amino acid, and some people have found that the lack of vitb1 and vitc in the diet can induce vasculitis in rats. therefore, protein, vitamin b1 and vitamin c deficiency may be related to this disease. (d) hormonal disorders thrombosis occlusive vasculitis patients are mostly male (80 ~ 90%), and all occur in young adults, some people believe that prostate dysfunction or excessive loss of prostatic fluid, can expand the body vascular and prostaglandins that inhibit platelet aggregation are reduced, and may cause vasomotor dysfunction of the surrounding blood vessels, resulting in thrombosis leading to the disease. (5) 1 to 5% of patients with hereditary thromboangiitis obliterans have a family history. many scholars have found that certain special sites of human leukocyte antigen (hla) are associated with the pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans. japanese scholars have discovered the positive rate of hla-j-1-1 in thromboangiitis obliterans was 46%, compared with only 18% in normal subjects. hla-bw54, hla-bw52 and hla-a were also reported in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans. the positive rate increased, and both hla-j and hla-bw54 were dominated by genetic factors. (6) vascular dysregulation the autonomic nervous system regulates dysfunction of endogenous or exogenous stimuli, which makes the blood vessels easy to be paralyzed. long-term vasospasm can damage the wall, hypertrophy, and easily form thrombus leading to vascular occlusion. . (7) autoimmune dysfunction for more than 10 years, the role of autoimmune factors in the pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans has been paid more and more attention, gulati et al found that serum igg, iga, and igm in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans increased, while complements ch50 and c3 decreased, and anti-arterial antibodies and immune complexes with strong affinity to arteries were found in the serum and diseased blood vessels of patients. smoler et al found in 20 cases of thromboangiitis obliterans. there were collagen antibodies in the case, but no collagen antibody was found in the control group. bollinger et al. and berlit found elastin antibodies in thromboangiitis obliterans. gulati et al. believe that smoking and other factors can change vascular antigenicity and produce itself. anti-arterial antibodies, the resulting immune complex deposited on the patient's blood vessels leads to vascular inflammatory responses and thrombosis.","['local skin of the limbs...', 'appears when the lower limbs are standing for a long time...', 'acute lower limb ischemia', 'purpura', 'calf ulcer', 'nutritive changes in the lower limbs', 'four limbs numb', 'muscle atrophy']",[],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
thoracic descending aortic aneurysm,"thoracic descending aortic aneurysm is the most common type of thoracic aortic aneurysm, occurring in the proximal descending aorta, distal to the left subclavian artery. the aorta of the lesion is mostly fusiform, varying in length, sometimes it may involve the full length of the descending aorta or even extend into the proximal segment of the abdominal aorta.in the past, the cause of descending aortic aneurysms was mostly syphilis. at present, most of them are caused by atherosclerotic lesions. others such as necrosis of the arteries, trauma and bacterial infection can also lead to the formation of descending aortic aneurysms.factors such as advanced age and hypertension increase the incidence of atherosclerotic lesions.the disease may not present any symptoms in the early stage. when the aneurysm grows up, it can compress the surrounding tissue to produce corresponding symptoms. patients often complain of chest pain between the shoulders of the back, and sometimes the pain is in the lower back, shoulders, upper limbs or neck.pain is a persistent dull pain, such as a sharp progression of chest pain, indicating that the aneurysm tends to rupture.if the aneurysm oppresses the left main bronchus, it can cause difficulty in breathing. if it is broken into the lungs or bronchus, it will produce hemoptysis.after a clear diagnosis by chest x-ray, the average survival time is about 3 years.","there is no effective preventive measure for this disease. early diagnosis and early treatment is the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease. however, in patients with giant aortic aneurysm, large aneurysms can be combined with larger wall thrombosis, so it is also possible to cause embolism due to thrombus shedding. and antiplatelet therapy may help prevent thrombosis.","in the past, the cause of descending aortic aneurysms was mostly syphilis. at present, most of them are caused by atherosclerotic lesions. older age, high blood pressure and other factors increase the incidence of atherosclerotic lesions. other causes are still traumatic, bacteria. sexual infections and necrosis of the middle layer of the artery.","[' dull pain', 'chest pain', 'sound hoarseness', 'breathing difficulty', 'hemoptysis']",['hemoptysis'],"['oncology', 'tumor surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
thoracic aortic dissection,"the aortic dissection is due to the rupture of the aortic intima and part of the middle layer, causing the middle layer of the aorta to tear, and the blood flows in the tear layer (false lumen). the original aortic cavity is called the true cavity.the true and false cavities are separated by an inner membrane and a partial middle layer, and have one and several breaches.sennertus in 1542, the disease was described in morgagni in 1761.in 1819, ren谷laennec first used the ""dissecting aneurysm"" to name the secondary disease.the aortic dissection is divided into acute and chronic according to the onset time, less than 14 days for the acute phase, 14 to 90 days for the subacute phase, and greater than 90 days for the chronic phase.acute aortic dissection although the aortic wall is separated from the false lumen, the entire aortic diameter does not significantly expand, so we now call the acute aortic dissection aortic dissection.with the passage of time, the false lumen wall after the separation of the aortic dissection is relatively weak. under the continuous pressure, the false lumen gradually expands and expands, so that the inner diameter of the whole aorta exceeds 1.5 times the inner diameter of the normal aorta, forming a dissecting artery. tumors, therefore, most of the dissection aneurysms are chronic aortic dissections.","there is no effective preventive measure for this disease. early diagnosis and early treatment is the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease. for patients undergoing surgery, the operative mortality rate of this disease is still high, and the lesions involve cases of ascending aorta. the operative mortality rate is about 20%. the lesion was limited to the descending aorta, and minimally invasive interventional therapy was available with a operative mortality rate of 5%.","first, the cause of aortic dissection is many, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, cystic necrosis of the arteries, marfan syndrome, aortic coarctation, aortitis, trauma and syphilis, except for the injury, its pathological basis both are changes in the middle aorta and smooth muscle. second, the pathological changes in the aortic wall middle layer degenerative lesions, the adhesion of each layer of tissue decreased, the aortic wall is affected by blood flow or vascular nourishment tube rupture caused by intimal rupture, then the middle layer of the aortic wall is peeled off, forming a thin outer layer layer-thick wall hematoma, the stress generated by the heart beat has the greatest influence on the ascending aorta and the proximal descending aorta, so 60 to 70% of cases of dissection aneurysm originate from the ascending aorta, and 25% originate from the proximal descending aorta about 90% of cases have hypertension. after the formation of the dissection aneurysm, it can extend to the distal aorta, involving the full length of the thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta and its branches; extending to the proximal aorta involves the coronary artery and aortic valve, leading to coronary circulation blockage or aortic valve insufficiency, dissection of the common carotid artery produces cerebral ischemic symptoms; intercostal artery involvement can lead to paralysis of spinal cord ischemia; renal artery involvement leads to kidney functional failure; sputum, femoral artery involvement can lead to limb necrosis. if the dissection aneurysm grows into the pericardial cavity or pleural cavity, the pericardial tamponade or massive hemothorax causes death. rupturing aneurysm of a patient into the inner aortic lumen, the aortic blood flow passageway formed two, aortic stripping process is no longer develop, the condition was alleviated. classification: in 1965, debakey was divided into three types according to the location and extent of dissection aneurysms, which were widely used in clinical practice. dissection of the aneurysm debakey classification type i: the intimal rupture is located in the ascending aorta, the aortic wall dissection originates from the ascending aorta, involving the aortic arch, descending the aorta, and extending to the abdominal aorta. type ii: the rupture of the intima is located in the ascending aorta, and the aortic wall is stripped to the ascending aorta. type iii: the proximal rupture of the intima is located in the proximal descending aorta at the distal end of the left subclavian artery. the aortic wall is detached toward the descending aorta and extends to the abdominal aorta, but does not involve the ascending aortic wall. stanford classification is divided into two types according to whether the ascending aorta is involved or not. type a: the rupture of the intima can be located in the ascending aorta, the aortic arch or the proximal descending aorta. the extent of the dissection aneurysm involves the ascending aorta, or even the aortic arch, descending aorta and abdominal aorta. the stanforda type is equivalent to the debakey type. type i and type ii, type a accounted for approximately 66% of the number of cases. type b: the rupture of the endometrium is often located in the proximal descending aorta. the extent of the dissection aneurysm is limited to the descending aorta or extending into the abdominal aorta, but does not involve the ascending aorta, which is equivalent to debakey type iii, and type b accounts for approximately 33%. .","['heart murmur', 'sustained chest pain...', 'shock', 'vascular murmur', 'purple', 'chest pain', 'pericardial tamponade', 'severe pain']",['coma'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

left ventricular dysplasia,"left heart dysplasia, the left heart dysplasia syndrome (hypoplasticleftheartsyndrome: hlhs) is a rare and complex congenital cardiovascular malformation with an incidence of about 1 to 27/100,000. it is characterized by a group of ascending aorta, aortic valve, left ventricle, and mitral dysplasia. congenital cardiovascular malformations.the incidence rate is about 16/100,000 live births, accounting for about 1.4% of congenital cardiovascular malformations..the common point of this type of malformation is that the left heart circulation has stenosis or atresia in a certain part, and the left atrium, pulmonary veins and pulmonary artery are dilated and the pressure is increased, so the blood flow in the right ventricle is increased, and the arterial catheter must be accompanied to survive.the incidence of such diseases in the east is low.left ventricular dysplasia varies, according to mitral and aortic valve morphology, can be divided into aortic and mitral stenosis, aortic and mitral valve atresia, aortic atresia with mitral stenosis and two mitral atresia with aortic stenosis.right heart enlargement of the left heart dysplasia syndrome, cardiac hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, arterial catheters tend to be large, and blood from the right ventricle is supplied to the body via the catheter.","professional guidance 1. age-appropriate marriage medicine has shown that the risk of fetal genetic abnormalities is significantly increased in pregnant women over the age of 35.therefore, it is best to give birth before the age of 35.if this is not possible, it is recommended that older pregnant women must undergo strict perinatal medical observation and care. 2. prepare to adjust the psychological and physiological state before preparing the child. if the expectant mother has the habit of smoking, drinking, etc., it is best to stop at least half a year before pregnancy. 3. strengthen health care for pregnant women especially in the early pregnancy, actively prevent rubella and flu such as rubella.pregnant women should try to avoid taking drugs. if they have to use them, they must be under the guidance of a doctor. 4. minimize exposure to adverse environmental factors such as radiation and electromagnetic radiation during pregnancy. 5. avoid going to high altitude areas during pregnancy because the incidence of congenital heart disease at high altitudes has been found to be significantly higher than in plain areas, it may be related to hypoxia.","causes: many chromosomal abnormalities and genetic syndromes are associated with cardiac dysplasia, and 25-30% of the fetuses we found to have cardiac dysplasia before birth are chromosomal abnormalities. exposure to certain substances or drugs during pregnancy, such as alcohol, lithium, vitamin a, anticonvulsants, reaction stop, steroids, amphetamines, anesthetics and oral contraceptives or large doses of radiation, etc., the chance of fetal heart dysplasia is about 1: 50. intrauterine infection with rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie virus may cause fetal heart malformation. pregnant women with diabetes have five times the chance of fetal heart malformation. pathogenesis: the main pathological features of this disease are: 1 aortic valve atresia or severe stenosis and ascending aorta dysplasia, about 35 to 80% of cases with aortic coarctation.2 mitral atresia or dysplasia.3 left ventricular is not developed.4 the right half of the heart hypertrophy showed an increase in the right atrium and right ventricle, especially the abnormal enlargement of the common pulmonary artery.5 there are large arterial catheters, atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale. classification: urban and schwarzenberg divide the intrinsic into five categories: 1. aortic atresia: a. with mitral dysplasia or stenosis; b. with mitral atresia. 2. mitral valve atresia. 3, mitral stenosis: a. normal aortic orifice; b. with aortic stenosis. 4, aortic arch dysplasia. 5, the aortic arch is locked or disconnected. noonan is divided into two categories: a. aortic atresia or severe stenosis; b. mitral atresia. hemodynamics: in the case of left ventricular dysplasia, the right atrium receives both the blood from the superior and inferior vena cava and the blood from the left atrium through the atrial septal defect.therefore, the body and pulmonary venous blood were pumped into the common pulmonary artery and left and right pulmonary artery by the right ventricle after mixing in the right atrium, and antegrade into the descending aorta through the thick arterial catheter, and retrograde perfusion of the ascending aorta and coronary artery.atrial septal defect and bifurcation of the arterial catheter are prerequisites for the completion of the body and pulmonary circulation in children with left ventricular dysplasia.moreover, the partial flow of the atrial septal defect and the arterial oxygen saturation are proportional to the size of the atrial septal defect.after birth, due to the significant decrease in pulmonary circulation resistance, pulmonary blood flow increased, and often accompanied by aortic coarctation and arterial catheter closure, so the body circulation resistance is higher.the ratio of body and lung blood flow is dysfunctional, resulting in pulmonary congestion, pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure, and insufficient blood perfusion of organs, hypoxemia and acidosis, and eventually death.","['hypoxemia', 'shock', 'purple', 'newborn bruising', 'breathing difficulty', 'breathing shortness', 'newborn hairpin', 'gas rush']",['shock'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment']"

main-pulmonary septal defect,"aortic-pulmonary septal defect or main-pulmonary window is a rare congenital major vascular malformation. according to stansel in 1977, there are fewer than 100 cases reported in the literature. the defect or window is located in the ascending aorta. the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations between the main pulmonary artery and the main pulmonary artery resemble patent ductus arteriosus.the semilunar valve development of the aorta and pulmonary arteries is normal, and abnormal traffic occurs between the two arterial trunks, usually accompanied by other complex cardiovascular malformations.at the 5th to 8th week of the embryonic period, the main-pulmonary artery divides the arterial trunk into the ascending aorta and the common pulmonary artery.during the same period, the interventricular septum divides the ventricular cavity into the left and right ventricles. the lower part of the final arterial septum merges with the upper part of the interventricular septum, allowing the left and right ventricles to communicate with the aorta and pulmonary artery, respectively.if the above separation is not perfect, according to its position, the main-pulmonary septal defect, permanent arterial trunk or high ventricular septal defect will be formed.large defects, due to large partial flow, may have recurrent respiratory infections and chronic heart failure, growth and development are limited, with the increase of pulmonary vascular resistance, there may be post-activity palpitations and shortness of breath. type cyan.","the disease is congenital macrovascular malformation, so there is no effective preventive measures at present, early detection and early treatment should be found early.","pathogenesis the main-pulmonary septal defect leads to a cyclical physiological abnormality.in the early stage, due to the large amount of blood flow, the autonomic artery was shunted to the pulmonary artery, and the blood volume of the pulmonary venous return to the left heart chamber increased, which aggravated the left ventricular burden, thus causing left ventricular hypertrophy and strain, while the systemic blood flow was relatively insufficient, resulting in dysplasia or retardation. .due to congestion of the lungs, it is easy to cause respiratory infections.in the later stage, secondary lesions such as thickening of the wall and small lumen of the pulmonary arterioles increased pulmonary resistance, increased pressure, and excessive load on the right ventricle, causing hypertrophy of the left and right ventricles.when the pulmonary artery pressure is higher than the aorta, a reverse (right to left) shunt is formed, and systemic purpura appears. pathological change a typical primary-pulmonary septal defect is anatomically located just above the aortic valve, forming an aortic root that communicates with the common pulmonary artery.defective diameters can range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters, typically above 1 cm.some patients have larger diameters and the lower edge is very close to the aortic valve, which is difficult to distinguish from the persistent arterial trunk.","[ 'cyanosis', 'ventricular hypertrophy', 'weakness', 'palpitation', 'be out of breath']","['congestive heart failure', 'pulmonary hypertension', 'atrial septal defect']","['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment improves heart function']"
aortic dissection,"aortic dissection, the aortic dissection of the aortic artery wall, used to be called a dissection aortic aneurysm (dissectionaorticaneurysm), refers to the aortic wall in the aortic wall and part of the middle layer rupture caused by various causes, blood the middle layer is torn through the rupture into the middle layer of the aortic wall, resulting in stratification of the vessel wall (false lumen).the blood flows in the tear layer (false cavity), and the original aortic cavity is called the true cavity.the inner cavity and the false cavity are separated by an inner membrane and a part of the middle layer, and one of them has a plurality of openings.however, coady reported that there are no intimal tears in 8% to 15% of cases, which may be due to intramural trophoblastic hemorrhage in the aortic wall, also known as intramural hematoma (intramuralhematoma), which is associated with the aortic dissection. different diseases of acute aortic syndrome.the aorta of the aortic dissection does not dilate and may be different from an aortic aneurysm.","the disease is rare, the incidence rate is about 5 to 10 cases per million people per year, but more rapid onset, 65% to 75% of patients in the acute phase (within 2 weeks) die of cardiac tamponade, arrhythmia and other cardiac complications, the peak age is 50-70 years old. the male incidence rate is higher than that of females. the ratio of male to female is 2~3:1. according to the onset time, it is divided into acute phase and chronic phase: the onset is acute within 2 weeks, more than 2 weeks. in the chronic phase, according to the extent of the intimal tear site and the aortic dissection aneurysm, it can be divided into type a: the intimal tear can be located in the ascending aorta, the aortic arch or the proximal descending aorta, and the extension can involve the ascending aorta. the arch can also extend to the descending aorta or even the abdominal aorta. type b: the intimal tear is often located in the aortic isthmus. the extension only affects the descending aorta or extends to the abdominal aorta, but does not involve the ascending aorta. most cases die within a few hours to several days after onset. the hourly mortality rate is 1% to 2% within the first 24 hours, depending on the location, extent and extent of the lesion. the more distal, the smaller the range, the amount of bleeding. less prognosis is better. patients with high blood pressure should monitor blood pressure changes at least twice a day, adopt a healthy lifestyle, use drugs to control blood pressure in a normal range, appropriately limit physical activity, and avoid excessive exercise to induce disease, accompanied by patients with aortic valve mitral valve malformation and ma fang syndrome should limit severe activities, regular physical examination, monitoring changes in the condition, and timely surgical treatment to prevent the occurrence of aortic dissection.","(1) causes of the disease the cause is still unknown. cystic degeneration degenerative changes in the middle aorta, ie collagen and elastic tissue degeneration, often accompanied by cystic changes, are considered to be prerequisites for aortic dissection. cystic middle degeneration is an intrinsic feature of connective tissue genetic defects, especially in marfan. syndrome and ehler-danlos syndrome, aortic dissection, especially proximal dissection, is often a serious and common complication of marfan syndrome. it has been reported that 6% to 9% of patients with aortic dissection are marfan syndrome. recently, aortic dissection has been reported in patients with noonan and turner syndrome. cystic middle degeneration may be a common problem. there is an unexplained relationship between pregnancy and aortic dissection. female aorta under 40 years old. about half of the dissection occurs during pregnancy, and occurs mostly within 3 months of pregnancy or early in the puerperium. women with marfan syndrome and aortic root dilatation have an increased risk of acute aortic dissection during pregnancy, blood volume, cardiac output. increases in volume and blood pressure may also be risk factors during pregnancy but have not been confirmed. hypertension more than 80% of patients with aortic dissection have hypertension, and many patients have cystic necrosis. hypertension is not the cause of cystic necrosis, but it can promote its development. hypertension is an important factor leading to dissection, about half of which is near end and almost all of the distal aortic dissection have hypertension, elevated blood pressure in acute attacks, sometimes accompanied by aortic atherosclerotic ulcer surface, because long-term hypertension can cause smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, degeneration and middle necrosis . trauma direct trauma can cause aortic dissection, blunt contusion can cause local aortic tear, hematoma formation of aortic dissection, intra-aortic intubation or intra-aortic balloon intubation can cause aortic dissection, cardiac surgery for example, aortic-coronary artery bypass grafting can also cause aortic dissection. (two) pathogenesis the basic lesion of this disease is cystic middle layer necrosis. the middle elastic fiber of the artery has local rupture or necrosis. the matrix has mucous-like and cyst formation. the aortic wall divides into two layers, with blood and blood clots accumulating. it is fusiform or saclike. if the lesion is involved in the aortic annulus, the ring enlarges and causes aortic regurgitation. the lesion can be extended from the aortic root to the distal, up to the radial artery and femoral artery. involving the branches of the aorta, such as the innominate artery, the common carotid artery, the subclavian artery, the renal artery, etc., the coronary artery is generally unaffected, but the clot of the aortic root may have an oppressive effect on the opening of the coronary artery, and the origin of most dissections the transverse rupture of the intima is often located above the aortic valve. there are also two ruptures. the dissection is in communication with the aortic cavity. the inner membrane of a few dissections is intact and there is no rupture. in some cases, the outer membrane ruptures and causes massive hemorrhage. in the ascending aorta, bleeding easily enters the pericardial cavity, and the lower rupture site can also enter the mediastinum. the chest cavity is easy to enter the pericardial cavity, and the lower rupture site can also enter.septal, thoracic or retroperitoneal space, a chronically dissected dissection can form a double-chamber aorta, one tube nested in another, this condition is seen in the descending branch of the thoracic aorta or aortic arch, debakey divides the aortic dissection into type 3: type i sandwiches from the ascending aorta and descend to the descending aorta, type ii is confined to the ascending aorta, type iii dissection extends from the descending aorta and extends distally. in addition, daily and miller divide the aortic dissection for the two types: those with ascending aorta are type a (including debakey type i and type ii), and the distal end of the left subclavian artery is type b (ie debakey type iii), and type a accounts for about 2/3 of all cases. type b accounts for about 1/3. aortic cystic degeneration leads to repeated flexion of the aorta, hemodynamics and trauma caused by hypertension in the aorta, causing aortic intimal tear to form a dissection hematoma, about 60% of tears occur in the ascending arteries, 10% in the aortic arch, 30% in the first part of the descending thoracic aorta, the depth of the mesenteral invasion and the distance of the mesothelial spread, are related to the extent of aortic degeneration, the blood in the aortic lumen enters the middle layer, the endometrium separated from the middle layer, the separation of the wall generally develops toward the distal end of the artery, and can also extend upwards in a short distance. the aortic dissection spirals in the wall of the arterial tube, and when it is widely sandwiched, it can be involved. the branch affects the blood supply of the adjacent organs; or the middle layer first has hemorrhage, forming a hematoma, and the longitudinal development divides the aortic cavity into a true cavity and a false cavity, and the rupture of the false cavity causes the blood to return to the arterial cavity to form a ""natural cure.""

aorta,"aortic aneurysm (aorticaneurysm) refers to a local or diffuse abnormal expansion of the aortic wall. the maximum internal diameter of the aorta exceeds 1.5 times the inner diameter of the normal aorta.when the aortic aneurysm continues to increase, it can compress the surrounding organs and cause symptoms. the rupture of the tumor is the main risk.often occurs in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, thoracic descending aorta, thoracic and abdominal aorta, and abdominal aorta.aortic aneurysms are classified into true aortic aneurysms and pseudo-aortic aneurysms.true aneurysms are caused by the expansion and widening of the three-layer structure of the blood vessel wall.pseudoaneurysm is a partial penetrating rupture of the arterial wall. the blood flows out of the blood vessel and is closed and solidified by the dense tissue around the blood vessel, forming a tumor with blood around the center of the thrombus.","1. regular follow-up of at least 6 months to 1 year is necessary to determine the changes in the aorta by performing ct-enhanced angiography or enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the aorta. 2. patients with hypertension should control their blood pressure.some activities that can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure (such as: intense activity, mental stress, going to the bathroom, in the cold) should be avoided. 3. it is impossible to completely prevent the rupture of large aneurysms.when the tumor is large enough, surgery should be selected as soon as possible. 4, advanced age, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other circulatory diseases, patients with a family history of aneurysms, are at high risk. 5, we should also pay attention to develop good living habits to prevent the formation of atherosclerosis.","the normal arterial wall includes the intima, the middle layer and the outer membrane. the middle layer is rich in elastic fibers and collagen fibers. the middle layer is damaged, the elastic fibers are broken, and the fibrous scar tissue is replaced. the arterial wall loses its elasticity and cannot withstand blood flow impact. the artery is in the artery. the lesions gradually enlarge and form an aneurysm. the increase of intra-arterial pressure helps to form an aneurysm. the main causes of main aortic aneurysm are as follows: (1) atherosclerosis is the most common cause, atheromatous plaque erosion the arterial wall destroys the middle layer, the elastic fiber undergoes degeneration, the wall becomes thickened by atherosclerosis, the nourishing blood vessels are compressed, the nutrition disorder occurs, or the nourishing blood vessels rupture and the blood in the middle layer is more common in older men, men and women. the ratio is about 10:1, and the site is mainly in the abdominal aorta. it can also be seen in the thoracic aorta and the thoracic and aorta. (b) infection with syphilis is significant, often eroding the thoracic aorta.bacteremia causes the bacteria to reach the aorta through the bloodstream. the abscess adjacent to the aorta spreads directly, or the infection is secondary to the atherosclerotic ulcer. the bacterial aneurysm can be formed. the pathogen is streptococcus, grape. cocci and salmonella are dominant and less common. (c) cystic middle necrosis is a relatively rare pathological unexplained lesion, aortic middle elastic fiber rupture, replaced by metachromatic acid mucopolysaccharide, mainly seen in ascending aortic aneurysm, more common in men, hereditary diseases such as marfan syndrome, turner syndrome, ehlers-danlos syndrome, etc. can have cystic necrosis, easy to cause dissection aneurysms. (4) traumatic penetrating injury directly affects the aorta caused by the aorta in the injured area, which can occur in any part. indirect injury often acts on non-movable parts, such as the distal end of the left subclavian artery or the ascending aorta. the root, rather than the easily movable part, is more likely to form an aneurysm when subjected to more stress.

aortic stenosis,"aortic stenosis is a common valvular heart disease, which refers to an increase in the opening of the aortic valve, resulting in increased resistance to blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta when the left ventricle contracts.in western developed countries, it has gradually become a common valvular heart disease after mitral valve prolapse. the cause of aortic stenosis can be congenital or acquired. the main pathophysiological basis is that the left ventricular afterload is significantly increased. cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac output decreased.the normal aortic valve area is more than 3.0~4.0cm2. generally, when the aortic valve area is reduced to 1/3~1/4 of normal, significant hemodynamic changes can occur, and the patient has symptoms.when the valve area is reduced to 1.5cm2, it is mildly narrow, the valve area is moderately narrow when the area is 0.75~1.0cm2, and severely narrow when it is <0.75cm2.surgical treatment is aortic valve replacement. the risk and prognosis of surgery depends mainly on left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular function. in north america and europe, aortic stenosis is mainly seen in the elderly, caused by valvular scarring and calcification.aortic stenosis caused by this cause often occurs after the age of 60, and often has no symptoms before 70 to 80 years old.the disease can also be caused by rheumatic fever (which occurs mostly in children).aortic stenosis caused by rheumatic fever is often associated with mitral valve disease, including stenosis, reflux, or both. in young people, the most common cause of aortic stenosis is birth defects (see birth defects).in infancy, a narrow aortic valve may not be a problem, but it will gradually become a prominent problem as it ages.when their heart grows with age, the aortic valve is still the original size, the valve may have only two leaves instead of the normal three-leaf, or the shape of the valve is abnormal.over time, the valve becomes stiff and narrow due to calcium salt deposition.","rheumatic heart disease can be prevented. if it can effectively control the infection of nail chain pharyngitis, rheumatic fever will not be obtained, and rheumatic heart disease will not occur. the main preventive measures are as follows: 1. primary prevention refers to the prevention of rheumatic fever for the first time. the key to the onset is early diagnosis and treatment of methyl chain tonsillitis. anyone with fever, sore throat or discomfort, headache, abdominal pain, pharyngeal congestion and sputum tonsil secretion should be swallowed before treatment to determine the presence or absence of a chain. growth, if positive, should start antibiotic treatment immediately. in addition to penicillin allergy, penicillin should be the drug of choice for all patients, for the following reasons: 1 all strains of streptococcus hemolyticus are equally sensitive to penicillin. 2 after applying for more than 40 years, the average bacteriostatic and bactericidal concentration of penicillin against this bacteria did not change, still around 0.005米g/ml. 3 there is no sign of resistance to penicillin. 4 there is no other antibiotic anti-streptococcal infection activity and clinical effect than penicillin g. 5 penicillin is relatively inexpensive, the antibacterial spectrum is narrow, so it will not inhibit the normal flora, can avoid double infection, and has fewer side effects than other effective antibiotics. beta-penicillin is suitable for patients who can not complete oral penicillin treatment for 10 days; personal history or family history; or geographical, socio-economic environment in patients with high rf area, intramuscular injection of benzathine alone is more painful, injection with benzathine penicillin plus procaine penicillin injection is not painful, mixed injection the dose of benzathine penicillin should be: 600,000 u for patients <27 kg and 1.2 million u for patients with >27 kg. for most small patients, a mixture of benzathine penicillin 900,000 u and procaine penicillin 300,000 u good results can be obtained, but this preparation is not suitable for adolescent or adult patients. for areas with low rf incidence, penicillin v can be treated orally. penicillin v has acid stability and absorption, and the concentration of penicillin produced is higher. high, for children and adults, the dose is 250mg, 3 times / d, a total of 10 days, must emphasize the importance of continuous medication for 10 days, even if the symptoms disappear after a few days of medication, should be served for 10 days, less than 10 day effect significantly reduced, but more than 10 days can not increase the efficacy, its treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis is the same or almost the same as oral penicillin, for adults, 2 times / d drug efficacy is not reliable, 3 to 4 times / d is better , but the maximum dose does not exceed 1g / d, followed by cephalosporin iv, vi 0.25g, 4 times / d, a total of 10 days, but can not be used for patients with penicillin anaphylactic shock, tetracycline has not been produced in china, sulfadiazine can not eliminate the chain cocci, therefore not used to treat streptococcal angina, but continuous use of sulfadiazine is effective in preventing rf recurrence. 2, secondary prevention (prevention of recurrence of rheumatic fever) for patients with a clear history of rheumatic fever or existing rheumatoid patients need continuous antibiotic treatment to prevent recurrence of rheumatic fever. (1) precautionary period: depending on the risk of recurrence, in general, people with upper respiratory tract infections, crowded living, poor medical conditions, and multiple episodes of history have a high risk of recurrence and a long time to prevent medication. on the contrary, it can be shortened appropriately. patients with rheumatoid carditis have a relatively high risk of recurrence of carditis. they should receive long-term antibiotic prophylaxis until adult or lifelong prevention. on the contrary, patients who have not had rheumatic carditis have recurrence. the risk of involvement is low and antibiotic prophylaxis can be stopped in a few years. in general, prevention should last until at least 5 years after the patient reaches the twenties or the last rheumatic fever. (2) prevention program: 1 intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin g: commonly used is long-acting penicillin preparation benzathine penicillin g 1.2 million u, intramuscular injection, once every 4 weeks, in acute rf high-risk countries and regions, as well as high-risk patients it is best to intramuscularly once every 3 weeks. 2 oral antibiotics: patients with low risk of rf recurrence, such as those who have reached the end of puberty or adolescence or at least 5 years without recurrent rheumatic fever, can be changed to oral antibiotic prophylaxis, according to the recommended doses: a, sulfadiazine: weight > 27kg, dose 1.0g, 1 time / d, weight P 27kg, 0.5g per day, side effects are light and rare, occasionally can cause leukopenia, blood cell count should be checked every 2 weeks, patients with late pregnancy are prohibited, because sulfadiazine penetrates the placental barrier and competes with the bilirubin in the fetus for albumin binding sites. b, penicillin v: the dose is 250mg, 2 times / d, the allergic reaction is the same as intramuscular penicillin, it should be used as a penicillin skin test before use. c, erythromycin: 250mg, 2 times / d, suitable for allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs. d, chinese medicine such as honeysuckle, berberine, astragalus, phellodendron, dandelion, banlangen, andrographis paniculata; chinese patent medicines such as yinhuang tablets, yinqiao tablets, anti-inflammatory tablets, silver yellow needles, etc. have good effects on hemolytic streptococcal infection, choose application. according to a recent wh0 report, 33,651 patients with rf or rhd were enrolled in secondary prevention for treatment in 1986-1990, but only about 63.2% of patients completed secondary prevention, 95.7% of whom used long-acting penicillin. intramuscular injection once, 2.1% oral penicillin, 0.1% sulfadiazine, 2.1% erythromycin, 0.3% of patients had adverse reactions to penicillin, 53 cases of rf recurrence, accounting for 0.4% of patients/year, if not prevented the recurrence rate of rheumatic fever is as high as 60% of patients per year.","the etiology of aortic stenosis varies greatly with age. currently, it is 38% in the western bicuspid aortic malformation station in the west, and 33% in the elderly degenerative calcification lesions, rheumatic or infectious fibrous calcification. the lesions accounted for 24%, and the others accounted for 4%. in china, it is also gradually closer to the above data. rheumatic fever is a common cause of aortic stenosis in young patients. the pathological changes are first of all three inflammatory edema, lymphocytic infiltration and neovascularization, and then fibrosis thickening of the valve leaflets, with varying degrees of junction the fusion, due to the retraction and stiffness of the free edge of the leaflet, makes the valve opening irregular. rheumatic aortic lesions often involve mitral or tricuspid valve disease. simple aortic stenosis is relatively rare. rheumatic aortic stenosis is rare in western countries and is gradually decreasing in china. it can be single leaf, two leaf or three leaf. the single-leaf type is already stenotic at birth, and the fissure and calcification of the valve are progressively aggravated, causing severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and the child dies within a year. 50% of congenital aortic stenosis is bilobal and 30% is trifoliate. the two kinds of leaflet malformations may have no obvious stenosis in the childhood valve mouth, but the abnormal leaflet structure degenerates due to eddy current impact, causing thickening of the valve leaflets, calcification, stiffness, and finally leading to narrowing of the valve orifice, and may also be combined with insufficiency. calcium deposits gradually occur on the aortic valve of the second leaf after 30 years of age. after 50 years of age, calcification is severe, and aortic stenosis occurs. therefore, the majority of adults with simple aortic stenosis, especially in patients under 60 years of age, are calcified aortic stenosis on the congenital bicuspid aortic valve. this lesion is characterized by calcification that can affect the valve leaflets, annulus, and junction areas, often in cauliflower-like masses, with aortic valves often fissure-like, with few aortic regurgitation. it is a degenerative change, accounting for 18% of elderly patients, and more elderly people with normal aortic valve over 65 years old. the valve undergoes degenerative changes, fibrosis and calcification, and leaflet fusion. the stenosis of the valve is relatively light, and some patients may be accompanied by a regurgitation. pathogenesis the main pathophysiological changes after aortic stenosis are increased left ventricular resistance during systole, which increases left ventricular contractility to increase transvalvular pressure gradient and maintain normal cardiac output at rest.this gradually causes left ventricular hypertrophy, leading to decreased left ventricular diastolic compliance, increased end-diastolic pressure; although resting cardiac output is still normal, but increased cardiac output during exercise.after severe stenosis of the valve, the pressure gradient of the transvalvular pressure is reduced, left atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary compression and right ventricular pressure can be increased, and cardiac output is reduced.decreased cardiac output can cause hypoxia, hypotension and arrhythmia, and insufficient blood supply to the brain can cause dizziness, syncope and other manifestations of cerebral hypoxia.left ventricular hypertrophy, increased contractility, significantly increased myocardial oxygen consumption, further aggravating myocardial ischemia.","['difficulty breathing', 'systolic murmur', 'angina pectoris', 'paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea', 'arrhythmia', 'sudden death', 'loss of consciousness', 'endocardial elastic fiber hyperplasia', 'end sit in the breath']",['endocarditis'],"['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
aortic insufficiency,"aortic insufficiency (aorticinsufficlency) is a common valvular heart disease, accounting for about 25% of valvular heart disease.the causes of aortic regurgitation include congenital and acquired, but the latter are mostly, and most of them are caused by aortic valve disease, while aortic root lesions affect the aortic sinus junction and/or annulus. it can also cause aortic regurgitation.the main pathophysiological basis of aortic regurgitation is increased left ventricular preload, left ventricular hypertrophy and enlargement.surgical treatment is mainly aortic valve replacement, and some patients can do angioplasty.surgical risk and prognosis mainly depend on preoperative left ventricular function.","for aortic regurgitation with asymptomatic and normal left ventricular function, it should be checked every six months or when symptoms appear, to limit physical activity, to avoid the use of drugs that inhibit myocardium, such as propranolol, if there is no surgical treatment when angina occurs, often can be dying, so should strive for timely surgery, can not wait and see, such as acute onset, because the left ventricular tolerance is very limited, once the appearance of left heart failure, the prognosis is extremely dangerous, should be operated early, even when the heart is significantly enlarged without symptoms, digitalis drugs and other cardiac-lowering drugs should be given as soon as possible. because the patients are very resistant to atrial fibrillation and slow arrhythmia, they should be actively prevented and treated. prone to concurrent infective endocarditis, preventive measures should be taken.","it is the most common cause of aortic regurgitation in china and developing countries. due to fibrosis, thickening and shortening of the leaflets, the edge of the diastolic valve leaflets is affected. simple aortic regurgitation is rare in rheumatic heart disease, often due to fusion of the valve junction with varying degrees of stenosis, often combined with mitral valve damage. it is also a common cause and ranks second in developed countries in the west. infectious neoplasms cause the leaflets to be damaged or perforated, and the leaflets are prolapsed due to impaired support structure or the mites are blocked between the leaflets to cause closure. even if the infection has been controlled, leaflet fibrosis and contracture can continue. depending on how fast the damage progresses, it can manifest as acute, subacute or chronic insufficiency. aortic annulus dilatation: it is a common cause of simple aortic regurgitation in western developed countries. the pathological anatomical features are that the aortic valve leaflets are basically normal, the aortic sinus tube junction and the aortic annulus are enlarged, causing a poor aortic valve commissure or a large gap, resulting in insufficiency of the valve. common causes include marfan syndrome, idiopathic aortic dilatation or ascending aortic aneurysm, ascending aortic dissection, degenerative aortic dilation, syphilis, and the like. 1 the incidence of bicuspid aortic valve accounts for about 1% to 2% of the population, and most of them can maintain normal valve function for life. however, in some cases, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, or both may occur. the case of incomplete closure is mainly due to prolapse of the valve leaflet on one side, resulting in insufficiency of the valve. the leaflets are often thickened, and the valve margin can be contracted, but generally there is no obvious calcification. 2 high ventricular septal defect or membranous ventricular dysplasia caused by aortic valve prolapse caused by valve insufficiency, followed by aortic sinus tumor rupture with corresponding valve leaf prolapse. aortic valve mucoid degeneration: caused the valve leaf to prolapse into the left ventricle during diastole. occasionally combined with cystic necrosis in the aortic root, may be a congenital cause. traumatic or iatrogenic: clinically rare. aortic valve regurgitation caused by trauma is more common in severe chest crush injury or impact injury. the pressure in the pleural cavity suddenly increases, and the arterial pressure suddenly increases, causing tearing of the valve leaflet and causing acute aortic regurgitation. other causes: ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell aortitis, etc. can cause aortic regurgitation.","['syncope', 'femoral gunshots', 'tiredness', 'breathing difficulties', 'jugular vein anger', 'unstable angina', 'dizziness', 'heart palpitations', 'sit sitting breath']",['congestive heart failure'],"['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

amoebic liver abscess,"amoebic liver abscess (amebicliverabsces) is a complication of amoebic colitis due to the formation of necrosis of the liver through the blood flow of the amebic trophozoite into the liver from the intestinal lesion.long-term fever, right upper abdomen or lower right chest pain, systemic consumption and hepatomegaly tenderness, leukocytosis, etc. are the main clinical manifestations, and easily lead to chest complications.the ileocecal and ascending colon are the predilection sites of amoebic colitis, where the protozoa can return to the right lobe of the liver with the superior mesenteric vein, and the right lobe of the liver is larger than the left lobe, and there is more blood return. therefore, clinically seen in patients, more than 90% of abscesses are in the right lobe, and more at the top.the place with high incidence in china is in the south, and the rural areas are higher than the urban areas. the male incidence rate is higher than that of females, and the age of onset is 30-40 years old.intestinal amebiasis complicated with liver abscess accounted for 1.8% to 20%, up to 67%.","as long as strict manure management, hygiene, and timely

amebic liver abscess.chinese medicine brucea javanica and pulsatilla chinensis also have preventive and therapeutic effects on acute and chronic amebic bowel disease.","(1) the cause of the disease: e. histolytica has two phases of trophozoites and cysts. the trophozoites have been divided into small trophozoites and large trophozoites. the former is parasitic in the intestinal lumen and is called the intestinal commensal trophozoite. under the influence of certain factors, it can invade the intestinal wall, and the phagocytic red blood cells are transformed into the latter, which is called tissue trophozoite. in recent years, molecular taxonomic studies have confirmed that the genotypes and phenotypes of the two types of insect strains have obvious specificity. in 1993, the world health organization officially named the non-pathogenic strain dispaneba (entamoeba) based on its isozyme spectrum, the apparent difference between membrane antigen and virulence protein and coding gene. dispar), and the pathogenic strain is still called entamoeba histolytica. therefore, most of the trophozoites that exist in the intestinal lumen are considered to be sympathetic to the intestinal tract. the organism does not invade the intestinal wall, and the trophozoites of the amoeba in the lytic tissue are invasive regardless of their size, and can phagocytose red blood cells at any time, so the omnivorous red blood cells or the erythrocytes that do not phagocytose the red tissue are nourished by the amoeba. nourishment trophozoites in patients fresh mucous stool or liquid liver abscess are lively active, 5米m / s, to binary fission proliferation, morphological changes is large. when it is in the tissue of a symptomatic patient, it often contains red blood cells, which are usually 20-40 米m or even 50 米m, but in the non-diarrhea feces of the intestinal cavity or in the culture medium, the size is 10-30 米m, excluding red blood cells, nourish the body, the external matter boundary is very obvious. with a single directed pseudopod movement, there is a vesicular nucleus in the endoplasm, which is spherical, with a diameter of 4-7 米m. there is a single layer uniformly distributed at the edge of the nuclear membrane. staining plasmid (chromatin granule), small nucleolus (only 0.5米m), often in the middle, surrounded by a filamentous structure, cystic trophozoites formed in the intestine, but not in the organs outside the intestine or outside in the intestinal lumen, the trophozoite gradually shrinks, stops the activity, becomes the approximate spherical pre-encapsulation, and later becomes a nuclear capsule, and undergoes two-splitting hyperplasia, which develops into a mature capsule of four cores with a diameter of 10~ 16米m, wall thickness 125-150nm, the morphology of the amoeba trophozoite in the dissolved tissue, observed by scanning electron microscopy or fluoroscopy, the cell membrane thickness is about 10nm, the outer skin is a layer of fluffy glycocalyx, cytoplasm contains countless glycogen granules and helically arranged ribosomes, no typical mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum and golgi complex. there are many filamentous protrusions on the surface of the trophozoite, with circular holes of 0.2-0.4 米m in diameter, and microcells. related to micropinocytosis, there are no such pores in the pseudopod and micro-drinking nozzles, which is one of the characteristics of the amoeba trophozoites in the lysate. the in vitro culture of e. histolytica has entered monoxenic culture from xenic culture, and has been developed into axenic cultivation and clonal culture in soft agar medium. the success of biological culture has provided the conditions for in-depth study of amoeba, and solved the problem of preparation of pure antigen. the development of amoebic liver abscess is slow, and it is longer after intestinal amebiasis or amoebic infection. during the occult period, overeating can cause intestinal inflammation, and it is easy to make amoeba infection into activity; alcoholism and other conditions sufficient to reduce the body's resistance can cause the cause of liver abscess, re-infection of amoeba it can stimulate the existing infection and cause liver abscess; the application of adrenal cortex hormone can also induce the occurrence of liver abscess. (two) pathogenesis in the colon ulcer, the amoebic trophozoite enters the portal system through its invasive force and reaches the liver; but it can also directly invade the liver through the intestinal wall or reach the liver through the lymphatic system. most protozoa are destroyed after reaching the liver, only a few can be eliminated. survival and reproduction in the liver, amoebic trophozoites in the portal vein of the liver due to embolism, dissolution and division, causing local liquefaction necrosis and the formation of abscesses, from the invasion of protozoa to the formation of abscess, on average takes more than 1 month, the location of the abscess is indeterminate. it is more common in large individuals. about 80% is located in the right lobe of the liver, especially in the top of the right lobe. the blood received from the right lobe is due to the cecum and ascending colon of the main lesion of the intestinal amoeba. because the protozoa spread through the portal vein, early multiple small abscesses are more common, and then merge with each other to form a single large abscess. the center of the abscess is a large necrotic area, and the pus is liquefied liver tissue, which is chocolate-like. viscous or thin, with livery smell, liver cells containing lysis and necrosis, red blood cells, white blood cells, fat, summer-ray crystals and residual tissue, trophozoitesgathered in the wall of the abscess, about 1/3 of the cases can find trophozoites in the pus, but no cysts have been found. the abscess can be enlarged and gradually superficialized, so that it can be worn to the adjacent body cavity or organ. chronic abscess can cause bacterial secondary infections, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus, proteus, aerobacteria and alcaligenes, etc. after bacterial infection, the pus loses its typical characteristics, yellow or yellow-green, smelly, and there are a large number of pus cells, and clinical manifestations of toxemia can occur.","['fever fever', 'liver metastasis', 'fecal pus and blood', 'low heat and fatigue', 'living', 'low fever', 'relaxation heat', 'liver pain']",['heavy pericarditis'],"['other departments', 'rehabilitation']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
carbamate pesticide poisoning,"carbamate pesticides are synthetic pesticides developed after organophosphate pesticides. the toxicity of general varieties is lower than that of organophosphorus pesticides. among them, aldicarb is highly toxic and alkali-resistant, and improper production or use. inadvertent or oral suicide can lead to poisoning. the toxic effect is similar to that of organophosphorus pesticide poisoning, which can cause systemic diseases mainly caused by muscarinic, nicotinic and central nervous system symptoms caused by decreased cholinesterase activity in the body.common varieties of carbamate insecticides are naphthyl carbamates (carbaryl), phenyl carbamates (leaf), heterocyclic dimethyl carbamates (isosone). heterocyclic methyl carbamates (carbofuran), etc., because the pesticides in this class are easily hydrolyzed and inactivated, the toxicity is smaller than that of organophosphorus pesticides, and the recovery is also fast.","no special precautions, early detection, early treatment.","carbamate pesticides can invade the body through the respiratory tract and digestive tract. they can also be slowly absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes. they are mainly distributed in the liver, kidney, fat and muscle tissues. they are rapidly metabolized in the body, and are metabolized by hydrolysis, oxidation and binding. excretion of urine can generally discharge 70% to 80% of the intake in 24 hours. the mechanism of action of carbamate pesticides is similar to that of organophosphorus pesticides, mainly inhibiting the activity of cholinesterase, causing the hydroxyl group of serine at the active center of the enzyme to be carbamoylated, thus losing the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze acetylcholine, carbamate pesticides. it can form a loose complex with cholinesterase without metabolic activation. since the carbamate pesticide is reversible in combination with cholinesterase, it is quickly hydrolyzed in the body, and cholinesterase activity it is easier to recover, so its toxicity is lighter than organophosphorus pesticide poisoning.","['coma', 'breathing inhibition', 'muscarinic symptoms', 'weakness', 'disgusting', 'rogue']",['coma'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
amoebic bowel disease,"entamoeba hertolytica schmidnn (1930), mainly parasitic in the colon, causing amoebic dysentery or amoebic colitis.amoeba is also the most important pathogenic species in the root-footed worm family. under certain conditions, it can be extended to the liver, lung, brain, genitourinary and other parts to form ulcers and abscesses.","for patients and those who carry the capsules, the drinking water must be boiled, do not eat lettuce, and prevent the diet from being contaminated.prevent flies from breeding and killing flies.","the main source of infection is the population of people who continue to receive cysts in the feces, including chronic patients, recovery period and asymptomatic carriers.because the capsule is resistant to the external environment, it can survive for 5 weeks in the feces, such as contaminated water and food, which can spread the disease.patients in the acute phase often discharge a large number of trophozoites, but die rapidly in the external environment, so patients in the acute phase are not included in the main source of infection.human is the main host and storage host for the tissue amoeba.although mites, pigs, dogs, rats, etc. can naturally infect e. histolytica, the source of infection is of little significance.oral infection is the main route of transmission.water pollution causes endemic epidemics. raw and contaminated fruits and vegetables can also cause disease.fly and cockroaches can also play a role in transmission.male homosexuals can be infected by mouth-to-pubic contact. the population is generally susceptible.there is no difference in gender, and there are relatively few chances of babies and children.malnutrition, low immunity and treatment with immunosuppressive agents have many chances of developing diseases.although the antibody titer is high after infection in the population, it has no protective effect, so repeated infection is more common. popular characteristics: the distribution is spread all over the world, with high incidence in tropical and subtropical areas. the infection rate is related to health and living habits.in a few indeveloped countries, the infection rate is estimated to be 50%.in the world, the average infection rate is about 10%. in recent years, cases of acute amoebic dysentery and liver abscess in china are rare, and only some areas are still distributed. pathophysiology (1) pathogenesis: humans ingested foods and drinking water contaminated by cysts, and the cysts that have not been killed after the stomach are advanced to the lower part of the small intestine with food and bowel movements, and are decapulated by trypsin to escape small trophozoites. , parasitic in the intestinal lumen of the colon, when the host becomes an asymptomatic carrier. if the infected insect is invasive, the small trophozoite invades the intestinal wall tissue and transforms the large trophozoite when the body's immunity declines, phagocytizing red blood cells and tissue cells, damaging the intestinal wall and forming lesions. the invasiveness of e. histolytica to the host is through a contact (contact killing) mechanism, which includes continuous processes such as adhesion, enzymatic lysis, cytotoxicity, and phagocytosis. adhesion refers to galactose-specific adhesin, which has ligand-receptor binding to acetylglucosamine and acetylgalactosamine on the target cell membrane, and trophoblast target cells are made within a few seconds after adhesion. lethal effect, the target cells die after 2 minutes. the adhesion of trophozoites causes a significant increase in the concentration of ca2+ in the target cells, which is part of the cause of target cell death. the dissolved tissue contains a large amount of proteolytic enzyme, and the protease dissolves the extracellular matrix to fix the nuclear structure. cysteine proteolytic enzymes degrade the human secretory iga molecule to evade immunity. the amoebic trophozoites in the lysate also have enterotoxin-like activity, and the secreted components can cause diarrhea. serum igg can persist for several years after healing, but the titer is decreasing. the igg and igm antibodies of amoebic patients are only important for immunodiagnosis. but no protection. specific cellular immunity was inhibited, and the ratio of cd4+/cd8+ in blood decreased. it was speculated that th2 was activated in the cd2+ subpopulation, promoting il-10 secretion, negatively regulating cellular immunity, and allowing the worm to escape host immune effector cells. (2) pathological anatomy: the lesion is in the colon, which is more common in the cecum, ascending colon, rectum, sigmoid colon, appendix and ileum. the typical initial lesions are small, scattered superficial erosions, which form more isolated and lighter small abscesses. after rupture, they form marginal irregularities, mucus and trophozoites. the ulcer is from the size of the needle cap to 3-4 cm, which is round or irregular, and the mucosa between the ulcers is normal. when secondary bacterial infection occurs, the mucosa is extensively congested and edematous. if the ulcer continues to deepen, the condition may destroy the submucosal layer to cause large mucosal necrosis and shedding, and if it is deeper and involves the muscular layer and the serosa layer, it may be accompanied by intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation. chronic stage lesions, tissue persecution and repair coexist, intestinal wall hypertrophy or occasionally scarring stenosis, intestinal polyps, meat edema.","['foam-like smelly loose stools', 'diarrhea', 'intestinal bleeding', 'pus is chocolate color...', 'abdominal pain', 'toxemia']",['liver abscess'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(b) pathogenesis the metabolism of galactose is mainly carried out in the liver. defects in any of the enzymes required for galactose metabolism can lead to metabolic disorders of galactose, which directly cause an increase in the concentration of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate in the blood, of which galactose-1- galactosemia caused by a deficiency in uridine transferase (galt) is most common. the galactose-1-phosphate uridine transferase deficiency is caused by gene mutation and is autosomal recessive. the gene of galactose-1-phosphate uridine transferase is located in the short arm p13 region of chromosome 9, in the population. the gene frequency is 1/150, the patients are homozygous, the heterozygotes are generally not affected, the parents of the patient may be homozygous or heterozygous, and the heterozygous parents are carriers of the causative gene, and the galactose-1-phosphate uridine the transferase activity is only 50% of that of normal people. the galactose-1-phosphate uridine transferase deficiency in the body is mainly caused by point mutation of galt. at present, dozens of mutation sites have been found, due to the decrease of enzyme activity, lead to a significant increase in blood galactose-1-phosphate concentration, excessive galactose-1-phosphate accumulated in the brain, liver, renal tubules and other tissues, can interfere with normal metabolism and cause organ damage, in addition, galactose 1-phosphoric acid can also inhibit the activity of phosphoglucose mutase, glucose-6-phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, etc., preventing the decomposition of glycogen into glucose, causing hypoglycemia, galactose-1- increased phosphoric acid leads to normal metabolism of galactose resistance, causing the concentration of galactose in the blood to increase, the metabolism of galactose bypass is increased, and the production of galactitol is also increased. the deposition of galactitol in the crystal causes cataract.","['hypoglycemia', 'lactose intolerance', 'galactosemia', 'diarrhea', 'congenital lactase deficiency', 'nausea', '汕-amino acid urine', 'congenital lactose intolerance subject to ', 'proteinuria']",['ascites'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['supportive treatment', 'diet treatment']"
fulminant liver failure,"fulminant hepatic failure is relative to the time of onset, but it is controversial for a long time to be considered in the fulminant academic community. it is generally considered that the clinical manifestations of severe hepatitis are less than 14 days after onset.it is caused by a large number of hepatocyte necrosis and severe liver function damage caused by various causes, with acute onset, rapid progress and high mortality.early diagnosis and early treatment can reduce the mortality rate.","the prevention of fulminant hepatic failure should firstly start from the cause, actively prevent hepatitis b, and carry out universal hepatitis b vaccination, especially for vaccination of high-risk groups to effectively prevent the onset of hepatitis b and hepatitis d. others such as bacterial infection, drug, and toxicity are the first to terminate the primary damage factors such as effective control of infection, discontinuation of liver damage drugs.","the most common cause in china is viral hepatitis b, sometimes referred to as slow-onset fulminant hepatitis.for other viral hepatitis, bacterial infectious liver damage, drug, toxicity, etc., fulminant hepatitis may also occur. the pathogenesis of this disease has not been fully elucidated, that is, it is believed that the pathogenesis of fhf is mainly primary immune injury, and secondary hepatic microcirculation disorder, with the study of the effects of cytokines (cytokine) on vascular endothelial cells and the microcirculation of the liver the study of the role of disorders in the pathogenesis suggests that the schwartz reaction is associated with the pathogenesis of fhf, a group of biologically active protein mediators that are secreted following lymphokine research, such as tumor necrosis factor (tnf), interleukins. -1 (il-1) and lymphotoxin (lt), among which tnf is a product of endotoxin-stimulated mononuclear macrophages and acts on vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes, leading to schwartz reaction, and thus tnf is considered to be one of the main pathogenesis of fhf, in addition, endotoxemia can increase hepatocyte necrosis and lead to visceral injury (such as renal failure) is also an important pathogenic factor.","['nausea and vomiting', 'intestinal sound disappears', 'weakness', 'continuous fever', 'hiccup', 'nose fan', 'intestinal paralysis', 'poison-induced liver damage']",['hypoglycemia'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive therapy', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
whipworm disease,"trichuriasis is a common intestinal parasitic disease caused by the cecum, appendix and ascending colon of parasitic nematodes (trichuri strichiura), which is widely distributed, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. it is widespread in china, especially in rural areas.the patients are mainly children, severe infection can affect the growth and development of children, mild to moderate infection can be asymptomatic; severe infections include diarrhea, blood in the stool, urgency, rectal prolapse, anemia and malnutrition.","promote the treatment of fecal harmless treatment, strengthen the management of manure, pay attention to environmental sanitation, personal hygiene, and protect water sources.","(1) the cause of the disease: the first-in-line nematode (referred to as whipworm) belongs to the linear animal door, the nematode, the whipworm, and the human being is the only natural host. the front body is 3/5 slender, flesh-colored, and the back end is obese. it is in the shape of a whip. the male is 30 to 45 mm long and the tail is curled to 360～. the reproductive organs include the bag-shaped testicles, the vas deferens, the ejaculatory duct, the cloaca and the spear-like thorn. the female is 35 to 50 mm long. blunt round, genital organs have ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and vulva openings in front of the obesity. the eggs are in the shape of a waist drum, with a mucus plug protruding from the inner layer at both ends, not colored, the egg shell has three layers, the outermost layer is a yolk membrane, which is brown, and the size of the eggs is (50-54) 米m G (22-23) mm, excreted with feces, develops into a contagious period in warm, dark and moist soil, containing an active first-stage larva of the unskinned skin in the egg shell, which is swallowed by the digestive juice and in the small intestine. hatching larvae and drilling into the small intestine and colonic crypts, and finally settled in the cecum and part of the large intestine epithelial cells, no longer moved to other parts, gradually developed into adult worms, about 2 months, adult life in the body 3 to 5 in the year, it is less resistant to dryness and heat than locust eggs; it does not develop into a contagious period in hard soil, dust, cinder, and garbage; it cannot survive under the influence of sunlight, cold, humus and chemicals, in dry manure. it only lives for a few days or weeks. the main mode of transmission is that the eggs in the feces contaminate the soil, and then the infected eggs are directly or indirectly passed through the hands and vegetables to cause infection, and people are not directly infected. (b) the pathogenesis is generally considered to include mechanical and allergic injury, the former may be the main cause of human whipworm disease, adult worms into the cecum and colon epithelium development, causing intestinal mucosal damage, and the insect body stimulated in the intestinal mucosa mucosal plexus causes diarrhea and spasms. diffuse colitis is thought to be related to allergic reactions caused by whipworm infection, with characteristic eosinophils and charcot-ryden crystals in colonic exudates, bawie et al. (1978) based on whipworm disease growth retardation and clubbing occur, suggesting that the worm may be associated with an unknown factor. according to electron microscopic observation, the growth and development of the mouse cecum in the cecum, through the action of the lysed tissue of the head of the worm, enter the intestinal epithelial cells, form a syncytium of the intestinal cells, and swallow the cellular components of the host, when the worm matures when the posterior part of the body protrudes or the tunnel ruptures and hangs in the intestine cavity, it is beneficial to mating and spawning. microscopic examination reveals that the intestinal tissue inflammation is mild, but the intestinal wall cells are destroyed, and the intestinal villi are lost due to fibrillar fibers. shortened, no obvious bleeding around the tunnel, and plasma cells, lymphocytes and eosinophils infiltrated between the crypts. in patients with mild infection, whipworms often parasitize in the cecum and ascending colon; in severe infections, the transverse colon and descending colon may be involved, and even the rectum may have parasitic worms. colonoscopy may reveal edema on the mucosal surface and increased blood vessels; in severe cases, there are mucosal hemorrhage or ulceration, rectal involvement, mucosal edema and hemorrhage, pathological changes only found in the epithelial layer and lamina propria, intestinal wall crypts and intestinal glands hyperplasia, goblet cells normal or hyperplasia, large amount of mucus on the intestinal surface, surface epithelial exfoliation rarely, mononuclear cells are seen in the lamina propria, eosinophil infiltration, severe infection can cause diffuse infiltration of eosinophils, and even deep into the submucosa.","['dysentery', 'diarrhea',  'abdominal pain', 'low fever', 'disgusting']",['hives'],"['surgery', 'anorectal']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

constipation,"constipation is a symptom of many diseases, not a disease.constipation has different meanings for different patients.the common symptom is that the number of defecations is significantly reduced, every 2 to 3 days or more, irregular, dry and hard, often accompanied by pathological phenomena of difficulty in defecation.","daily prevention of constipation 1. there must be an appropriate amount of cellulose in the diet. 2, eat a certain amount of vegetables and fruits every day, eat apples on an empty stomach in the morning and evening, or eat 1-3 bananas before each meal. 3, the staple food should not be too fine, you should eat some coarse grains. 4, in the morning, drink a cup of light salt water or honey water on an empty stomach, with abdominal massage or turn waist, let the water vibrate in the stomach, strengthen the laxative effect. drink plenty of cold water all day long to help the bowels. 5, carry out appropriate physical activity, strengthen physical exercise, such as lying on the back of the leg, squatting up, riding a bicycle, etc. can strengthen the abdominal movement, promote gastrointestinal motility, and help promote bowel movements. 6, every night before going to bed, massage the abdomen, develop the habit of regular bowel movements. 7, to maintain a comfortable mood, life should be regular. constipation health education 1, bowel movements, walking, running, deep breathing exercise, practicing qigong, tai chi, turning waist and lifting legs, participating in cultural activities and physical labor can strengthen gastrointestinal activities, increase appetite, diaphragm, abdominal muscles the anal muscles are exercised; the defecation power is improved, the constipation is prevented, the rural elderly who work frequently are rarely constipated, and the elderly people who are lazy in activities and pampered are more constipated, which explains this truth. 2, because the feces are mainly composed of food after digestion, so it is a simple and easy way to prevent constipation through diet adjustment. first of all, pay attention to the amount of diet, only enough amount is enough to stimulate bowel movements, so that the feces are normal. pass and excrete, especially to eat enough, followed by the quality of the diet, the staple food should not be too fine, should pay attention to eat coarse grains and miscellaneous grains, because coarse grains, grains after digestion, more residue, can increase the amount of stimulation of the intestine, conducive to the operation of stool, non-staple food should pay attention to eat more vegetables containing more cellulose, because normal people need 90-100 mg of cellulose per kilogram of body weight to maintain normal bowel movements, can eat more vegetables, leeks, celery, oysters, etc., because the fiber is not easy digested and absorbed, the amount of residue is increased, the volume in the intestine can be increased, the pressure in the intestine can be increased, the intestinal peristalsis can be increased, and the bowel movement can be increased, which is beneficial to defecation, and it is necessary to drink more water, especially heavy physical laborers, because of sweating, respiratory volume large, water consumption, the water in the intestines must be absorbed in large quantities, so to prevent dry stools, drink plenty of water, drink before breakfast or after getting up. water has a mild laxative effect, enough water to drink, so that the intestines get enough water to facilitate the passage of intestinal contents, and can also intentionally eat more fat-containing foods, such as walnuts, peanuts, sesame seeds, rapeseed oil , peanut oil, etc., they all have a good laxative effect.","(1) anal, painful lesions near the rectum: anal fissure, anal fistula, abscess around the anus, proctitis or rectal ulcer, massive internal hemorrhoids or internal hemorrhoids combined with infection, bleeding and other lesions can cause anal sphincter spasm or patients fear bowel movements, defecation the reflection disappears and leads to constipation. (2) colonic obstructive lesions: intestinal torsion, intestinal adhesions, intussusception, intestinal parasitic diseases, intestinal tumors, mesenteric vascular embolization or thrombosis can cause intestinal obstruction, so that the upper stool of the obstruction cannot pass through the obstruction. it can lead to constipation. (3) intestinal motor reflex inhibition: the normal peristaltic function of the intestine is significantly weakened, which can be seen in visceral inflammatory diseases such as appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, peritonitis, acute secondary megacolon, etc. constipation can also occur due to intestinal paralysis, cholelithiasis, kidney stones and other painful diseases. (4) taking certain drugs: after taking aluminum hydroxide, atropine, oxytetracycline and basic strontium carbonate (barium carbonate), sucralfate and other drugs, some patients may have constipation. (1) organic diseases: 1 chronic colonic obstruction: such as colonic stenosis, benign or malignant colorectal tumors, omental adhesion syndrome (transverse colon is pulled, and forms an acute angle, resulting in difficulty in the passage of contents) and other chronic colonic obstruction sexual disease. 2 congenital megacolon: constipation due to high intestinal lumen expansion, intestinal paralysis, intestinal muscle contraction, peristaltic function disappeared. 3 extra-intestinal lesions, especially the rectum, sigmoid extra-colon lesions, such as pelvic tumors, ovarian cysts, prostate tumors, large tumors or masses in the abdominal cavity, ascites, etc. can compress the intestines. 4 brain and spinal cord lesions: such as myelitis, various types of encephalitis, brain tumors, etc., can cause normal reflex arcs of defecation, resulting in constipation. 5 chronic lead, arsenic, mercury and phosphorus poisoning: poisoning can cause bowel movements to disappear and cause constipation. 6 chronic systemic diseases: such as mucinous edema, hypothyroidism, etc., can disappear due to defecation, slow bowel movements and constipation. (2) functional constipation and constipation-type irritable bowel syndrome (ibs): 1 abdominal muscles, anal muscles or colon smooth muscle and intermuscular plexus dysfunction, often cause debilitating dysmotility and constipation, more common in multiple pregnant women, chronic emphysema, malnutrition, weakness, senile and abdominal viscera drooping. 2 rectal dilatation, contraction of bowel movements is slow or disappear, more common in the failure to develop daily regular bowel habits, at this time because of the feeling of no fecal stimulation, so the normal bowel movements are significantly weakened, patients can lead to intractable constipation over time. 3 if you eat too little diet, or eating habits, changes in diet types, environmental changes and other factors can cause bowel movements to weaken and cause constipation. 4 emotional changes, tension, anxiety and other factors can lead to weakened bowel function, and constipation, but more common with diarrhea, known as irritable bowel syndrome (constipation type), patients often accompanied by abdominal pain or abdominal discomfort. 5 abuse of strong laxatives can lead to normal bowel movements to reduce or disappear, so constipation can also occur, repeated use of strong laxatives will inevitably make constipation more serious, and even cause a vicious circle, even secret - strong laxative - constipation. at present, it is generally believed that there are two types of functional constipation: 1 slow transit constipation, that is, intestinal feces are retained in the colon, can not be discharged according to the normal rhythm, time, 2 functional outlet obstruction type, that is, due to anal sphincter dysfunction or pelvic floor muscle dysfunction and other causes the feces to drain from the rectum and anus. differences in personal physique and environmental impact. the pathogenesis of the food is empty, the ileum is digested and absorbed, and the remaining chyme residue that can no longer be absorbed is discharged from the small intestine to the colon with the peristalsis of the intestine. the colonic mucosa further absorbs water and electrolytes, and the feces are gradually formed in the transverse colon. the sigmoid colon, rectum, and rectal mucosa are mechanically stimulated by fecal filling and expansion, producing sensory impulses. impulsive movement through the pelvic nerve, lumbosacral spinal cord is transmitted to the cerebral cortex, and then the efferent nerve transmits impulse to the rectum, causing contraction of the rectal muscle. the sphincter relaxation, followed by the contraction of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm at the same time, causes the feces to be excreted from the anus. the above is the normal process of defecation reflex. if any obstacle in the reflex process of the bowel movement can cause constipation, the following factors are all occurring. important reasons for constipation: 1. the intake of food or water is too small, so that the amount of chyme residue or feces in the intestine is also small, which is not enough to stimulate the normal peristalsis of the colon. 2. the peristalsis of the intestine is weakened or the muscle tone of the intestine is reduced. 3. there is a stenosis or obstruction in the intestinal lumen, which hinders normal intestinal peristalsis, resulting in feces not being able to descend, such as intestinal obstruction or left colon cancer. 4. constipation can occur when there is any obstacle or lesion in the process of defecation reflex, such as weakened feeling of mechanical stimulation of rectal mucosa, pelvic nerve, lumbosacral spinal neuropathy, anal sphincter spasm, abdominal muscle and diaphragm contraction movement weakening.","['it's bright red blood is dripping...', 'constipation with abdominal mass', 'low feces', 'secondary constipation', 'laxative constipation', 'day stool is abacus-like', 'poop habit change ', 'intestinal paralysis', 'intestinal irritable syndrome', 'tsu lose blood and dryness']",['intestinal obstruction'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatments such as laxatives, prokinetic drugs, chinese medicine treatments']"

(2) toxic substances cause changes in blood components: such as carboxyhemoglobin, degenerative hemoglobinemia, and hemolysis. (3) toxic substances inhibit the body tissues.

barrett's esophagus,"barrett's esophagus is a pathological phenomenon in which the stratified squamous epithelium in the lower esophagus is replaced by a single columnar epithelium. it has no special symptoms. when there is esophagitis, ulceration, and cancer, the corresponding reflux symptoms will appear. esophageal adenocarcinoma may occur in barrett's epithelium (more in the western population).","daily prevention of gastroesophageal reflux is related to diet. excessive intake of foods such as greasy, high-fat, high-protein and crude fiber is an important cause of reflux, eating greasy and hard-to-digest foods, especially long-term. eating this kind of food, the possibility of gastroesophageal reflux is relatively large, in addition to greasy food, sweets are also easy to make people back to acid, heartburn, so try to avoid excessive eating. prevention of gastroesophageal reflux is very important, changing lifestyle is the best way to prevent pantothenic acid, heartburn, try to eat high-fat meals, chocolate, coffee, candy, sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro.","peptic ulcer is often formed on the basis of this lesion because the gastroesophageal reflux destroys the normal squamous epithelium and leads to the formation of a metaplastic columnar epithelium that is more resistant to digestive juice. esophageal stricture, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, until adenocarcinoma.","['disgusting and vomiting', 'post-sternal pain', 'stool blood', 'difficulty swallowing', 'burning heart']",['esophageal stricture'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
atherosclerosis,"esophagealachalasia, also known as sputum sputum, is the number of ganglion cells in the esophageal wall plexus, or even disappears, can affect the entire thoracic esophagus, but the most obvious in the middle and lower part of the esophagus, commonly used names in the domestic literature. there are sputum and achalasia.the main features are the lack of peristalsis of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (les) high pressure and the relaxation response to swallowing action. the clinical manifestations are difficulty in swallowing, food reflux and posterior sternal discomfort or pain. this disease is a rare disease ( it is estimated that only about 1 in 100,000 people) can occur at any age, but most commonly in the age group of 20 to 39 years old, children are rarely ill, and the incidence of men and women is roughly equal, more common in europe and north america, the disease the risk of esophageal cancer is potentially untimely.","eat small meals, eat and chew, avoid overheating and irritating diet, psychological treatment and external agents for people with nervous nervousness, some patients use valsalva action to promote food from the esophagus into the stomach, relieve post-sternal discomfort, sublingual nitroglycerin can relieve esophageal spasm, such as empty esophageal emptying.","the etiology of this disease is still unclear. it is generally believed that this disease is a neurogenic disease. the lesion can be seen in the esophageal wall of the vagus nerve and its dorsal nucleus and the esophageal plexus. the ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus are reduced or even completely absent, but les the reduction within the body is lighter than the esophageal body. as a result, animal experiments have shown that freezing or severing the vagus nerve above the thoracic level (both sides) can cause a lack of peristalsis and poor les relaxation in the lower esophagus, and the vagus nerve below the unilateral or lower thoracic level does not affect the function of the les. it can be seen that the innervation of the vagus nerve only ends in the upper part of the esophagus, while the function of the lower end of the esophagus is dominated by the intermuscular nerve plexus of the esophageal wall. the neurotransmitters are purine nucleotides and vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip). the vip in the les of this patient was 8.5I3.6mol/g, which was significantly lower than that of normal people (95.6I28.6mol/g). vip had the effect of inhibiting the les tension at rest, and the vip in les was significantly reduced. the les loses its inhibitory effect and the tension increases, causing achalasia. some chronic animal models of esophageal achalasia are produced by bilateral cervical vagotomy or by toxins destroying the ganglion cells of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve or the intermuscular nerve plexus of the esophagus. in addition, the trypanosoma of south america invades the esophageal muscle layer. excretion of exotoxin, destruction of the nerve plexus, can lead to les tension and esophageal enlargement (chageas disease), gastric muscle invasion of les myometrial plexus can also cause symptoms similar to this disease, some patients with esophageal achalasia have difficulty swallowing often sudden, and with the vagus nerve and esophageal wall muscle plexus degeneration, it is also believed that the disease may be caused by neurotoxic virus, but has not been confirmed so far, although there have been reports in the literature, in the same family many people suffer from this disease, and occasionally the twins have the same disease, but whether the disease has a genetic background is not certain. it is believed that viral infection, toxins, nutrient deficiencies and local inflammation may be the cause of this disease, but no virus particles are found in the vagus nerve and intramural plexus by electron microscopy. the virus infection theory is not supported. some children have a family history. it suggests that the onset is related to genes. clinical studies have found that mental concerns can aggravate the symptoms of children, and consider whether the cortical neurological dysfunction caused by mental stimulation leads to central and autonomic dysfunction. in recent years, hla dqw antigen and the disease have been discovered. closely related and found in the patient's serum an autoantibody that antagonizes the gastrointestinal nerves, suggesting that the disease has autoimmune factors. pathogenesis: the exact pathogenesis of achalasia is still unclear. the basic defect is neuromuscular abnormality. pathological findings include different degrees of muscular plexus lesions in the esophageal body and the lower esophageal sphincter. auerbach intracranial mononuclear the cells infiltrated into the whole ganglion cells and replaced by fibrous tissue. the vagus nerve has wallerian degeneration. the nerve cells in the dorsal motor nucleus are lost. the esophageal smooth muscle is normal under light microscope, but under the electron microscope, the surface of the microfilament is detached and the cell shrinks. however, it is unclear whether these changes are primary or secondary. in summary, the results of histology, ultrastructural and pharmacological studies indicate that the esophagus of achalasia has been denervated, the lesion is located in the brainstem, vagus nerve fibers, auerbach nerves. plexus and intramuscular nerve fibers, but can not clarify where the primary lesion is, may be diffuse neurodegenerative or neurotoxic substances affecting all nervous systems from the brain to the muscle fibers. the pathophysiological mechanisms of achalasia are as follows: 1. neurogenic lesions: patients with esophageal plexus (auerbach plexus) ganglion cells are reduced, absent, degenerative, neurofibrosis, no pathological changes suggest external sources in neuropathy, the muscle cord in the esophageal body and les area of the patient does not respond to the stimulation of the ganglion level, while the direct action of acetylcholine can cause the contractile response. it is also reported that the patient's esophagus is highly reactive to the cholinergic agent, ie a strong segmental contraction occurs, according to cannon's law, that is, the tissue that loses the autonomic nerve is more sensitive to the neurotransmitter response, indicating that the lesion is mainly in the nerve. 2. inhibitory neuronal involvement: les region nerve excitability (cholinergic) and inhibitory (non-cholinergic non-adrenergic nanc), vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) and nitric oxide (no) it is a nanc-inhibiting neurotransmitter that mediates smooth muscle relaxation. the nerve fibers in the lower esophagus are significantly reduced in patients with achalasia. the abnormal contraction of cholecystokinin (cck) in patients with les also suggests inhibitory nerve damage. the patient's les responds differently to drugs such as opioid peptides, and also suggests abnormalities in nerve or myocyte receptors. 3. abnormal vagus nerve function: the patient with this disease has obvious gastric acid secretion disorder, similar to the symptoms after vagus nerve resection, suggesting that there is vagus nerve dysfunction. in summary, due to vagus central and esophageal wall plexus lesions, inhibitory neurotransmitter deficiency, esophageal denervation atrophy and vagus nerve dysfunction and other factors lead to increased les resting pressure; les relaxation is not complete or can not relax at the time of swallowing the esophageal body is inconsistent with movement and movement, and has no promoting effect on food, so that the food stays in the esophagus. when the internal pressure of the esophagus exceeds the les pressure, a small amount of food can pass slowly due to gravity, and the long-term contents of the esophagus remain. lead to esophageal dilatation, prolongation and flexion, esophageal inflammation, ulceration or canceration. in recent years, some patients have found that some patients have crease contraction after esophagectomy after treatment, so it is considered that the non-peristaltic contraction of the esophageal body is not primary. it is related to les obstruction. the achalasia affects the entire thoracic esophagus and is not confined to the cardia. at the beginning, the esophagus is normal in anatomy, later hypertrophy, dilatation, and loss of normal peristalsis. after the sphincter, the hypertrophy, dilation, and loss of normal peristalsis, the sphincter can not relaxation, abnormality is mainly limited to the inner ring muscle, while the outer longitudinal muscle function is normal, according to the extent of esophageal dilation, light, medium, weight 3 degrees, 1 mild: no obvious expansion or expansion of the esophageal cavity is limited to the esophagus in the lower segment, the diameter of the general lumen is <4

hepatitis c virus,"hepatitis c virus is a group of systemic infectious diseases caused by hepatitis c virus (hcv) and mainly caused by liver damage.it can be caused by blood transfusion or blood products, blood dialysis, apheresis and blood transfusion, kidney transplantation, intravenous drug use, sexual transmission, mother-to-child transmission and other infections.","1. anti-hcv screening of blood donors is an important measure to reduce hepatitis c after transfusion. 2. management of infectious sources: according to patients with hepatitis type, use disposable medical supplies; publicize the knowledge of prevention and treatment of hepatitis c, and abide by the disinfection and isolation system. 3. protection of susceptible population: it has been reported that immunoglobulin is effective in preventing hepatitis c. the usage is 0.06ml/kg, intramuscular injection. the ultimate control of this disease depends on vaccine prevention. hcv molecular cloning is successful, providing vaccine prevention for this disease. the conditions.","(1) causes of the disease hcv is a blood-borne type of hepatitis virus. in 1989, chiron corporation of the united states successfully cloned (hcv) cdna using molecular cloning technology. hcv is the first human virus discovered by molecular biology techniques. hcv belongs to the family of togaviridae. its biological traits and gene structure are similar to those of flavivirus and prion. it has been confirmed that hcv is a spherical particle containing a lipid outer shell with a diameter of 30-60 nm. the hcv genome is a long positive strand. the rna is about 9.5kb long. the hcv genome has a large open reading frame (orf) encoding a 3010 or 3011 amino acid polyprotein. the encoded polyprotein body and the flavivirus have obvious common structure: containing structural proteins (including cores). protein and envelope proteins) and non-structural proteins (ns1-ns5). hcv is an rna virus, which is relatively easy to mutate. only 68.1% to 91.8% of the nucleotides in different regions are identical. according to the difference in hcv gene sequence, they can be divided into different genotypes. currently, there is no uniform standard for hcv genotyping. methods, okamoto divided hcv into four genotypes i, ii, iii and iv. according to its classification, most of north america, european hcv strains belong to type i, japan mainly type ii, and also have type iii and type iv. according to wang yu, the northern cities are mainly type ii and type iii, while in southern cities, more than 90% are type ii. (two) pathogenesis 1. direct pathogenic effects of hcv infection many studies have shown that the severity of liver tissue inflammation in hcv-infected patients is related to viremia. the severity of liver tissue inflammation in patients with chronic hepatitis c is related to the level of hcv rna in hepatocytes. the correlation of hcv rna levels is stronger. after treatment with interferon, serum alt levels are gradually decreased with the decrease of serum hcv rna content. the above results suggest that hcv may have direct pathogenic effects. however, immunohistochemical study the expression of hcv antigen in liver tissue has not been fully proved to be related to the inflammatory activity of liver disease. groff et al. found that the presence of hcv antigen in hepatocytes does not necessarily indicate the presence of hepatocytes. hcv granules, liver disease inflammatory activities are not necessarily related to hcv antigen expression in hepatocytes. related, and liver tissue inflammation is related to the presence of hcv virions in hepatocytes. it also indicates that hcv has direct cytopathic effects. the direct pathogenic effect of hcv may presumably replicate with hcv in hepatocytes, causing changes in liver cell structure and function. , or interfere with liver cell protein synthesis caused by hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis, the presence of hcv asymptomatic carrier status it seems to suggest that hcv has no direct pathogenic effect, but recently reported that most of the ""chronic hcv carriers"" liver tissues with normal alt persisted in different degrees of lesions and inflammation, and the degree of liver tissue inflammation damage is related to hcv replication level, indicating that there is no the state of symptoms is less common and further supports the direct pathogenic role of hcv. 2. cell-mediated immune damage may be the main cause of liver disease caused by hcv. one of the important features of hepatitis c liver histopathology is the accumulation of lymphocytes in the portal area, sometimes forming lymphoid follicles. hepatitis is obvious, lymphocyte infiltration is undoubtedly related to immune response. some scholars have proved that the lymphocytes infiltrated in chronic hepatitis c are mainly cd8+ cells, many of which have active epitopes, which are shown to be activated, and lymphocytes are observed under electron microscope. the cells are in close contact with the liver cells, suggesting that it has toxic damage to the liver cells. mondelli et al. have confirmed that the toxicity of chronic non-a, non-b hepatitis cytotoxic t cells on autologous hepatocytes is increased in chronic hepatitis c and cytotoxicity. mainly caused by t cells, on the contrary, in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, immune effector cells are limited to non-t lymphocytes. in chronic hbv infection, non-t and t lymphocytes are involved in hepatocyte injury, and hcv-specific antigens can activate cd8+. and cd56+ cells suggest that cd56+ cells also play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis c, chronic hepatitis c intrahepatic t cells can recognize the c protein of hcv, multiple antigenic determinants of e1 and e2/ns1 proteins, and this recognition is restricted by hla-i, which also indicates that tc cells play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis c. other studies have shown that most of the chronic hcv-infected patients with peripheral blood and liver tissue restricted by hla-ii molecules cd4+ cells (th-1 cells) can attack hcv-specific immune antigenic determinants, cd4+ cells to hcv core antigen the response is related to hepatic inflammatory activity. th-1 cells play a key role in chronic hepatitis c. hcv-specific th cell surface antigenic determinants enhance the specific response of tc cells to hcv antigen, suggesting that th cells can assist and enhance tc. cell attack destroys hcv-infected hepatocytes. the e1 and e2/ns of hcv rna are hypervariable regions, which are easily mutated in vivo and can cause changes in the target antigen (e1, e2/ns protein) of the hepatocyte membrane of hcv-infected patients, and tc cells will be recognized again. emerging epitopes and attack damage to liver cells, which is the higher the hcv rna mutation rate, the more serious the liver tissue inflammation, also indicates that the immune-mediated mechanism plays an important role in liver cell damage in chronic hcv-infected patients. 3. autoimmune hcv infection is often accompanied by the following characteristics: 1 non-specific immune disorders, such as mixed condensed globulinemia, sjogren's syndrome and thyroiditis. 2 non-specific autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody, can be detected in serum. 3 part of type ii autoimmune hepatitis [anti-liver kidney microsomal type i antibody (anti-c-lkm-1 antibody) positive] may be anti-hcv positive. 4 anti-gor may occur; 5 liver histological changes are similar to autoimmune liver disease, so it is speculated that the pathogenesis of hcv infection may involve autoimmune factors, but anti-hcv, anti-lkm-1 and anti-gor the relationship, its pathogenic significance, etc. are for further study. 4. significance of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of hepatitis c apoptosis is mediated by fas antigen on the surface of cell membrane. hiramatsu et al. confirmed that fas antigen is not expressed in normal liver tissue. when infected with hcv, fas antigen is more common in liver tissues with active lesions, especially around the portal area, the expression of fas antigen in hcv-infected patients is closely related to liver tissue necrosis and inflammation, and the expression of hcv core antigen in hepatocytes, indicating that fas-mediated apoptosis is hcv. one of the forms of infection with hepatocytes. the pathogenesis of hcv infection is complex, and many factors and their interrelationships need further study and clarification. compared with other types of hepatitis, hepatitis c has its characteristic pathological changes, mainly the following: 1 lymphocyte cluster accumulation in the portal area and poulsen-christoffersen type cholangitis (biliary epithelial cell degeneration, surrounded by a large number of lymphocytic infiltration ) is an important feature and has diagnostic value. 2 early cases showed sinusoidal cell infiltration, but did not affect the liver cells around the sinus is the important difference between acute hepatitis b. 3 hepatocyte necrosis is lighter, the range is limited, and it appears later. 4 sinus and hepatocyte interstitial fibrosis is more obvious than hepatitis b, and appears earlier, which may be one of the reasons for the development of cirrhosis. 5 hepatocyte steatosis is more common, fat vacuoles can be macrobubble or vesicular. 6 hepatocyte eosinophilic changes are flaky and appear in the non-inflammatory response zone.","['hepatic lesions diffuse', 'hbv and hcv...', 'hepatic function tests bilirubin...', 'hepatic membrane tension', 'large and hard', 'hepatic pain']",['cirrhosis'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']",['medical treatement']

intestinal flora disorder,"a healthy person has a wide variety of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. these microorganisms are called intestinal flora.the intestinal flora is combined in a certain proportion, and the bacteria are mutually restricted and interdependent, forming a dynamic balance in quality and quantity. once this balance is broken in some cases, the intestinal flora is dysfunctional ( intestinal dysbacteriosis (id), which manifests itself in changes in the gut flora in terms of species, quantity, proportion, location, and biological characteristics.clinically, there are many causes and diseases that cause intestinal flora imbalance, often causing each other.in particular, long-term application of broad-spectrum antibiotics, sensitive intestinal bacteria are inhibited, and uninhibited bacteria multiply and multiply, causing dysbacteriosis, normal physiological combination is destroyed, and pathological combination is produced, causing clinical symptoms called intestinal alteration of intestinaflora.the incidence of this disease is about 2% to 3%.","1. actively treat the primary disease and correct possible predisposing factors such as treating various intestinal infectious diseases, metabolic syndrome, knot hoof tissue diseases, improving chronic diseases with impaired liver and kidney function, avoiding abuse of antibiotics, and treating the elderly for those with weak or chronic wasting diseases, when using antibiotics or hormones, strict indications should be made. it is best to use drug sensitivity tests and select the most sensitive antibiotics.for those who are old, thin, and infirm, use antibiotics together with lactobacillus or bifidobacterium live bacteria preparations and vitamin b or vitamin c.to protect the normal flora of the intestines.handling all kinds of trauma and perioperative treatment work, not curing the primary disease, it is difficult to prevent the occurrence of intestinal flora imbalance, and it is not easy to correct after the occurrence. 2. adjusting the body's immune function and malnutrition status the healthy organism's native bacteria can prevent the invasion of foreign bacteria, but in the case of hunger, malnutrition, and low immune function, it creates conditions for the occurrence of intestinal flora imbalance. nutritional support and improvement of the body's immunity have positive implications for the prevention of this disease.","dietary factors (25%): the results of the study of bacterial enzymes to study the metabolic activity of the flora showed that the diet can significantly change the fecal flora, the fiber-free food can promote bacterial translocation, and spaethg is used for experimental research. the results showed that dietary fiber can maintain the normal ecological balance of intestinal flora, and the end product of bacterial metabolic fiber has a nutritive effect on intestinal epithelium. fiber can maintain the normal metabolism and cell dynamics of intestinal mucosa cells. hosoda et al reported the addition of low slag of fiber. diet has a good effect on preserving the structure and function of the intestine. whether the protective effect of fiber directly stimulates the intestinal mucosa or induces the release of nutritive gastrointestinal hormones is not clear. dietary fiber can reduce bacterial translocation, but can not restore barrier function. to normal. factors that change the flora (20%): the composition of the flora can vary from individual to individual, but for the same person, the composition of the flora is very stable over a long period of time, and the ecological status of each species is determined by the host. the physiological state, the interaction between bacteria and the influence of the environment are determined. under the equilibrium state, all ecological status is occupied, and the temporary habitat of bacteria can change the ecological balance. metabolic factors of drugs (18%): intestinal flora plays an important role in the metabolism of many drugs, including lactulose, sulfasalazine salicylate, levodopa, etc. any antibiotic can cause changes in colonic flora. depending on the antibacterial spectrum of the drug and its concentration in the intestinal lumen, clindamycin and ampicillin can cause an ecological vacuum in the large intestine, proliferating c. difficile, and applying h2 receptors such as cimetidine. antagonists can cause drug-induced low gastric acid and gastric bacterial proliferation. age factor (15%): as the age increases, the balance of the intestinal flora can change, the double-tailed bacteria decrease, and the production of clostridium perfringens increases. the former may weaken the stimulation of immune function, and the latter lead to an increase in toxins. immunization is inhibited, and the elderly may be able to improve their immunity if they can maintain the balance of the intestinal flora during youth. gastrointestinal immune dysfunction factors (10%): the normal immune function of the gastrointestinal tract comes from the plasma cells of the lamina propria. the plasma cells can produce a large amount of immunoglobulin, the secretory iga, which is the main substance that prevents the invasion of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. once the gastrointestinal mucosa synthesizes monomers, or double-body iga, or the function of synthetic secretory tablets, resulting in the lack of typing iga in the gastrointestinal secretions, can cause over-reproduction of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine, resulting in dysbacteriosis, causing chronic diarrhea, no in patients with iga deficiency, the intestinal flora can also overproduce, and the incidence of dysbacteriosis in the neonatal period is high, which may be related to the immature or imperfect development of the immune system. (1) excessive growth of bacteria: anatomical and physiological abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to the proliferation of colonic plexus in the proximal small intestine, and various metabolic disorders, including steatorrhea, vitamin deficiency and carbohydrate malabsorption, may occur in the small intestine pseudo-obstruction, scleroderma, diabetic autonomic neuropathy, chronic malnutrition, etc., bacterial growth in the small intestine, a variety of anaerobic bacteria (mainly bacteroides, bifidobacterium, veillonococcus, enterococcus and clostridium can hydrolyze and bind bile salts, leading to microcapsule formation disorders, cirrhosis, low acidosis without obvious metabolic disorders, etc. changes in colonic flora can lead to d with neurological insufficiency after extensive small bowel resection - lactic acidosis, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially clindamycin and ampicillin can proliferate c. difficile, produce a proteinmycin, causing colonic mucosal necrosis and ulcers, known as pseudomembranous colitis. (2) bacterial production of iga-degrading enzymes: hemolytic streptococcus, green streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, meningococcus, gonococcus, etc. can produce proteases that decompose iga, and can decompose humans iga1 in serum and secretory iga in colostrum, of which the first 2 bacteria are the main species that constitute the oral flora, and the latter 4 are the virulence pathogens that adhere to the mucosal surface. it can be seen that iga protease is essential for the survival or pathogenesis of these bacteria on the mucosal surface as a resident microorganism. (3) intestinal plexus and tuberculosis: the colonic flora produces a variety of metabolically active enzymes that mediate the reaction of some natural products, food preservatives, dyes, additives and pollutants into mutagenic substances, many bacteria the activity of the bacterial enzyme system can be increased due to prolonged exposure to the substrate. if the substrate is a procarcinogen, prolonged exposure can increase the production of carcinogens.","['blood pressure drop', 'abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting', 'diarrhea', 'lean stool', 'fungal infection', 'indigestion', 'abdominal pain', 'belly sound', 'fecal sour smell']",['diabetes'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']",['medical treatement']

crude cottonseed oil poisoning,"cottonseed, also known as kapok, cotton nucleus, is the seed of the mallow plant cotton grass.cottonseed oil is a fatty oil extracted from cottonseed. cottonseed oil contains linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid and cottonseed pigment gland, which is one of the edible oils of cotton farmers.the pigment glands in cottonseed are mainly phenolic pigments of cottonseed, which can cause damage to organs, cells such as nerves, blood, liver and kidney.mistaken cottonseed, cottonseed cake, large amount or long-term consumption of unrefined cottonseed oil (containing gossypol higher than national standards) can cause gossypolpoisoning, clinical manifestations and consumption of acute poisoning the method is related to the dosage. chronic poisoning may have dry and flushed skin, which is more obvious after sun exposure. women may have amenorrhea, and men have sperm reduction or deficiency.patients are more common in cotton-producing areas.","daily prevention and publicity cottonseed is toxic, can not eat, crude cottonseed oil can be eaten after alkali treatment, cottonseed cake can be used as animal feed after three times of exposure or fermentation, commercially available cottonseed oil and cottonseed cake the free gossypol should be below 0.02% and should not exceed 0.05%.","the disease is caused by the consumption of crude cottonseed oil that has not been properly treated or the cotton cake after oil extraction.gossypol is a toxic substance that can cause redness and hemorrhage, loss of appetite, nervous disorders, weight loss, and affect fertility.consumption of cotton wool containing more gossypol can cause poisoning, and the patient's skin has a strong burning sensation accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness, wheezing, palpitation and weakness.therefore, untreated cotton wool is not edible.","['coma', 'sleepiness', 'appetite loss', 'abdominal pain', 'dizziness', 'disgusting', 'itching', 'liver enlargement', 'convulsions']",['respiratory failure'],['emergency department'],['sympathetic supportive treatment']
enteral torsion,"intestinal torsion is a period of intestinal fistula rotating along the long axis of the mesentery or two segments of intestinal fistula twisted into a knot resulting in closed bowel obstruction, the former is usually acute complete intestinal obstruction.often because the intestinal fistula and its mesentery are too long, the intestinal lumen is compressed and narrowed after the torsion, causing obstruction, torsion and compression, affecting the blood supply to the intestine. therefore, the intestinal obstruction caused by intestinal torsion is mostly strangulated. .intestinal torsion has general intestinal obstruction symptoms, but the onset is rapid, the pain is severe, the patient is restless, shock can occur early, and the intestinal torsion is more common in a clockwise direction. the degree of torsion is less than 360～, and severe cases can reach 2 to 3 turn, the symptoms are slightly different due to the small intestine or sigmoid torsion.","intestinal torsion is a period of intestinal fistula rotating along the long axis of the mesentery or two segments of the intestines twisting into a knot and causing obstructive intestinal obstruction. the former patients have paroxysmal severe cramps in the lower abdomen, abdominal distension, defecation exhaust stops, after the middle it can cause nausea and vomiting, vomit is gastrointestinal contents, pay attention to fasting, gastrointestinal decompression, maintain water and electrolyte balance, anti-infection, and maintain nutrition. avoid heavy physical labor immediately after a full meal, especially the labor that requires the body to lean forward and rotate, which has certain significance for preventing intestinal twist.","the occurrence of volvulus is seen in a variety of reasons. the anatomical factors are the prerequisites for torsion, and the physiological or pathological factors are the predisposing factors. there are three important factors for the reversal of intestinal fistula: weight: such as intestinal fistula the weight of the body itself is increased, and the relationship between gravity is easy to cause the torsion to occur. it is not easy to reset itself after twisting. therefore, the clinical torsion is common in the full meal, the fiber residue in the food is more, the constipation, the intestine cavity has the aphid mass, and the intestinal wall there are large tumors, congenital megacolon and so on. external force promotion: strong bowel movements and sudden changes in body position, such as the sudden rotation of the body and bending hard, can also promote the occurrence of intestinal torsion, and therefore, avoid heavy physical labor immediately after a full meal, especially the need for the body to lean forward and rotate labor. length: the length of the intestinal fistula and its mesentery is relatively longer than the distance between the roots of the two ends of the intestinal fistula, that is, the twist is easy to occur.","['shock', 'intestinal', 'abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting', 'constipation with severe abdominal pain', 'fecal impaction', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation', 'fecal vomit', 'disgusting', 'intussusception']",['intestinal obstruction'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
intussusception,"intussusception refers to the insertion of a segment of the intestine into the lumen of the intestine and causes the contents of the intestine to pass through the barrier.intussusception accounts for 15% to 20% of intestinal obstruction, and there are two types of primary and secondary.primary intussusception occurs mostly in infants and young children. secondary intussusception is more common in adults. the largest intussusception is the insertion of the proximal intestine into the distal intestine. the reverse intussusception is rare and inferior to the total. 10% of the number of cases.","1, usually to avoid cold in the abdomen of children, timely add clothing, to prevent intestinal dysfunction caused by climate change. 2, to prevent infection in the intestines, pay attention to breastfeeding health, prevent disease from the mouth. 3, do not suddenly change the diet structure of children, add complementary food should be gradual. 4, do not give children arbitrarily abuse of anthelmintic drugs, to avoid all kinds of factors that induce abnormal intestinal peristalsis.","according to the site of intussusception, there are no obvious organic lesions, which are divided into primary intussusception and secondary intussusception. secondary intussusception is more common in tumor, trauma and postoperative and intestine inflammatory lesions of the tract. there is no obvious organic factor in the intussusception of the intestine and its vicinity, accounting for 75% to 90% of the number of intussusceptions in children, and only 10% to 15% of adults are primary, and the incidence of intussusception in infants the age is more than 1 year old, and the incidence of infants is the highest in 5-9 months, and gradually decreases in 2 years and older. it occurs mostly in the seasons with large climate change, especially in spring and autumn, and there are more viral infections in the upper respiratory tract and lymph nodes in this season. may cause bowel movements to lose normal rhythm, or form sputum, in addition, sudden changes in the food properties of infants and young children, food allergies, diarrhea, etc. may become the triggering factors of intussusception, the neonatal ileocecal mesentery is often not fixed generally, it should be gradually fixed to the posterior abdominal wall within a few years after birth; because the mesangium is too long and slack, causing the ileocecal part to swim too much, it is the main anatomical factor of the intussusception of this part. it is the most common cause of intussusception in adults. intestinal polyps, leiomyoma, lipoma, fibroids and cancer can cause secondary intussusception. this is because the ileocecal or other intestines are present. the presence of tumors often leads to intestinal peristalsis, which becomes the trap of intussusception. felix analyzed 1214 intussusceptions and 668 cases of small intussusception, of which 383 (57%) were tumors and 116 (30%) were malignant. of the 546 cases of colonic intussusing, 379 (69.4%) were tumors, of which 261 (69%) were malignant, nagomey had 2/3 colon intussusception and 1/3 intussusception as cancer, and the latter 70% metastatic cancer, small intussusception with villous adenoma, lipoma, leiomyoma and various polyps including bentzjeghers syndrome and other benign lesions are more common, duodenal benign tumors caused by intussusception is rare, orenstein has reported 1 case duodenal jejunum intubation complicated with pancreatitis caused by villous adenoma, jennings also reported a case of lipoma caused by duodenal intussusception. abdominal trauma and reports of intussusception after surgery are increasing. duncan has 586 cases of laparotomy due to abdominal trauma, and 21 cases have postoperative intestinal obstruction. 6 cases (28.6%) are intussusception. it is worth noting that 6 cases had no small intestine injury, but most of them were accompanied by shock and liver damage. the second hospital of xianyang city had treated a small intestine injury caused by a sharp instrument. after laparotomy, it was rare to form a multi-site intussusception adjacent to the intestine. intestinal intussusception after abdominal surgery is common in partial gastrectomy, after type ii or roux-y gastrojejunostomy, in the treatment of obesity empty short circuit shunt and various intestinal fistula.cooperman reported that the stump of the appendectomy after appendectomy occurred more than 2 weeks after surgery, and there were symptoms until 6 years after surgery. the cause of intussusception after trauma or abdominal surgery is still unclear. it is speculated that it may be related to intestinal wall hematoma. , edema, adhesions, intestinal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance, intestinal lumen and chronic intestinal dilatation, intestinal anastomosis is associated with poor positioning, abdominal trauma and postoperative small intussusception. intestinal inflammation causes bowel movement disorder, mainly localized ileitis, non-specific ileocecal ulcer, acute ileocecal valve inflammation, acute and chronic appendicitis, etc. in addition, intestinal tuberculosis, bacillary typhoid or typhoid ulcer can cause intussusception congenital malformations such as meckel diverticulum, cecal absence, ileum colonic line connection and intestinal ascariasis, intestinal balloon swelling, idiopathic purpura intestinal wall hematoma are rare causes of secondary intussusception.","['shock', 'emergency abdominal', 'intestinal dysfunction', 'sudden pain', 'peritoneal irritation', 'blood blood', 'upper abdominal pain', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation with severe abdominal pain', 'blood disorders']",['shock'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
inter-abdominal abscess,"intestinal abscess refers to the accumulation of pus in the abdominal cavity, surrounded by adhesions such as intestinal fistula, viscera, intestinal wall, omentum or mesentery, and isolated from the free abdominal cavity to form an abdominal abscess.abdominal abscess can be divided into subarachnoid abscess, pelvic abscess, intestinal gap abscess.generally secondary to acute peritonitis or intra-abdominal surgery, primary infections are rare.","note: 1. patients with peritonitis should take a semi-sitting position to drain the peritoneal exudate to the pelvic cavity. 2. abdominal trauma, should be thoroughly flushed abdominal cavity, as much as possible to absorb abdominal peritoneal exudate, pus and rinse, etc., after surgery is stable, should be used in the early half-sitting position. the disease is mainly caused by abdominal infection or leakage of the digestive tract surrounded by the intestine, mesentery, abdominal wall and omentum, forming single or multiple abscesses of different sizes.therefore, the key to prevention of this disease is active treatment of peritoneal inflammation.","the pus is enclosed in the intestine, between the mesentery and the omentum, and can form single or multiple abscesses of varying sizes. due to the extensive adhesion around the abscess, there are often varying degrees of adhesive intestinal obstruction, such as abscess penetration. intestinal or bladder, the internal hemorrhoids are formed, and the pus is discharged with the urine.","['weakness', 'abdominal tenderness', 'gut sound', 'tension', 'abdominal pain', 'low fever', 'wasting', 'abscess', 'peritonitis']",['intestinal obstruction'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
residual gastric cancer,"gastric gastric cancer (cancerofgastricremnant) is also known as gastric cancer after gastric surgery, because it can occur in the residual stomach after major gastrectomy, can also occur in simple gastrointestinal anastomosis, simple perforation repair or vagus nerve cut in the whole stomach, generally it is considered that it should be limited to gastric cancer that occurs after surgery for gastric non-cancerous lesions. if the operation is due to malignant lesions, it should refer to gastric cancer that occurs more than 20 years after surgery. the predilection site of residual gastric cancer is anastomotic, but it can also be diffuse. throughout the stomach. the incidence of residual gastric cancer may be related to postoperative gastric environment changes and alkaline duodenal fluid reflux.gastric acid deficiency after gastric resection and reflux of alkaline duodenal juice, so that the stomach is in a low acid state, is conducive to bacterial reproduction, may provide suitable growth conditions for bacteria that produce nitrosamine carcinogens.on the other hand, long-term stimulation of alkaline duodenal reflux such as bile can destroy the gastric mucosal barrier, aggravate the occurrence of chronic gastritis and atrophic gastritis, and cause local intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer.due to the damage of the gastric mucosal barrier, carcinogens can directly contact the gastric mucosa, thereby promoting the occurrence of cancer. residual gastric cancer has symptoms similar to those of gastric cancer. after years of peptic ulcer surgery, there are irregular pain, fullness discomfort, loss of appetite, fatigue, weight loss, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia symptoms. the possibility of gastric cancer. the diagnosis of residual gastric cancer can be done as ""tumor markers and liver function tests, barium meal examination, gastroscopy, b-ultrasound examination. once the residual gastric cancer is diagnosed, combined with clinical surgery, surgical resection as soon as possible combined with traditional chinese medicine can achieve good results. when found when there is a shift, it is generally not suitable for surgery. traditional chinese medicine can be used to improve the quality of life and prolong the survival period.","residual gastric cancer is also called postoperative gastric cancer, and the main site is the residual stomach after gastric resection. there are many kinds of harms to gastric cancer, which will affect people's health and cause more serious consequences. therefore, it is necessary to prevent residual gastric cancer at an early stage. preventive methods for residual gastric cancer: 1. strictly grasp the indications for benign gastric resection, standardize operation, and avoid the lack of resection: in the past, the idea that early gastric resection can prevent malignant transformation of peptic ulcer should be abandoned, and patients with benign gastric diseases who can be elective surgery, it is more appropriate to consider surgery after the age of 45. ulcers, especially duodenal bulb ulcers, should be removed from the stomach by less than 60% to ensure the purpose of surgical acid reduction. 2, gastrointestinal reconstruction to avoid duodenogastric reflux: based on billroth-ii gastric surgery, the reflux rate is almost 100%, billroth-i type up to 23%, gastrointestinal reconstruction after gastric surgery should avoid the above surgery in the case, try to use roux-en-y or billroth-ii+braun gastrojejunostomy or directly select high-selective vagotomy to reduce or avoid duodenogastric reflux and reduce the possibility of residual gastric cancer. 3, proficient in matching skills: gastrointestinal reconstruction, anastomosis, to improve the technique of anastomosis, avoid overlapping of tissue levels, reduce the formation of scar tissue; use absorbable suture instead of non-absorbent suture, eliminate the residual stimulation of non-absorbed suture to reduce the risk of residual gastric cancer. 4, eradication of hp: experts said that epidemiological data support hp infection and chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia have a certain etiology, hp is currently considered to be a definite carcinogenic factor, but also gastric mucosa cancer the fuse, so eradication of hp can significantly reduce the infiltration of mucosal inflammatory cells, a certain preventive effect on the occurrence of residual gastric cancer. 5, regular gastroscopy: the longer the postoperative resection of the stomach, the higher the incidence of residual gastric cancer, therefore, regular gastroscopy is of great significance, early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of residual gastric cancer.","after partial gastrectomy or vagus nerve ablation, the stomach is in a low acid or acid-free state. the secretion of gastrin decreases, the protective mucus is reduced, the gastric mucosa gradually shrinks, and the bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal fluid reflux after gastric surgery are more damaged. gastric mucosa, the formation of chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, is an important cause of residual gastric cancer. it is beneficial to the growth and reproduction of bacteria in the stomach, the metabolic products of bacterial toxins and bile being decomposed by bacteria, and can promote cancer, while the bacteria containing nitrate reductase can promote the synthesis of carcinogenic nitrosamines. under the action of cancer-promoting substances, the gastric mucosa may become cancerous. even the stimulation that does not absorb sutures may be one of the factors that cause gastric cancer.in short, gastric surgery changes the normal anatomy and physiological function of the stomach, making the stomach more exposed to carcinogens, under the action of cancer-promoting substances, when the body's immune function is low, residual gastric cancer can occur.","['advanced gastrointestinal symptoms of cancer', 'stomach reduction', 'black stool', 'anemic appearance', 'poor appetite', 'sustained pain', 'black stool with blood' ]",['anemia'],"['oncology', 'tumor surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
residual sinus syndrome,"residualantralsyndrome refers to incomplete antral resection of the sinus surgery during the billroch ii procedure. the residual gastric mucosa is stimulated by refluxing duodenal juice to produce a large amount of gastrin, which acts on parietal cells and makes the gastric acid concentration too high. caused by the syndrome.",the preventive measures of this disease are mainly to avoid the residual of gastric antrum mucosa during the bishop ii operation.,"the gastric antrum mucosa can exceed the pyloric sphincter by 0.5 cm.in the case of bi-type ii gastrectomy, if the distal end of the stomach is not resected, the gastric antrum mucosa remains in the closed end of the duodenum, and the mucosa of the residual gastric antrum is stimulated by the refluxing alkaline duodenal juice to produce a large amount. gastrin, absorbed into the blood, acts on the mucous membrane of the bottom of the stomach, stimulates the parietal cells of the stomach, promotes excessive secretion of gastric juice, hyperacidity, and causes postoperative anastomotic ulcer in about 40% of cases.","['upper abdominal pain', 'excessive stomach acidity', 'heartburn', 'belch']",['recurrent ulcer'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
irritable bowel syndrome,"irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) refers to a group of clinical syndromes including abdominal pain, bloating, changes in bowel habits, abnormal stool characteristics, mucus stools, etc., persistent or recurrent, which can be caused by examination. organic disease.this disease is the most common type of functional bowel disease.","first, often relax, take more deep breaths, go out and divert attention. second, pay attention to life and diet, eat less irritating substances, avoid cold and other bad stimuli. third, take some skin care products and foods that are more effective in adjusting the intestinal flora.","(1) causes of the disease the cause of ibs is not clear, and it is currently considered to be related to the following factors. 1. mental and neurological factors: the incidence of mental and psychological abnormalities in patients with ibs is significantly higher than that of ordinary people. studies have shown that mental stress can change the mmc of the intestines. mental stimulation is more likely to cause intestinal dysfunction in ibs patients than normal people. modern nerves physiology suggests that the intestinal tract of ibs patients is more sensitive to tension and multiple stimuli, but this is due to abnormalities in the intestinal plexus and its receptor or afferent nerve pathway, or abnormal regulation of the intestinal tract by the central nervous system. it is still unclear. other studies have found that stress can cause functional colonic motility disorder in rats, and it is found that the release of some gastrointestinal hormones increases after stress, indicating that the regulation of neuroendocrine is involved in the process of intestinal dysfunction caused by stress. the above spirit, the relationship between neurological factors and ibs, supports the current view that ibs is a gastrointestinal disease of physical and mental diseases. 2. intestinal stimulating factors: certain factors in the intestine may change intestinal function and aggravate the original irritable bowel syndrome. these stimulating factors include external food, drugs, microorganisms, etc., and may also include some some internal substances, experiments have found that the intestinal mucosa of the sensitized antigen in the cavity can significantly induce intestinal contractile activity and diarrhea in the mouse. some analysts believe that when some stimulants act on the intestinal tract multiple times, the intestinal tract may be changed. sensation of motor function and sensitivity to stimuli, resulting in ""susceptibility"" of the intestine, it has been reported that ibs patients with ileum are very sensitive to the secretion of bile acid, but may not be diagnosed as bile acid malabsorption, short-chain or medium-chain fatty acids may reach the right colon in patients with limited absorption capacity or rapid operation in the small intestine, causing rapid pressure waves in the right colon, which are highly effective in advancing colonic contents and may cause pain and diarrhea, whether these intestinal irritants are an inducement or cause in ibs is currently undecided. (two) pathogenesis 1. intestinal movement abnormality: the main pathogenesis of ibs is abnormal intestinal motility. some studies have found that patients with ibs have increased stenotic clustered constrictions (dccs) and prolonged proliferative constrictions (ppcs). consistent with spastic pain, diarrhea-type ibs patients have increased migrating motor complex (mmc) times and shortened cycles; more jejunum contractions in stage ii and after meals; colons show a lot of rapid contraction and propellant contraction; the proximal colon rapidly passes and is positively correlated with the weight of the stool; cholinergic stimulation reduces the sigmoid colon multiple motility index. on the contrary, the proximal colonic transit time of constipation type ibs patients is prolonged, and the emptying is significantly reduced. slow; high propensity to reduce contraction; lowering, sigmoid colon shrinkage frequency and contraction time under basal state, decreased reactivity to cholinergic stimulation, while the percentage of proximal colonic contraction time increased significantly, as inconsistent, the pressure in the anal canal is increased, and the anal sphincter is slow to respond to rectal dilation. then when abnormal external sphincter contraction and bowel problems related to ibs patients. the abnormality of ibs is not limited to the motility disorder of the intestine, esophagus, stomach and biliary tract, so it is called ※asthma of gut§. at present, the results of ibs kinetics are not completely consistent, and some even get the opposite result shows that the dynamic disturbance of ibs is very complicated. it is not only an abnormality of the power of a certain intestine, but there is a problem of coordination between them. 2. paresthesia: ibs patients have lower abdominal pain threshold than normal people, so they have excessive sensation of standard colonic expansion. the synergistic effect of this paresthesia and cluster motor abnormality is the main factor of spastic pain in ibs patients. anxiety aggravates the painful feeling of colon expansion in patients. on the contrary, the perception of intestinal dilatation is reduced in the relaxed state. the abnormal rectal anal sensation causes the feeling of defecation, and even the abdominal pain before defecation, and the excessive feeling of the rectum and the rectum is excessive. the reflex movement is accompanied by an increase in the motor response, which results in an increase in the frequency of defecation, but not an increase in the weight of the defecation. 3. abnormal secretion: in the small intestine mucosa of ibs patients, the secretion of stimulating substances is enhanced, and mucus secretion is increased in the colon mucosa.","['flatness', 'abdominal discomfort', 'diarrhea', 'constipation with severe abdominal pain', 'mucus stool', 'abdominal pain', 'navel pain', 'constipation', 'abnormal fecal discharge process', 'intestine flatulence ']",['gastrointestinal dysfunction'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
intestinal obstruction,"intestinalobstruction (ileus) refers to intestinal contents that are caused by various causes to pass through the intestinal tract.for the common acute abdomen of surgery, sometimes it is difficult to diagnose, and if it is not treated in time, it is often life-threatening.abdominal pain, vomiting, bloating, and stopping anal exhaustion are typical clinical symptoms.according to the cause of intestinal obstruction can be divided into three categories: (1) mechanical intestinal obstruction; (2) dynamic intestinal obstruction; (3) blood transport intestinal obstruction.","1, mechanical intestinal obstruction: treatment of primary disease (such as: children with congenital intestinal stenosis, intestinal wall tumor, intestinal stone, mites group, abdominal incarceration, etc.), to prevent disease progression, intestinal obstruction. 2, adhesive intestinal obstruction: more secondary to abdominal surgery, peritonitis, injury, bleeding, etc., so it is necessary to get out of bed as soon as possible after surgery. 3, the cause of intestinal obstruction is many, prevention can be done in children with tsutsugamushi should be actively deworming treatment, there should be timely repair, the operation of abdominal surgery is gentle, there are reports of postoperative carboxymethyl in the abdominal cavity sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and oral vitamin e can reduce the incidence of intestinal adhesions.","1. intestinal foreign bodies: intestinal stones, parasites, large gallstones and fecal blocks are blocked or incarcerated. 2, intestinal polyps, new organisms, benign or malignant tumors or lymphoma blockage. 3, intussusception. 4, intestinal congenital anomalies: including congenital intestinal atresia, intestinal congenital fibrous curtain or hernia formation, merkel diverticulum stenosis, etc., intestinal congenital abnormalities are generally less common. 5, intestinal or peritoneal inflammatory lesions: such as intestinal tuberculosis, crohn's disease, tuberculous peritonitis, radiation enteritis and nsaids and other drugs caused by intestinal inflammatory ulcers caused by stenosis. 6, intestinal adhesions: often due to abdominal or pelvic surgery, or intra-abdominal chronic inflammatory lesions (such as tuberculous peritonitis, crohn's disease, etc.), intestinal adhesions after surgery to the small intestine adhesions. 7, sputum: such as inguinal hernia, intra-abdominal hernia, including retinal sac sputum, femoral hernia and other incarceration. 8, intestinal torsion: reversal is more common in mesenteric tumor or its basal stenosis and other reasons. 9, extra-intestinal tumors and other compression: such as intra-abdominal, omental, mesenteric giant tumor, retroperitoneal giant tumor, pancreatic pseudocyst, etc. can cause intestinal tube compression, severe intestinal obstruction, in recent years caused by intestinal compression the intestinal obstruction has an increasing trend. dyskine-induced intestinal obstruction is caused by disturbance of intestinal muscle activity, which leads to the inability of the intestinal contents to operate. instead of mechanical factors causing intestinal obstruction inside and outside the intestinal cavity, it is also called pseudo-intestinal obstruction. the causes are: 1. after surgery paralytic ileus: common after surgery. 2, non-surgical paralytic ileus: common in: (1) electrolyte imbalance (especially blood potassium, sodium, magnesium abnormalities are more common). (2) a variety of systemic or intra-abdominal inflammation, such as sepsis, intra-abdominal abscess, severe pancreatitis and pyelonephritis, pneumonia. (3) heavy metal poisoning. (4) uremia. (5) myelitis. (6) hypothyroidism. 3, due to intestinal smooth muscle disease or intermuscular nerve plexus and other diseases caused by intestinal muscle dysfunction caused by intestinal obstruction, often referred to as chronic pseudo-intestinal obstruction, more common in the following lesions: (1) intestinal smooth muscle lesions: such as progressive systemic sclerosis, connective tissue disease, amyloidosis, radiation damage and mitochondrial myopathy, etc., patients with primary familial visceral myopathy are often accompanied by chronic pseudo-intestinal obstruction. (2) intestinal myenteric plexus lesions: can be seen in: a. neurogenic intestinal dysplasia, isolated intestinal dysplasia with neurofibromatosis, or with multiple endocrine neoplasia and myotonic dystrophy; b. multiple recessive and dominant hereditary diseases; c. sporadic visceral neuropathy (including non-inflammatory degenerative diseases and degenerative inflammatory diseases such as american trypanosomiasis, cytomegalovirus infection, etc.); d. enteric nerves or dysplasia dysplasia, such as myenteric plexus maturation disorders (often accompanied by central nervous system dysplasia and neuronal abnormalities), total colonic ganglion cell deficiency. (3) neuronal diseases: can be seen in parkinson's disease, selective acetylcholine dysfunction and brain stem tumor after eb virus infection. (4) metabolic endocrine diseases: seen in mucinous edema, pheochromocytoma, hypoparathyroidism, acute intermittent porphyria. (5) small bowel diverticulosis: seen in small intestine diverticulosis with similar progressive systemic sclerosis, with visceral neuronal disease and neuronal inclusions in the nerve cell. (6) drug factors: found in the application of phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, opiates, vincristine and narcotic bowel syndrome. 4, other: secondary to sclerosing mesenteric inflammation, steatorrhea and lipidosis. 1. the blood supply to the intestine is caused by obstacles, which often causes the muscle activity of the intestinal wall to disappear. if the blood supply to the intestine cannot be restored, the intestinal tube is prone to necrosis, especially the intestinal tube that supplies blood through the terminal branch, and the blood supply to the intestine is impeded. it is more common in mesenteric arterial thrombosis or embolism caused by various reasons, as well as mesenteric venous thrombosis. 2, according to the blood supply of the intestine can be divided into 2 categories (1) simple intestinal obstruction: only the intestinal contents are difficult to pass, and there is no intestinal blood supply disorder, but simple intestinal obstruction can evolve into strangulated intestinal obstruction. (2) strangulated intestinal obstruction: manifested as obstruction of intestinal contents, accompanied by intestinal blood vessel disorders. 3, according to the degree of obstruction can be divided into 2 categories (1) complete intestinal obstruction: the contents of the intestines can not pass. (2) incomplete intestinal obstruction: part of the intestinal contents can still pass through the obstruction, and incomplete intestinal obstruction can evolve into complete intestinal obstruction. 4, according to the obstruction site can also be divided into 3 categories (1) high intestinal obstruction: generally refers to obstruction occurring in the duodenum and jejunum. (2) low-grade small bowel obstruction: generally refers to obstruction occurring in the distal ileum. (3) colonic obstruction: generally occurs in the left colon, especially in the sigmoid colon or sigmoid colon and rectal junction. 5, according to the onset of the disease can be divided into 2 categories (1) acute intestinal obstruction: strangulated intestinal obstruction is generally acute intestinal obstruction, but also complete. (2) chronic intestinal obstruction: chronic intestinal obstruction is generally incomplete, incomplete intestinal obstruction is generally simple intestinal obstruction, chronic intestinal obstruction can also evolve into acute. the pathogenesis from simple intestinal obstruction to intestinal wall strangulation, necrosis, perforation, etc., a series of pathophysiological changes, can be divided into the following three aspects: 1, intestinal tube expansion above the obstruction site and body fluid loss obstruction in the proximal intestinal tube filled with gas and liquid, the bowel is dilated, and the intestinal wall becomes thinner in acute intestinal obstruction; chronic obstruction is often due to hyperactivity of the intestines, the muscle layer of the intestinal wall is gradually thickened, the intestinal tube is thickened, and the gas source in the intestine is three: (1) from the ingestion gas (68%): experimental intestinal obstruction in animals. if the esophagus is blocked, there is little gas accumulation in the intestine above the obstruction. clinically, it is attracted by the stomach tube to keep the stomach empty, and the intestinal tube rarely accumulates gas. (2) gas from the decomposition of food by bacteria during digestion. (3) gases from the blood that diffuse into the intestinal lumen, especially nitrogen, which account for 32% of all gases. hibbard reported in 1976 that the dog's experimental intestinal obstruction contained gas components in the intestinal lumen. the gas in the intestinal lumen, mainly n2, co2, o2, can be balanced by the penetration of mucous membranes into the blood. the diffusion of n2 is minimal, so n2 is predominant in the intestinal lumen. methane (ch4) is produced by bacteria breaking down food. hydrogen sulfide (h2s) can turn the rubber tube for decompression of the stomach into black. some people think that h2s is a substance that causes poisoning due to intestinal obstruction, but hibbard observed in 1936 that 600-800 ml of h2s saturated solution was injected into the closed jaw of the animal. no symptoms of poisoning occurred. part of the liquid in the intestine comes from ingested water, but most of it is accumulated digestive juice. normal human digestive tract secretes 8 to 10 l of digestive juice within 24 hours. except 100 to 200 ml is excreted from the human body, most of which is absorbed into the blood to maintain the dynamic balance of body fluids. the electrolyte component of the digestive juice in the intestine is similar to the electrolyte component in plasma (fig. 1), so the loss of intestinal fluid is equal to the loss of plasma. when there is low obstruction, there is less vomiting. due to the dilatation of the intestine, the absorption function of the intestinal mucosa is reduced. although some electrolytes are absorbed, the actual loss of water and electrolyte is still obvious. in the case of high obstruction, due to frequent vomiting, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice and jejunal fluid are the main factors. the loss of sodium ions is more than that of chloride ions, so there are more opportunities for acidosis. in addition, gastric juice and intestinal fluid contain twice as much potassium ions as plasma, so they are often accompanied by the loss of potassium ions. among the 400 cases of the first hospital of beijing medical university, 27.2% were low sodium, 18.5% were low chlorine, 9.8% were low potassium, 44.0% were lower than 22mmol/l, and 1.6% higher than 29mmol/l. haden and orr described in 1923-1924 that the input brine seemed to buffer the toxins absorbed by the intestines. it is now known that saline can replenish lost electrolytes, thereby prolonging the lives of patients. when the obstruction develops to a narrowing, blood loss can occur. when most of the intestines are strangulated, there is no initial interruption of complete blood circulation in the affected intestine. when the small intestine is twisted, it first affects its venous return, resulting in congestion and congestion of the intestine. following the small arterial spasm, intestinal peristalsis increases, further causing small blood vessel rupture, blood flow into the submucosa and muscle layer, resulting in hemorrhagic infarction. at this time, the blood penetrates into the intestinal cavity and the peritoneal cavity, so bloody ascites can be produced. until the narrowed intestinal pressure is equal to the arterial pressure, the blood circulation is completely interrupted, causing coagulation in the small blood vessels. the amount of blood loss is proportional to the length of the narrowed intestine. 2. an important change in the reproduction of bacteria and the absorption and obstruction of toxins is the excessive reproduction of bacteria in the intestines above the obstruction, mainly escherichia coli and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial reproduction can increase the chance of infection in surgery, especially in large bowel obstruction. in addition, the toxin produced by bacteria is absorbed into the body through the blood circulation and lymph, and can also be absorbed into the abdominal cavity through the intestinal wall and absorbed by the peritoneum. the absorption of the toxin in the abdominal cavity occurs in the late stage of intestinal obstruction. there are a large number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the intestines of normal people. the growth of anaerobic bacteria is accelerated after intestinal obstruction, and the number and distribution of bacteria in the intestinal tract are simultaneously changed. for example, bacteroides in the intestinal tract of normal animals are usually located. in the large intestine, once obstruction occurs. a large number of bacilli can also be found in the small intestine. in the case of strangulated intestinal obstruction, the bleeding of the intestine is beneficial to the reproduction of bacteria, and the large number of bacteria in the narrowed intestine and the production of a large amount of toxins are often the cause of death. in animal experiments, barnett injected the peritoneal exudate of strangulated intestinal obstruction into the abdominal cavity of other animals to kill the animal. if the twisted intestinal fistula is placed in an impermeable plastic bag, the mortality rate of the animal can be lowered. yull also found the same toxic substances in the peritoneal effusion of human strangulated intestinal obstruction in 1962. at the beginning of the strangulation, the intestinal wall transit has not changed, and the bacteria have not penetrated into the abdominal cavity, and the patient's symptoms of poisoning are not obvious. when necrosis occurs in the narrowed intestine, especially when the narrowed intestine is long, the reproduction of escherichia coli and streptococcus in the intestinal lumen reaches a peak, and the symptoms of poisoning are severe. once the intestine ruptures, the infection and shock are more serious, endangering the patient's life. 3, the increase of intestinal pressure on the intestinal tract affects the intestinal pressure, pressure on the intestinal wall, in addition to the expansion of the intestinal tract also affects the absorption of intestinal mucosa, but also the intestinal wall of the blood circulation disorders, causing intestinal wall necrosis. the normal intestinal pressure is 0.267 to 0.533 kpa (2 to 4 mmhg), and the intestinal pressure above the obstruction can be raised to 1.33 kpa (10 mmhg) or more. simple low intestinal obstruction, due to the longer intestinal tube above the obstruction, the intestinal pressure is lower, the small intestinal obstruction lasts 48 ~ 96h, the intestinal pressure is generally 0.53 ~ 1.87kpa (4 ~ 14mmhg). in the case of peristalsis orgasm, the pressure can reach 2.67 ~ 4kpa (20 ~ 30mmhg). when the distal end of the colon is obstructed, the intracolonic pressure is higher. because 60% of patients, the ileocecal valve function is good, the colon becomes a closed, so the internal pressure can be as high as 2.45kpa (25cmh2o). also because the intestinal wall of the cecum is thin, and it is the concentration point of stress reaction. therefore, in this case, perforation is likely to occur in the cecum. the increase in intestinal pressure causes the intestine to swell, and also increases bowel movements and intestinal colic. long-lasting increase in intestinal pressure can cause paralysis of the intestinal muscles, weakened bowel movements, and weakened bowel sounds. an increase in intestinal pressure will cause a slowing of venous return. after intestinal obstruction for 48-96 hours, it can be observed that water, glucose, strychnine (strychnine) which can be penetrated at normal time has obvious absorption and decline. in contrast, lymphatic absorption is enhanced. experiments have shown that in the intestinal tube of the obstruction, a dye can be seen in the lymph nodes of the mesentery; when injected into the non-obstructed intestine, no dye appears in the same time. this may be due to the stagnation of intestinal contents, which increases the venous pressure and accelerates the lymphatic circulation, which promotes the absorption of this dye. in addition, above the obstruction, intestinal venous return is blocked, intestinal edema, secretion of water, sodium, potassium increased. a small intestine of 15 cm can secrete 500 ml of liquid. if the intestinal hypertension rises for too long, a change in intestinal permeability is produced.in 1935, sperling and wangensten used dogs to perform ileal closed bowel obstruction experiments.it was found that when the intestinal pressure reached the intracapillary capillary pressure for 10 hours (pressure 2.0 kpa, or 15 mmhg), the vitality and permeability of the intestinal wall did not change significantly. after 28 hours, the vitality was lost and the permeability was enhanced.recently, deitch experiment found that the simple intestinal obstruction 6h, bacteria can reach the mesenteric lymph nodes, 24h up to the liver, spleen and blood flow.the authors believe that this is due to bacterial growth and barriers to the intestinal mucosal barrier.when the intestinal canal pressure continues to rise and the intestinal wall pressure is equal to or greater than the intestinal wall internal arterial perfusion pressure, the intestinal wall produces ischemia.if the obstruction is not relieved at this time, necrosis and perforation of the intestinal wall can be produced.bacterial toxins in the intestinal lumen enter the abdominal cavity, causing severe infection poisoning as described above, entering the most dangerous state of intestinal obstruction pathology, often taking away the patient's life.","['constipation with abdominal mass',

xanthium poisoning,"xanthium poisoning is mainly caused by accidental consumption of xanthium fruits or seedlings (mistaken as bean sprouts), and poisoning caused by mild poisoning, such as dizziness, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, facial flushing, conjunctival hyperemia, urticaria, etc., within 12 hours of ingestion, can induce vomiting, then can be washed with 1:2.000 potassium permanganate, and with high temperature saline to wash the intestines and take laxatives, intravenous infusion to protect the liver and symptomatic treatment.","professional guidance 1. do not eat with pork. 2. it is not advisable to eat dried sweet cakes, and it is not allowed to eat raw leaves or fruits at will. 3. strictly control the dosage and take it according to the doctor's advice. 4. strengthen publicity, do not eat xanthium and buds, especially the promotion of children. daily prevention of reasonable dietary habits: maintain a light diet.eat more fresh vegetables and aquatic products.such as green vegetables, radishes, kelp, seaweed and so on.should eat less meals.fasting fat meat and animal offal, do not eat spicy onions, peppers, coffee, etc.eat less refined sugar, honey, fruit candy, cakes, etc.","the main reason is the ingestion of xanthium poisoning, xanthium is a wild plant, the countryside can be seen everywhere, xanthium is poisonous, and the cocklebur sprouts after spring rain, often growing into clumps, the shape is very similar to the yellow bean sprouts. at this time, the toxicity is the strongest and the toxicity the substance is the toxic protein xanthium.","['mouth vomiting', 'blood pressure drop', 'respiratory failure', 'sleepiness', 'diarrhea', 'abdominal pain', 'lack of strength', 'dizziness', 'disgusting', 'stunning']",['respiratory failure'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
systemic infections caused by enterovirus,"enteroviruses include poliovirus, cox-sackievirus, enterocytopathic human- phanvirus (echovirus), and new enterovirus type 68-71 newly discovered in recent years. the relationship between coxsackie virus and echovirus and new enterovirus and human diseases. these viruses cause widespread or epidemic morbidity around the world, affecting various systems of the whole body, and are increasingly valued by people, especially in childhood. . the clinical manifestations are complex and diverse, although most of them are mild, but they can also be life-threatening.can cause aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis, myocarditis, epidemic chest pain, rash disease, herp angina, respiratory tract infection, infant diarrhea and epidemic acute conjunctivitis.","paying attention to environmental hygiene and personal hygiene, and strengthening physical exercise will help prevent the epidemic. for infants and young children who are exposed to the patient, they can inject 3 to 6 ml of gamma globulin or 6 to 9 ml of placental globulin to prevent infection. a live attenuated polio vaccine that produces intestinal disturbances and controls the prevalence of aseptic meningitis caused by other enteroviruses. this is a non-specific preventive measure that deserves further study due to the coxsackie virus. there are many types of echovirus and other enteroviruses. therefore, preparation-specific vaccines have certain difficulties, and they are not universally applicable. in recent years, many people have advocated some types related to pandemic, such as frequent sterility. coxsackie a7 and ecotype 9 viruses, which are prevalent in meningitis, and coxsackie b group 2, 3, 4, and 5 viruses, which often cause severe myocarditis, should actively prepare live attenuated vaccines. 1. in situ isolation to avoid contact with early detection of infectious sources, children who find signs of foot and foot, do not send nursery schools, kindergartens; isolation treatment, separate accommodation, utensils, toys should be separated; so as not to infect other children. 2. infecting the sick from the mouth, preventing close contact with ev71 infection mainly through saliva, herpes liquid, fecal contamination of food and articles, and children and adults may be infected. avoid faeces, mouth and nose secretions contaminating water and food, thoroughly dispose of the child's fecal excretion, diapers should be washed and disinfected, and children's bottles and utensils should be disinfected frequently. 3. develop health habits to educate children and students to develop hygiene habits from childhood, to get rid of the habit of rubbing their fingers, away from garbage and unclean environment; to develop the habit of washing hands thoroughly after the game, before and after meals. adults have no symptoms after infection and become a hidden source of infection, which is even more dangerous. 4. strengthening environmental sanitation the environment of the child care institutions, toys, public swimming pools, etc. must be strictly disinfected. pay attention to the harmless treatment of feces and never allow polluted water. improve the epidemic reporting system. anyone who has fever, cold or respiratory symptoms, or who has a hand, foot, and herpes rash should go to the hospital. 5. pay attention to health, stay away from viruses for the peak period of the upcoming enterovirus epidemic (six-september), parents of children under the age of 15 should be alert and take preventive measures. 6. improve human immunity and resist the spread ofviralviruses. in addition to staying away from viruses, it is also necessary to strengthen natural immunity against viruses. this requires us to appropriately increase the intake of fresh vegetables and fruits.","the most characteristic of coxsackie virus is that it can cause disease in mice. according to the different pathogenic diseases of the suckling mice, it can be divided into two groups, a and b. a group of viruses have been found to have 23 types (a1~24 type, among which type 23 has been classified as eke 9). this group of viruses can cause extensive skeletal muscle myositis and necrosis in suckling mice, causing flaccid paralysis, but most of them are difficult to separate in tissue culture. group b virus has been found to type 6 ( types 1 to 6 can cause focal myositis and brown fat necrosis, myocarditis, hepatitis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, etc., causing limb tremors and tonic paralysis. group b viruses can be isolated in tissue culture. echovirus has found 31 types (types 1 to 34, of which types 10, 28, and 34 have been classified as other viruses), which are only infectious to humans, but not to suckling mice, monkey kidney or human kidney cells. echovirus is very sensitive and is commonly used to isolate viruses. since 1986, a new enterovirus type 68-71 has been discovered that is immunospecifically different from known coxsackieviruses and echoviruses. there is generally no cross-immunization, and only a few types have antigenic crossovers. the virus invades from the pharynx or intestine, propagates in the local mucosa or lymphoid tissue, and is locally excreted. at this time, local symptoms may occur, and then the virus invades the local lymph nodes, thereby entering the blood circulation and causing viremia (first time) viremia), the virus can be carried along the bloodstream to various organs of the body such as the central nervous system, skin and mucous membranes, heart, respiratory organs, liver, pancreas, muscles, etc., where further reproduction causes lesions and re-enters the blood circulation, causing viremia (second viremia). different virus strains have different tissue tropism and different target organs, which cause different systemic diseases. the pathological changes are different depending on the organs and extents. the central nervous system lesions are similar to polio, but generally lighter, with meningeal inflammation. more common, encephalitis patients with focal mononuclear cell infiltration and degeneration, coxsackie b virus infection in the newborn often cause extensive lesions, involving the brain, liver, heart, mainly focal necrosis, with lymph cell and neutrophil infiltration, patients with myocarditis often have interstitial blood stasis and inflammatory cell accumulation, myocardial fibrotic necrosis, nuclear pyknosis, rupture, pericardial inflammatory infiltration, etc., muscle can be seen in severe cell infiltration or muscle fiber necrosis.","['spotted', 'maculopapular rash', 'cyanosis', 'convulsion', 'asphyxia']",['meningitis'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
biliary cirrhosis,"biliary cirrhosis refers to cirrhosis caused by lesions of the bile duct system, from the small bile duct to the extrahepatic bile duct.microbiliary tube is generally caused by long-term intrahepatic biliary retention or extrahepatic biliary obstruction.the former is called primary biliary cirrhosis, and the latter is called secondary biliary sclerosis.90% of the disease occurs in women, especially in women aged 40 to 60 years old, male: female is 1:8.early symptoms were only mild fatigue and intermittent itching, 1/2 had hepatomegaly, 1/4 had splenomegaly, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and 污-gt were often the only positive findings.end-stage manifestations of liver failure, variceal rupture, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, edema with deep jaundice.",the pathogenesis is unclear and there is no precautionary approach.,"autoimmune (60%): the disease is unknown, chronic progressive cholestasis liver disease, may be related to autoimmunity.pbc is generally considered to be an autoimmune disease. when lymphocytes are activated, they attack the middle and small bile ducts, causing an inflammatory reaction.histologically, it appears that the host's rejection of the graft has many similarities with the rejection of liver allografts. clinically, the condition is relieved and worsened, often accompanied by other autoimmune diseases such as sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.humoral immunity was significantly abnormal, the anti-mitochondrial antibody positive rate was 90% to 100%, and 80% of patients had a titer greater than 1:80. some people even included anti-mitochondrial antibody positive as a case when the pb c was studied. extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (30%): biliary cirrhosis is divided into primary biliary cirrhosis (pbc) and secondary biliary cirrhosis (secondary biliary cirrhosis).the latter is caused by long-term obstruction of the extrahepatic bile duct.","['portal venous stasis', 'liver leaf atrophy', 'liver palm', 'ascites', 'corneal color film ring', 'biliary retention', 'hepatomegaly', 'cholelithiasis', 'alkaline increased phosphatase']",['hepatic and kidney syndrome'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
d-type viral hepatitis,"viral hepatitis (viralhepatitis type d) is an acute and chronic hepatic inflammatory lesion caused by hepadnaviruses such as hepatitis d virus (hdv) and hepatitis b virus.hdv is a defective virus with few hdv infections and can only be found in hbv-infected individuals and certain hepadnavirus-positive antigen-positive animals.the clinical manifestations of hepatitis d depend to some extent on the concomitant status of hbv infection.hdv and +hbv overlap infection, can promote liver damage, and easy to develop chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and severe hepatitis.hepatitis d is mainly transmitted through blood transfusions and blood products, similar to the mode of transmission of hepatitis b.","1. strict screening of blood donors to ensure the quality of blood and blood products is an effective way to reduce the incidence of hepatitis d after transfusion. 2. for people with hbv susceptibility, extensive vaccination with hepatitis b vaccine is a powerful measure to finally eliminate the carrier status of hbsag, and it is also a feasible method to control hdv infection.","(1) causes of the disease the intact hdv particles are spherical, 35-37 nm in diameter, containing hdv rna and hdag, and the outer shell is hbsag. hdv rna is the genome of hdv, consisting of 1679-1683 nucleotides, which is single-stranded, circular, and folded into a non-branched rod-like structure, hdv-rna has 9 coding regions (orf), orf5 encodes hdag, hdag is a nuclear protein that enables the body to induce anti-hdigm and anti-hdigg, anti-hdigm earlier, it is usually positive in the early stage of acute hdv infection, and the recovery period gradually disappears. the high titer of anti-hdigm indicates chronic disease, and anti-hd igg appears later, and it can be maintained for many years after 3 to 8 weeks after onset. low titer positive, anti-hdigg increased when the disease activity, the current infection often showed anti-hdigm positive, the previous infection was anti-hdigm negative, and anti-hdigg positive, anti-hd is not neutralizing antibody, still positive it can be contagious. hdv infection can significantly inhibit the synthesis of hbv dna. serological tests show that hdag is consistent with the decrease of hbv dna in serum. when hdag expression is increased, hbv dna is decreased. when hdag expression is at a peak, hbv dna often disappears, but with with the appearance of hdag-negative and anti-hd, hbv dna returned to its original level. it was previously thought that the assembly of hdv relied on the synthesis of hbsag, and its replication and expression also required the assistance of hbv or other hepadnaviruses. the replication of hdv-rna and the expression of hdag do not require the help of hepadnavirus. hdv itself can be done independently, but in the formation of intact hdv, it must be provided by hepadnavirus to complete the shell. (two) pathogenesis clinical and animal experiments showed that after hdv infection, liver function damage was directly proportional to serum and intrahepatic hdag titer. in situ hybridization was used to detect the distribution of hdv rna in liver cells in areas with obvious damage to liver cells. therefore, hdv is considered to be directly caused by hepatocyte injury, some scholars also found that chronic hepatitis b or hbsag carriers overlap in hdv infection after clinical manifestations of severity, liver tissue from normal, mild inflammation to severe hepatic necrosis, accompanied by heavier inflammatory cells in the portal area infiltration, suggesting that the incidence of hepatitis d is related to the host's immune response in addition to the direct cytotoxicity of hdv.","['intrahepatic hdag only...', 'hepatic lesions are diffuse', 'appetite deficiency', 'lack of strength']",['cirrhosis'],['hepatopathy'],['medical treatement']
bile reflux gastritis,"bile reflux gastritis, also known as alkaline reflux gastritis, refers to a series of manifestations of upper abdominal pain, vomiting bile, bloating, weight loss caused by bile reflux into the stomach, common in gastrectomy, gastrointestinal after anastomosis, the total incidence rate is about 5%, and the incidence of billroth ii gastrectomy is 2 to 3 times that of billroth i. in view of its symptoms, pathological changes, and treatment response and other post-gastric resection syndromes. in contrast, roberts et al. classified the disease from complications after gastrectomy and classified it as an independent disease.","1. diet: pay attention to a small number of meals, eat a low-fat diet, can reduce the frequency of reflux symptoms after eating, on the contrary, high-fat diet can promote the secretion of cholecystokinin in the small intestinal mucosa, easily lead to reflux of gastrointestinal contents. 2. weight: those who are overweight should lose weight, because the abdominal pressure of obese people is increased, which can promote gastric reflux, especially in the supine position, so it should actively reduce weight to improve reflux symptoms. 3. lying position: the bed head is 15-20cm high, which is a good way to reduce the reflux of gastric juice at night.","the occurrence of this syndrome must first have the basic conditions of pyloric function loss or pyloric insufficiency. for example, after gastric resection or gastrointestinal anastomosis, bile can directly flow back into the stomach; some patients have no history of surgery, duodenum content the substance can be returned to the stomach through the closed pylorus, causing reflux gastritis. after the cholecystectomy, the function of storing bile is lost, and the bile continues to flow into the duodenum. if the pylorus is closed, it can flow back into the stomach. fluid gastritis.gastrin can stimulate the proliferation of gastric mucosal cells to strengthen its barrier and prevent the reverse dispersion of h+, but the gastrin secretion is reduced by about 50-75% after billroth ii gastrectomy, which may be an important cause of this syndrome. one. biliary reflux into the stomach after gastrectomy is a common phenomenon, but not every person has symptoms, the cause of which may be related to the following factors: 1 gastric emptying disorder reflux fluid in the stomach for a long time, ph rise, aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria in the residual stomach are more likely to grow. these bacteria can cause the bile salts to liberate and cause inflammation of the gastric mucosa, thus causing symptoms; 2 changes in bile acid composition gadacz found that normal bile acid components do not develop symptoms, but deoxycholic symptoms of acid increase are often symptomatic; 3 there are bacteria in the gastric juice, there are gram-negative bacilli or pseudomonas in the gastric juice, and the use of doxycycline can alleviate the symptoms; while the asymptomatic patients have no gastric juice. bacteria exist; 4 sodium concentration in gastric juice exceeds 15mmol / l is prone to gastritis, while sodium concentration below 15mmol / l is no gastritis. helicobacter pylori infection causes inflammation of the gastric mucosa, and bile reflux gastritis can coexist with hp infection. both hp infection and bile reflux are associated with mucosal damage, which may affect the gastroduodenum by increasing gastrin release. power, causing bile reflux. for example, primary pyloric sphincter dysfunction can prolong pyloric opening time, pyloric relaxation or sputum continuous open state, so that duodenal contents flow back into the stomach, causing duodenogastric reflux; such as gastrointestinal neuropeptides and abnormal hormone levels can lead to disturbances in gastrointestinal motility leading to duodenogastric reflux.","['disgusting and vomiting', 'middle and upper abdominal pain', 'weight loss', 'diarrhea', 'biliary reflux', 'biliary retention', 'disgusting', 'wasting']",['stomach ulcer'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medications such as bile sorbents, prokinetic drugs']"
cholangiocarcinoma,"cholangiocarcinoma refers to extrahepatic bile duct malignancies originating from the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts to the lower end of the common bile duct. the cholangiocarcinoma can be divided into three types: hilar cholangiocarcinoma or upper cholangiocarcinoma, middle cholangiocarcinoma and lower cholangiocarcinoma.primary cholangiocarcinoma is rare, accounting for 0.01% to 0.46% of common autopsy, 2% of autopsy in cancer patients, 0.3% to 1.8% of biliary surgery, and 1.5 to 5 times of gallbladder cancer in europe and america. the data is more cholangiocarcinoma than gallbladder cancer.the ratio of men to women is about 1.5 to 3.0.the age of onset is mostly 50 to 70 years old, but it can also be seen in young people.the cause may be related to diseases such as bile duct stones and primary sclerosing cholangitis.surgical treatment, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and other methods can be used clinically, but the prognosis is poor.","1. maintain a pleasant psychological state, develop good eating habits, fast food, eat less thick food, and do not drink hard alcohol. 2, for people over the age of 40, especially women, regular b-ultrasound examination, found cholecystitis, gallstones or polyps, etc., should be followed up and found that changes in the condition should be treated early. 3, before actively treating cancer lesions, sooner or later, in addition to the cause of cancer may cause. 4, biliary tumor prevention should focus on the early treatment of its closely related diseases and precancerous lesions, non-invasive examination b-ultrasound should be used as the basic means of the disease screening. 1 primary prevention the etiology of cholangiocarcinoma is still unclear, and the relationship with cholelithiasis is not as close as gallbladder cancer. therefore, primary prevention of cholangiocarcinoma lacks effective methods, mainly for the prevention and treatment of hepatolithiasis and regular systematic health examination. 2 secondary prevention secondary prevention is the focus of prevention of this disease. patients with obstructive jaundice should be highly alert to the possibility of cholangiocarcinoma in the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, hepatitis, cirrhosis and other diseases. on the basis of detailed medical history and comprehensive physical examination, it should be done as soon as possible. b-ultrasound, ct, ptc and ercp examination for early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment. 3 tertiary prevention the third-level preventive measure is that patients with biliary cancer should be treated promptly, improve the cure rate, survival rate, recovery rate and quality of life, reduce their complications, prevent disability, and alleviate the pain caused by cancer.","the etiology of cholangiocarcinoma is still not well understood and has been found to be related to the following factors: long-term chronic inflammatory stimuli are the basis of cholangiocarcinoma, because it is clinically found that diseases associated with cholangiocarcinoma can cause chronic inflammation of the bile duct, and certain substances in bile (such as metabolites of bile acids) have long-term stimulation of the biliary mucosa. causes epithelial dysplasia. it has been reported that the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with ulcerative colitis is 10 times higher than that of the general population. the age of onset of cholangiocarcinoma with ulcerative colitis is 20 to 30 years earlier than the average, with an average of 40 to 45 years old, often with long-term a history of colitis, chronic bacteremia in the patient's portal system may be the cause of cholangiocarcinoma and psc. the lesions are multi-wave and the whole colon. the biliary tract cancer caused by ulcerative colitis may be related to chronic portal bacteremia. 20% to 57% of patients with cholangiocarcinoma are associated with gallstones, so the chronic stimulation of stones may be considered a carcinogenic factor. congenital biliary cysts are easy to become cancerous. the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with congenital biliary cysts is as high as 2.5% to 28%. the biliary cystic deformity is 20 to 30 years earlier than normal, although 75% of biliary cystic malformations occur in infancy and childhood, but in the case of cholangiocarcinoma, 3/4 of the patients have symptoms of biliary cystic malformation in adulthood. the mechanism of biliary cystic malformation leading to cholangiocarcinoma is considered to be pancreatic. when the opening of the bile duct into the bile duct is abnormally high, the pancreatic juice will flow back into the bile duct to cause malignant transformation of the bile duct epithelium. other factors that may cause malignant transformation include biliary stasis, stone formation and chronic inflammation in the cystic cavity. clonorchis sinensis infection is also considered to be associated with the occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma. although clonorchiasis is parasitic in the intrahepatic bile duct, it can also be parasitic in the extrahepatic bile duct, and the worm body itself and metabolites have long-term stimulation of the bile duct mucosal epithelium. , causing bile duct mucosal hyperplasia, resulting in tumor-like changes, cancer. cholangiocarcinoma can occur after many years of surgery and can occur in bile ducts without stones, mainly due to epithelial changes in chronic biliary infections, often after drainage in the biliary tract. radioactive cerium oxide among patients with a history of exposure to sputum, the age of onset of cholangiocarcinoma was 10 years earlier than that of those without sputum exposure, and the average incubation period was 35 years (after contact with sputum), and more occurred in the distal end of the intrahepatic biliary tree. sclerosing cholangitis patients with malignant primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) have a higher chance of developing cholangiocarcinoma than the general population. psc is also associated with ulcerative colitis. type b and hepatitis c virus infection recent studies have found that hepatitis b and hepatitis c infection may be related to the occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma, but the specific mechanism remains to be further studied. k-ras gene mutation in recent years, molecular biology studies have shown that the mutation rate of k-ras gene 12 codon in cholangiocarcinoma is 77.4%, indicating that k-ras gene mutation may play an important role in the occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma. pathogenesis cholangiocarcinoma can occur in various parts of the extrahepatic bile duct, of which the proximal bile duct (hepatic bile duct) is the most common, accounting for 58%; the middle and long bile ducts account for 13% and 18% respectively (fig. 1), occurring in the cystic duct 4%, and another 7% is diffuse. 1, pathological features (1) gross morphological classification according to the general morphology of the tumor, cholangiocarcinoma can be divided into four types: papillary type, sclerotic type, nodular type and diffuse infiltration type. among them, the infiltrating type is more common, followed by the nodular type, while the nipple type is less common. cholangiocarcinoma generally has less mass formation, but most of the wall infiltration, thickening, luminal occlusion; cancer tissue is easy to infiltrate surrounding tissues, often invading the nerves and liver; patients often suffer from intrahepatic and biliary infections and death. 1 papillary carcinoma: grayish white or pink fragile tissue with a general shape of papillary shape, often with multiple lesions in the tube, growing to the surface, forming papillary structures of varying sizes, arranged neatly, with normal tissue between cancer cells, good in the lower bile duct, it is easy to cause incomplete obstruction of the bile duct. this type of tumor mainly infiltrates along the bile duct mucosa. generally, it does not infiltrate the bile duct surrounding tissue, blood vessels, nerve lymphatic space and liver tissue infiltration. the success rate of surgical resection is high and the prognosis is good. 2 sclerosing carcinoma: a grayish-white annular induration, often infiltrated along the lower layer of the bile duct mucosa, thickening the bile duct wall, a large amount of fibrous tissue hyperplasia, and infiltrating into the outside of the tube to form a fibrous lumps; with partial biliary obstruction, lesion bile duct accompanied ulcer, chronic inflammation, and dysplasia, occur in the hilar bile duct, is the most common type of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, sclerosing cancer cells differentiate well, often scattered in a large number of fibrous connective tissue, easy it is confused with sclerosing cholangitis, scarring caused by chronic inflammation of the bile duct wall, and fibroplasia. sometimes it is difficult to make a correct diagnosis even in the frozen histopathological biopsy. sclerosing cancer has obvious infiltration along the bile duct wall. the tendency to invade the tissues around the bile duct and the invasion of the liver parenchyma, so it is often necessary to remove the liver lobe during radical surgical resection. however, the surgical margin often leaves cancerous tissue, and the true radical resection is not achieved, and the prognosis is poor. 3 nodular carcinoma: the mass forms a nodule that protrudes into the distal part of the bile duct. the base of the nodule is continuous with the wall of the bile duct. the inner surface of the bile duct is often irregular. the tumor is generally small, the base is wide, and the surface is irregular. tumors often infiltrate along the bile duct mucosa, and the degree of infiltration of tissues and blood vessels around the bile duct is lighter than that of sclerosis. the surgical resection rate is higher and the prognosis is better. 4 diffuse invasive carcinoma: less common, accounting for 7% of cholangiocarcinoma, cancer tissue extensively infiltrated into the liver along the bile duct wall, external bile duct, thickening of the wall, stenosis of the lumen, obvious inflammation of the connective tissue around the tube, difficult to determine the original bile duct site of cancer is generally inoperable and has a poor prognosis. (2) histological classification more than 95% of cholangiocarcinomas are adenocarcinomas, and a few are squamous cell carcinomas, mucinous carcinomas, cystadenocarcinomas, etc. in primary extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, common bile duct cancer is the most common, 33% to 40%; hepatic duct cancer, 30% to 32%; hepatic duct bifurcation, 20%; cystic duct 4%. there is no uniform classification of histology of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. it is commonly divided into 6 types according to the degree of differentiation and growth pattern of cancer cells: 1 papillary adenocarcinoma; 2 well-differentiated adenocarcinoma; 3 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; 4 undifferentiated carcinoma; 5 signet ring cell carcinoma; 6 squamous cell carcinoma. adenocarcinoma is more common, and the classification report is not consistent, but the most common histological type is still papillary adenocarcinoma, highly differentiated adenocarcinoma, accounting for more than 90%, and a few are poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma. there are also rare reports of common bile duct leiomyosarcoma. 2. transfer route about 71.4% of cholangiocarcinoma has direct infiltration or metastasis, 33.3% of which affect the liver, 33.3% of which affect the lymph nodes, 17.5% of the peritoneal dissemination, due to blood vessels around the bile duct, lymphatic network and nerve bundles, cholangiocarcinoma can through multiple channels along the bile duct to spread into the liver or outside the liver, retention, growth and reproduction, cholangiocarcinoma metastasis including lymphatic metastasis, hematogenous metastasis, nerve metastasis, infiltration and metastasis, etc., can be transferred to many other organs through various ways the hilar cholangiocarcinoma cells can spread and spread in the intrahepatic direction and the duodenal ligament through multiple channels along the lymphatic vessels around the bile duct, blood vessels and nerves, but less distant metastasis occurs. (1) lymphatic metastasis more common, often metastasis to the hilar and peripancreatic lymph nodes, less distant lymphatic metastasis, lymph node metastasis rate of the above cholangiocarcinoma is higher, bile duct in the liver and portal vein, the branch of the hepatic artery is wrapped in the glisson sheath, there are abundant nerve fibers and lymph, glisson sheaths extend to the hepatoduodenal ligament, which is rich in nerve fibers, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes and loose connective tissue, and the bile duct itself is rich in submucosal blood vessels and lymphatics. in recent years, with the development of high-grade cholangiocarcinoma resection, the lymph node drainage of the hepatic hilum has been paid attention to. someone has confirmed the lymph node in the posterior portal vein of the liver transverse groove in the anatomy of 27 cases of hilar lymph nodes, and the massive draining lymph. the tube is accompanied by the portal vein, and there is a thick lymphatic communication between the common lymph node, the common bile duct lymph node and the hepatic artery lymph node. lymphatic metastasis is the most common metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma and may occur at an early stage. it has been reported that only regional pathological examination is limited to early stage cholangiocarcinoma in the mucosa. regional lymph node metastasis occurs. the lymph node group of cholangiocarcinoma is: 1 cystic duct lymph node; 2 common bile duct lymph nodes; 3 small omental pore lymph nodes; 4 pancreaticoduodenal anterior and posterior lymph nodes; 5 pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes; 6 portal vein posterior lymph nodes; 7 celiac para-aortic lymph nodes; 8 hepatic artery lymph nodes; 9 anterior and posterior lymph nodes of the common hepatic artery; 10 superior mesenteric lymph nodes, divided into superior mesenteric artery, lower pancreaticoduodenal artery and colonic artery root and the first jejunal artery root 4 groups of lymph nodes. in general, lymph node metastasis of the hilar cholangiocarcinoma is mainly along the hepatic artery; the lymph node metastasis of the middle cholangiocarcinoma is extensive, and in addition to the invasion of the pancreatic lymph node, the superior mesenteric artery and the para-aortic lymph node may be involved; distal cholangiocarcinoma, metastatic lymph nodes are mostly confined around the head of the pancreas. (2) infiltration transfer more common, biliary cancer cells directly infiltrating up and down the bile duct wall is one of the main features of cholangiocarcinoma metastasis. the upper cholangiocarcinoma infiltrates into the liver of the adjacent bile duct, the central cholangiocarcinoma infiltrates into the hepatic artery and portal vein, and the lower cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic infiltration, cancer cells diffuse invasive growth in the bile duct wall, and coexist with the bile duct and surrounding connective tissue hyperplasia, making the invasive range of cholangiocarcinoma difficult to identify, which makes it difficult to determine the extent of resection during surgery, in addition, the result of direct infiltration it also causes important adjacent structures around the bile duct, such as large blood vessels, and the liver is invaded, which limits the scope of surgical resection and makes it difficult to achieve radical resection. residual cancer tissue is one of the main causes of rapid recurrence after surgery. liver metastasis is the upper part. the main mode of metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma is less common in peritoneal dissemination. (3) hematogenous transfer up to the whole body, the most common is lung, up to 10% to 25%. pathological studies have shown that 58.3% to 77.5% of vascular invasion in and around cholangiocarcinoma specimens indicate that invasion of blood vessels is a common biology of cholangiocarcinoma cells. phenomenon, vascular density of cholangiocarcinoma is significantly correlated with the incidence of cancer metastasis, and the incidence of metastasis increases with the increase of tumor vascular density, suggesting that tumor angiogenesis plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma. it is observed that cholangiocarcinoma often occurs in lymphatic system metastasis. in fact, tumor angiogenesis and vascular invasion are closely related to lymphatic metastasis. therefore, tumor angiogenesis and vascular invasion are the basic links in the process of cholangiocarcinoma infiltration and metastasis. (4) spread along the nerve the incidence of neurological invasion can reach 33.3%-83.4%. therefore, the clinical manifestations of jaundice and pain are common symptoms. the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve that innervates the extrahepatic biliary tract constitute the pre-hepatic plexus and posterior hepatic nerve on the hepatoduodenal ligament. the plexus, surrounded by nerve fibers, has a complete outer membrane, a continuous gap called the perineural space. in the past, it was thought that the perivascular space was a component of the lymphatic system, but it was later confirmed by light and electron microscopy. the peripheral space is an independent system, which has nothing to do with the lymphatic system. tumor cells can be transferred to the proximal or distal direction through the perivascular space. statistics show that cancer cells infiltrate around the nerve and connect with the liver and hepatoduodenal ligament. the tissue metastasis was significantly correlated, suggesting that the liver metastasis of the liver, duodenal ligament and surrounding connective tissue may be achieved by the spread of cancer cells around the nerve interstitial space. therefore, the perivascular space infiltration should be the prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma. key factor. 3. clinical pathological staging of cholangiocarcinoma at present, the clinical use of the international union against cancer (uicc) tnm staging criteria is an important reference for measuring the condition, determining the treatment strategy and assessing the prognosis. bismuth-corlette divides hilar cholangiocarcinoma into the following five types according to the location of the lesion. it is widely used in clinical practice at home and abroad: type i: the tumor is located in the common hepatic duct and does not invade the confluence; type ii: the tumor is located in the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts and does not invade the left and right hepatic ducts; type iii: the tumor is located in the bile duct of the confluence and has invaded the right hepatic duct (iiia) or invaded the left hepatic duct (iiib); type iv: the tumor has invaded the left and right bilateral hepatic ducts. on this basis, domestic scholars have divided iv into iva and ivb.","[' gallbladder enlargement', 'fever with joint swelling and pain', 'abdominal discomfort', 'diarrhea', 'ascites', 'abdominal pain', 'low strength', 'nausea', 'bile excretion blocked']",['cirrhosis ascites'],"['oncology', 'oncology']","['surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
colorectal carcinoid,"carcinoid, also known as argyrophiloma, occurs in the argyrophilic cells of the intestinal mucosa (kulchitsky cells), which are chromaffic.because it occurs from the lower part of the mucosa, it extends to the submucosal at an early stage and has been attributed to submucosal tumors.the disease is a rare low-grade malignant tumor, mostly local invasive growth with little metastasis.carcinoids occur in the appendix, small intestine, rectum, stomach, duodenum and small intestine diverticulum.","1, diet adjustment although colorectal cancer has a certain genetic predisposition, most of the sporadic colorectal cancer is closely related to environmental factors, especially dietary factors. dietary intervention can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. 1 energy intake energy intake is associated with colorectal cancer.most studies have shown that total energy intake is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer, whether it is protein, fat or carbohydrate.reducing energy intake may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. 2 the occurrence of fat and red meat colorectal cancer is closely related to animal fat and meat. studies have shown that women with high fat injection have a 32% increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with low-fat women.the intake of red meat in meat is a strong risk factor for colorectal cancer.reducing the amount of fat in the food, especially if you try to eat less brown meat after roasting, can help the occurrence of colorectal cancer. 3 fruits, vegetables and dietary fiber cellulose can increase the amount of feces, dilute the carcinogen in the colon, and adsorb bile salts, which can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer.therefore, in the usual diet, you should eat as much vegetables, fruits, and cellulose as possible, and eat properly to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. 4 vitamins and trace elements have been shown that vitamin a, c, e can make colonic epithelial hyperplasia of adenoma patients into normal, but the current data does not support the use of antioxidant vitamins to prevent colorectal cancer.the relationship between trace elements and colorectal cancer is not yet detailed.folic acid can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, but the specific mechanism is not clear. 5 dietary anti-carcinogen diet of garlic, onion, leeks, sulphate contained in sucrose; citrus contains scorpion; grape, strawberry, apple plant phenol and carrot, yam, carotene contained in watermelon both are thought to be able to inhibit mutations and have anticancer effects.especially for garlic, studies have shown that garlic is the vegetable with the strongest protective effect and frees people from distal colon cancer. 2, change lifestyle habits 1 and exercise, especially abdominal type is an independent risk factor for colorectal cancer, too little physical activity is a risk factor for colorectal cancer.physical activity can affect the colonic peristalsis and facilitate the discharge of feces, thus achieving the prevention of colorectal cancer. 2 the relationship between smoking and colorectal cancer is not very positive, but smoking is a risk factor for colorectal adenoma. the current study believes that smoking is a stimulating factor for colorectal cancer gene production, but it takes about 40 years to occur. effect. 3 alcohol intake is related to colorectal cancer, alcohol is also a risk factor for colorectal adenoma, but the specific reasons are not clear.reducing alcohol intake is good for preventing colorectal cancer. 4 reproductive factors hormone and reproductive factors may affect the occurrence of colorectal cancer. american studies have shown that the incidence of colorectal cancer in single women is higher than that of married women. some people think that this is related to hormones affecting bile acid metabolism.","the cause is unknown.it has been reported that colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, and the incidence of colorectal cancer after cholecystectomy increase.other studies suggest that it is related to genetic factors and eating habits.","['alternative diarrhea and constipation', 'abdominal discomfort', 'bleeding blood and blood mixed with feces', 'abnormal frequency of defecation']",['colon polyps'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

enemy mouse poisoning,"diphacinone is a widely used anticoagulant rodenticide, which is highly toxic. because of its chemical structure, competitors can interfere with the utilization of vitamin k by the liver, inhibit the synthesis of coagulation factors and prothrombin, and metabolites can damage capillaries and increase the permeability of the vessel wall, leading to severe internal bleeding.at present, the commonly used products have 1% enemy mouse powder and 1% enemy sodium salt.pediatric poisoning is caused by improper placement of this type of poisonous rat medicine, which is caused by self-contained swallowing; or contamination of the food and poisoned livestock by accidental consumption.","daily prevention and proper preservation of the poisonous rat medicine; the area where the bait is placed should be strictly guarded, and the daytime collection; the poisoned birds and livestock must be buried or cremated.","after the enemy rats enter the body, the activity of vitamin k is reduced mainly by competitive inhibition, which hinders the liver from synthesizing prothrombin and some blood coagulation factors, and plays an anticoagulant effect, thus exhibiting bleeding in various parts; this product can damage the capillary in the blood vessel wall, aseptic inflammation changes, which increases the permeability and fragility of the wall and aggravates the bleeding tendency.","['coma', 'bleeding tendency', 'tooth bleeding', 'urine blood', 'hemoptysis', 'stool blood', 'appetite loss', 'sinus', 'abdominal pain', 'hair sputum']",['brain hemorrhage'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
colorectal cancer,"colorectal cancer includes colon cancer and rectal cancer. the incidence of colorectal cancer from high to low is rectal, sigmoid colon, cecum, ascending colon, descending colon and transverse colon. in recent years, there is a tendency to develop proximal (right colon). the mortality rate is located in the third and fourth place of malignant tumor respectively. the 5-year survival rate after surgical resection can reach 40%-60% on average. early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment and standardized surgical treatment are still improved. the key to the efficacy of colorectal cancer.","colorectal cancer is a malignant tumor that seriously threatens human health. the epidemiological survey data from around the world indicate that colorectal cancer ranks third in all kinds of malignant tumors. in recent years, with the development of the economy, the improvement of the living standards of our people and the incidence of colorectal cancer are increasing year by year. therefore, the significance of prevention of colorectal cancer is becoming more and more important. primary prevention reduces, eliminates the pathogenic factors of colorectal cancer, and inhibits the cancerous process of normal cells. 1, dietary adjustment although colorectal cancer has a certain genetic predisposition, but most of the sporadic colorectal cancer is closely related to environmental factors, especially dietary factors, and dietary intervention can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. (1) energy intake energy intake is associated with colorectal cancer. most studies have shown that total energy intake is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer, regardless of whether the energy consumed is protein, fat or carbohydrate, reducing energy. ingestion may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. (2) the occurrence offat and red meatcolorectal cancer is closely related to animal fat and meat. studies have shown that women with high fat injection have a 32% increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with low-fat women, while meat is in the meat. ingestion of red meat is a strong risk factor for colorectal cancer. it is necessary to reduce the amount of fat in food, especially to minimize the brown meat after roasting, which is helpful for colorectal cancer. (3) fruits, vegetables and dietary fiber cellulose can increase the amount of feces, dilute the carcinogen in the colon, and absorb bile salts, which can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. therefore, in the usual diet, you should eat as much vegetables and fruits as possible. , cellulose, a reasonable diet, reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. (4) vitamins and trace elements studies have shown that vitamin a, c, e can make colonic epithelial hyperplasia of adenoma patients into normal, but the current data does not support the use of antioxidant vitamins to prevent colorectal cancer, trace elements and the relationship between colorectal cancer, the current study is not very detailed, folic acid can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, but the specific mechanism is not clear. (5) dietary anti-carcinogen garlic, onion, leeks, leeks, scallions, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks, stalks mutations have anti-cancer effects, especially garlic. studies have shown that garlic is the vegetable with the strongest protective effect and protects people from distal colon cancer. 2, change lifestyle habits (1) obesity and exercise obesity, especially abdominal obesity is an independent risk factor for colorectal cancer, physical activity is too small is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, physical activity can affect colonic peristalsis is conducive to fecal discharge, thereby achieving prevent the role of colorectal cancer. (2) the relationship between smoking and colorectal cancer is not very positive, but smoking is a risk factor for colorectal adenoma. the current study believes that smoking is a stimulating factor for colorectal cancer gene production, but it takes about 40 years. can take effect. (3) alcohol intake of alcohol is related to colorectal cancer. alcohol is also a risk factor for colorectal adenoma, but the specific cause is not clear. reducing alcohol intake is conducive to prevention of colorectal cancer. (4) reproductive factors hormone and reproductive factors may affect the occurrence of colorectal cancer. american studies have shown that the incidence of colorectal cancer in single women is higher than that of married women. some people think that this is related to hormones affecting bile acid metabolism. 3, many epidemiological studies ofdrugs, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the incidence of colorectal cancer is reduced, taking 10 to 15 small doses of aspirin per month, can reduce the relative risk of colorectal cancer by 40%~ 50%, but some studies do not support this statement, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the time of administration, and the side effects caused by long-term application have yet to be further studied. 4, treatment of precancerous lesions patients with colorectal adenoma, ulcerative colitis, the incidence of colorectal cancer increased significantly, through the census and follow-up, early removal of adenoma, treatment of colitis, can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, mortality, especially for family history through genetic testing, screening high-risk groups and performing colonoscopy is an important aspect of colorectal cancer prevention. 5, active exercise: find suitable exercise methods, enhance physical fitness, improve immunity, self-relaxation, relieve stress, maintain a good attitude. secondary prevention of secondary prevention of secondary tumors, ie early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment to prevent or reduce tumor-induced death, colorectal cancer development, is a relatively long process, from precancerous lesions to invasive cancer, estimated it takes 10 to 15 years, which provides an opportunity for census to detect early lesions. early screening for colorectal cancer is an important means of secondary prevention. the third-level prevention of tertiary prevention is effective treatment for cancer patients to improve the quality of life of patients and prolong the survival period. at present, surgical treatment is mainly used for patients with colorectal cancer, supplemented by appropriate radiotherapy and chemotherapy, chinese medicine treatment, and immunotherapy to improve the large intestine. the therapeutic effect of cancer.","the cause is not yet clear and may be related to the following factors. at home and abroad, there are reports of ""colorectal cancer family"". the death of patients with colorectal cancer in blood relatives is significantly higher than that of the average person.some colorectal adenomas, such as multiple-family adenomas, are autosomal dominant hereditary diseases with a prevalence of 50% in the family. if left untreated, they may have colorectal cancer after 10 years of age.recently, some scholars have studied the relationship between tumor suppressor gene and colorectal cancer. it is found that the susceptibility and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer are related to genetic factors. according to local autopsy materials, the incidence of colorectal adenoma is quite consistent with colorectal cancer.it has been estimated that patients with one adenoma have a five-fold higher incidence of colorectal cancer than those without adenoma, and multiple adenomas are twice as likely as single adenomas. ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease are caused by intestinal mucosal destruction, ulcer repair and hyperplasia, carcinogenesis during granulation tissue formation, schistosomiasis eggs are deposited in the rectal mucosa, and chronic inflammation stimulates carcinogenesis. studies have shown that among the various environmental factors, the most important dietary factors, the so-called western diet with high fat, high protein and low cellulose is considered to be associated with rectal cancer.western countries are high-intestinal cancer areas, the incidence of rectal cancer is high, high-fat, high-protein foods can increase the amount of methylcholine in the feces, can cause increased secretion of bile acid, and is decomposed into unsaturated by the anaerobic bacteria in the intestine. hydrocarbons, both of which are carcinogenic.the decrease in the amount of cellulose causes the feces to slow down through the intestinal tract, which increases the contact time between these carcinogens and the intestinal conjunctiva, leading to an increased chance of canceration. in addition, it may be related to the lack of trace elements and changes in living habits.","['abdominal tenderness', 'stationary doctor', 'stool becomes thin like pencil', 'large intestine blackening', 'stool blood', 'planting spread', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation', 'defective column ', 'the stool habits change', 'wasting']",['anemia'],"['oncology', 'oncology']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
large intestine malignant lymphoma,"malignant lymphoma (malignant lymphoma) is a malignant tumor originating from lymphatic reticular tissue. the malignant lymphoma of the large intestine includes extranodal lymphoma originating in the intestine and malignant lymphoma in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. secondary lesions, the origin of the insidious onset, lack of specificity in the early stage, often due to delay in diagnosis and treatment and poor prognosis.occurs in the end of the ileum and the cecum, which is rich in lymphoid tissue, followed by the right colon. the distribution characteristics can be limited, but it is generally more extensive than cancer. the etiology of colorectal malignant lymphoma is unknown, and is mostly related to viruses, immunosuppression, and environmental factors, such as radiation, chemical carcinogenesis, and toxins. common clinical symptoms of colorectal malignant lymphoma include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool, intestinal obstruction, intussusception, and acute peritonitis caused by intestinal perforation.a small number of patients have delayed treatment because of early symptoms. the main method for diagnosing malignant lymphoma of the large intestine is fiberoptic colonoscopy with a high positive rate.in the case of highly suspected malignant lesions under endoscopy, biopsy pathology sometimes only inflammatory cell infiltration, no tumor cells.it may be related to factors such as too shallow material, too small tissue, and extrusion when the tissue is clamped.the malignant lymphoma of the large intestine has certain characteristics in histology. in addition to the mucosa taken during biopsy, the submucosal tissue should be taken. the diagnosis of colorectal malignant lymphoma mainly depends on fiber colonoscopy.colorectal malignant lymphoma should be differentiated from colorectal cancer. their medical history and clinical manifestations are similar. when fiberoptic colonoscopy is indistinguishable, it is often confirmed by biopsy. large intestine malignant lymphoma should adopt a comprehensive treatment plan based on surgery and systemic chemotherapy or traditional chinese medicine. because surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have certain limitations and side effects, it is best to treat chinese medicine with traditional chinese medicine.",there is no effective preventive measure for this disease. early detection and early treatment are the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease.,"the exact cause is unknown and may be related to radiation, chemical carcinogenesis and toxins.","['abdominal tenderness', 'ascites', 'stool blood', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation', 'deterioration of fecal column', 'change in bowel habits']",['ascites'],"['oncology', 'tumor surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

(4) organic neuropathy: spinal tuberculosis, spinal cord tumors, etc. pathogenesis any form of stimulation (physical or chemical) that reaches a certain level of intensity can cause abdominal pain. it is currently believed that in the case of inflammation, tissue necrosis, ischemia, hypoxia, etc., tissue can release some hormones or body fluids to activate pain receptors, causing pain, these substances include acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, bradykinin and its like peptides, prostaglandins, potassium ions, hydrogen ions and acidic products produced during tissue damage, etc. peptides are strong irritants of pain. in addition, these chemicals may also trigger local contraction of smooth muscles and cause pain. 1. the pain receptor is a free nerve ending, distributed in various tissues and organs of the body. the receptors related to pain in the abdominal cavity include: (1) receptors or tension receptors in the wall of the hollow organ, mainly sensing tension, pulling and muscle contraction changes. (2) the serosal membrane, the peritoneal wall layer and the intra-abdominal parenchyma receptor and mesangial receptors, and the mechanical stimulation of stretching, twisting and the like. (3) mucosal receptors, sensing the stimulation of chemical substances, such as gastric acid, intestinal fluid, etc. after the pain receptor is stimulated, the impulse signal transmits the impulse signal to the cerebral cortex through three levels of neurons. grade i neurons (from the abdomen to the spinal cord): the afferent nerves of the abdomen are from the spinal nerves and splanchnic nerves. the former is responsible for the conduction of the abdominal wall, the latter is responsible for the conduction of the visceral sensation, and the painful afferent nerve fibers of the abdominal tissues and organs. the local splanchnic nerve enters the sympathetic chain and rises to a certain segment of the spinal cord. the sensory nerve fibers from the abdominal wall transmit information of pain to the respective neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. class ii neurons (connected to the spinal cord and brainstem): synapses of grade i neurons are in the gray matter at the posterior horn of the spinal cord. after replacement neurons (level ii neurons), the pain information is transferred to the white matter on the opposite side of the spinal cord. and along two pathways: the spinal thalamus bundle and the spinal cord reticular bundle, respectively send information to the thalamus or pons and the medullary reticular formation. class iii neurons (connected to the brainstem and cortex): some neuronal cells in the thalamus receive information from the synapses of the spinal thalamus and transmit them to the somatosensory region of the cerebral cortex, which accepts the neural cells of the reticular structure. information transmitted by synapses of the reticular tract of the spinal cord and transmitted to the frontal and marginal systems. due to the above-mentioned special nerve conduction, the pain of the abdominal and pelvic organs is reflected on the body surface, and often has a certain segmental distribution of the spinal cord. generally speaking, the spinal cord segment that controls the abdominal skin feels from the chest to the waist 1, such as the esophagus. distal, stomach and duodenal proximal, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, its afferent nerve into the spinal cord of the chest 5 ~ chest 9, the abdominal pain caused by these organs mainly between the ventral midline xiphoid and the umbilicus. the small intestine, appendix, ascending colon and transverse colon are 2/3 in the proximal segment, and the afferent spinal cord 8 to chest 11 and waist 1 are mainly expressed around the umbilicus. in addition, most of the organs in the abdomen, such as the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, have bilateral symmetry, and the pain is mostly in the midline of the abdomen; while the nerves of the kidney, ureter, and ovary are mainly distributed on the side, and the abdominal pain is mostly one side. 2. peripheral stimulation is perceived as pain and is affected by different levels of regulation. (1) the intensity of local stimuli needs to exceed the threshold of the receptor. (2) the interaction between intraspinal stimulation and inhibitory factors. in the gray matter in the posterior horn of the spinal cord, there is a spinal cord regulation center, where a nerve cell is called a ""transmission cell"" (t cell), a t cell. the activity becomes a ""valve"" that controls the transmission of pain, directly affecting the transmission of pain information into the gray matter; another cell is called ""intermediary neuron"" (i-cell), which stimulates i cells to inhibit t cell activity. closing the ""valve"" prevents the transmission of pain; inhibiting i cells opens the ""valve"" and accelerates the transmission of pain. (3) internal factors of the cerebral cortex: the nerve fibers of some neurons in the midbrain and cerebral reticular structure can be transmitted to the gray matter in the posterior horn of the spinal cord, releasing some neurotransmitters or hormones, such as releasing endorphins, and activating i. cells that inhibit the transmission of pain, such neurons and their descending nerve fibers are called pain-relieving ""downward suppression systems,"" which exemplify the regulation of low-level nerve centers by the high-level nerve center in pain. 3. from the neural mechanism of pain, abdominal pain can be divided into the following three types: (1) visceral abdominal pain: the pain signal is transmitted through the sympathetic nerve pathway, and the spinal nerves are basically not involved. the characteristics of the pain are: 1 the pain is blurred. , usually more widely shuttled near the midline. 2 the feeling of pain is mostly sputum, discomfort, dull pain or burning. 3 often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sweating and other symptoms of autonomic nervous system excitability, without local muscle tension and skin hypersensitivity. (2) body-induced abdominal pain: also known as ""peritoneal skin reflex pain"", only the body or spinal nerves without the involvement of visceral nerves, pain characteristics: 1 more accurate positioning, often appear in the peritoneal area adjacent to the affected organ, with clear spinal segmental nerve distribution characteristics. 2 degree is intense and continuous. 3 pain can occur on one side of the abdomen and can be aggravated by coughing or changing body position. 4 can be accompanied by local abdominal muscle stiffness, tenderness and rebound tenderness. (3) involvement of pain: refers to the pain caused by the abdominal organs appearing in the area away from the splanchnic nerve conduction of the organ. the visceral nerve and the body nerve participate in such pain mechanism. the pain characteristics: 1 is mostly sharp pain, and the degree is severe. . 2 positions are clearly on one side. 3 local may have muscle tension or skin hyperesthesia.","['postpartum abdominal pain', 'see the eggs in the stool...', 'intestinal', 'muscular fistula or sinus formation', 'resour', 'diarrhea', 'diffuse after eating...' , 'premenstrual knee pain', 'vomiting after strenuous exercise', 'dizziness after strenuous exercise']",['shock'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
peritonitis,"peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneal and visceral peritoneum of the peritoneal wall. it is a serious disease commonly caused by bacterial infection, chemical stimulation or injury.according to the pathogenesis, it can be divided into primary peritonitis and secondary peritonitis, most of which are secondary peritonitis, which originates from abdominal organ infection, necrotic perforation and trauma.its main clinical manifestations are abdominal pain, abdominal muscle tension, as well as nausea, vomiting, fever, severe blood pressure drop and systemic toxic reactions. if not treated promptly, it can die of toxic shock.some patients may have pelvic abscess, intestinal abscess and underarm abscess, axillary abscess and adhesive intestinal obstruction.","most peritonitis can be prevented. common causes of illness such as appendicitis, gastroduodenal ulcer, etc. should be detected early and treated promptly. abdominal surgery should be strictly followed to prevent gastrointestinal fluid spillage to prevent contamination of the abdominal cavity. prevent upper respiratory tract infections during childhood, enhance physical fitness and improve physical resistance.early and appropriate treatment of intra-abdominal inflammatory diseases that may cause peritonitis is a fundamental measure to prevent peritonitis.any abdominal surgery or even abdominal puncture should be strictly performed aseptic operation. oral administration of antibacterial drugs before enteral surgery can reduce the incidence of peritonitis.","primary peritonitis is rarely seen clinically. it refers to the absence of primary lesions in the abdominal cavity. the pathogens are peritonitis caused by infection of the abdominal cavity via blood circulation, lymphatic pathway or female reproductive system.more common in physical weakness, severe liver disease patients or in the case of low disease resistance. secondary peritonitis is the most common acute peritonitis in the clinic, secondary to perforation of organs in the abdominal cavity, rupture of organs, inflammation and surgical contamination.it is a common surgical acute abdomen. its pathological basis is that the peritoneal wall layer and/or visceral layer are stimulated or damaged by various reasons to cause acute inflammatory reaction, which is caused by bacterial infection, chemical stimulation or physical damage.","['shock', 'abdominal discomfort', 'right abdominal pain', 'stationary doctor', 'diffuse umbilical pain', 'diarrhea', 'diffuse mesangial sclerosis', 'abdominal pain', 'nausea']",['dehydration'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
diarrhea,"normal people usually have bowel movements once a day. individuals have 2 or 3 bowel movements per day or once every 2 to 3 days. the faeces have normal traits. the average weight of feces per day is 150-200g, and the water content is 60%-85%. .diarrhea is a common symptom. it means that the frequency of bowel movements is significantly higher than the frequency of usual habits. the faeces are thin, the water is increased, the daily defecation is more than 200g, or the undigested food or pus and mucus, diarrhea is often accompanied. defecation urgency and abdominal discomfort, or anal discomfort, incontinence and other symptoms, diarrhea is divided into acute and chronic.the incidence of acute diarrhea is acute, and the course of disease is within 2 to 3 weeks, rarely exceeding 6 to 8 weeks.chronic diarrhea refers to recurrent diarrhea with a course of at least 4 weeks, often more than 6 to 8 weeks, or intermittent within 2 to 4 weeks.","(1) develop good living habits, pay attention to the hygiene and reasonableness of the diet. (2) guarantee the consumption of clean water. (3) do not eat spoiled food, the raw fruits should be washed. (4) avoid contact and infection between children.","1 bacterial dysentery: more acute onset, often chills, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and sensation after urgency, may be associated with nausea and vomiting, diarrhea characterized by mucus pus and blood, varying times per day, the microscope found that the stool contains a lot of red blood cells , white blood cells, stool culture can be found in shigella. 2 salmonella infection: more than a history of unclean diet, often abdominal distension, abdominal pain and diarrhea symptoms, stools are mainly loose or watery stools, less pus and blood, stool 3 to 5 times a day, stool culture can be pathogenic bacteria (salmonella or salmonella typhimurium, etc.) were found. 3 escherichia coli enteritis: often have a history of unclean diet, acute onset, may have chills, fever and abdominal pain, diarrhea and other symptoms, may be accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, mostly watery stools, but also there are mucus and pus and blood, and the pathogenic bacteria can be found in stool culture. 4 campylobacter intestinal infection: the symptoms are generally mild, manifested as pain in the upper abdomen accompanied by diarrhea, with loose stools or watery stools as the main performance, antibiotic treatment. 5 small intestine, yersinia colonic infection: clinical manifestations are similar to campylobacter infection, diarrhea and other symptoms are often mild. 6 intestinal staphylococcus aureus infection: more acute onset, may have chills, fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea and other symptoms, diarrhea is mainly loose stools, may be accompanied by a small amount of mucus pus and blood, stool culture can establish a diagnosis, the disease it is often found after the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, hormones or major surgery, and staphylococcus aureus can be found in stool culture. 7 acute hemorrhagic necrotizing enterocolitis: now more thought to be associated with clostridium perfringens or clostridium perfringens infection, acute onset, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other symptoms are generally heavier, abdominal pain is more severe and can be spread throughout the abdomen may be persistent pain or paroxysmal aggravation, early diarrhea can be loose stools or watery stools, more than 10 times a day, and then can bring blood, heavy can be bloody, often accompanied by chills, fever, nausea and vomiting, etc., this disease is more common in adolescents. 8 pseudomembranous colitis: occurs after long-term use of antibiotics, can also occur in patients with low immune function, mostly due to intestinal infection caused by clostridium difficile infection, the toxin of the bacteria damage the intestinal mucosa function, the clinical features are more frequent stools, the weight can reach more than 20 times a day, the feces can have mucus pus and blood, and even bloody water samples, sometimes can discharge the pseudo-membrane of egg-like pattern, often accompanied by fever, palpitations, dehydration, electrolyte disorder, hypotension and other symptoms of systemic poisoning, when the stool is used for anaerobic culture, pathogenic bacteria can be found, and metronidazole and vancomycin are effective. 9 cholera: caused by vibrio cholerae infection, clinical manifestations vary in severity, mild symptoms are mild, often watery diarrhea, several times a day, may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and other symptoms; severe stools more, large can be rice soup, patients often have fever, dehydration, hypotension and other systemic poisoning performance, stool culture can find pathogenic bacteria. 1 amoebic dysentery: onset is generally more urgent, often have fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea and other symptoms, diarrhea several times a day to more than 10 times, stool with mucus pus and blood, sometimes stool is dark red or jam-like, the amount is more, stinking, fresh stool examination can be confirmed if amebic trophozoites are found, and metronidazole or tinidazole is effective. 2 acute schistosomiasis: generally occurs in the first time infected with a large number of cercariae cercariae, often chills, fever, bloating, cough, abdominal pain and diarrhea and other symptoms, diarrhea is not serious, ranging from 3 to 5 times a day, can be loose or with mucus, the eosinophils in the peripheral blood are increased. if the patient is repeatedly infected, it is often accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly. 3 piriformis infection: 3 to 5 times a day, mostly for watery stools or loose stools, less mucus, can be diagnosed by finding flagellates in the feces, and metronidazole is effective. 4 trichomoniasis infection: intestinal trichomoniasis infection can also cause diarrhea, stools vary from several times a day, mainly to loose stools, with mucus. more common in intestinal rotavirus infection, intestinal adenovirus infection, clinical symptoms are generally mild, may have abdominal pain, diarrhea, etc., diarrhea varies from several times a day, mainly to loose stools or watery stools. long-term application of antibiotics, hormones or chronically consuming diseases in the middle and late stages, the patient's intestines may develop fungal infections, causing intestinal mucosal congestion, edema, erosion and ulceration leading to diarrhea, manifested as increased stool frequency, lighter is soft it can be accompanied by mucus, several times a day, sometimes the stool is egg-like; in severe cases, it can be mucus pus and blood samples, and the stool can be diagnosed by routine examination to find or culture the fungus. 1 after eating food contaminated with staphylococcus aureus, salmonella, halophilic bacillus or botox, there may be symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration, which is called food poisoning. lean or watery stools, often accompanied by mucus, a few may have pus and blood. 2 taking poisonous cockroaches, puffer fish, larger fish gallbladder and other toxic chemical poisons, such as poisonous rat drugs, pesticides, etc. can occur diarrhea, diarrhea is mainly loose or watery stools, less pus, may be accompanied there are symptoms such as vomiting and abdominal pain. in addition to diarrhea, the above various toxicants have their own special symptoms. such as food allergies (milk, fish, shrimp, seafood products, etc.) can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea; allergic purpura and other diseases can be accompanied by increased intestinal peristalsis and diarrhea, diarrhea is often characterized by thin watery stools, often accompanied by stomach ache. drugs: a variety of drugs can cause diarrhea, such as erythromycin, magnesium hydroxide, neomycin, lincomycin, magnesium sulfate, sorbitol, mannitol, 5-fluorourea, and rifampicin ), propranolol (propranolol), etc., these drugs cause different mechanisms of diarrhea; some chemicals such as phosphorus, arsenic, mercury and alcoholism can cause acute diarrhea, diarrhea often with loose stools and watery samples mainly, often no mucus pus and blood. second, the cause of chronic diarrhea causes many causes of chronic diarrhea. in general, it can be divided into the following seven aspects. clinically, chronic diarrhea is more common, so the characteristics of the disease are briefly explained to identify. (1) intestinal infection: it is the most common cause of chronic diarrhea. 1 bacterial infection: a. chronic bacillary dysentery: acute bacillary dysentery can not be completely cured and can be evolved into chronic, and it can also be acute on a chronic basis. it can be manifested as 3 to 5 times a day in stool, which may be accompanied by mucus, pus and blood. a small number of patients have pain in the left lower abdomen. the positive rate of stool culture in chronic bacillary dysentery is low, generally only 15% to 30%. therefore, pathogens should be found after repeated cultures. b. intestinal tuberculosis: more common in adolescents and young adults, more women than men, the most common site of this disease is the end of the ileum or the right colon. diarrhea is the main symptom of ulcerative intestinal tuberculosis, often alternating with constipation, characterized by diarrhea feces are mushy or watery, ranging from 3 to 5 times a day, and severe cases up to 10 times, often accompanied by fever, night sweats and other symptoms of tuberculosis, x-ray barium enema or colonoscopy can confirm the diagnosis. 2 protozoal and parasitic infections: a. chronic amoebic dysentery (also known as slow-acting amoebic enteritis): stool 3 to 5 times a day, a paste and watery sample, may be accompanied by mucus or blood, typical jam the stool is rare in chronic cases, and the course of disease can be delayed for several months. for several years, the course can be repeated and acute, and the amoebic trophozoites can often be found in fresh feces. b. chronic schistosomiasis: chronic schistosomiasis can occur diarrhea, 3 to 5 times a day, mostly loose stools, may be accompanied by mucus or pus and blood, patients often have schistosomiasis liver fibrosis, the diagnosis depends on serum antibody assays and fecal or rectal mucosal biopsy found eggs. c. piriformis or trichomonas infection: chronic people can have stools several times a day, often for loose stools or watery stools, sometimes with mucus, and can be diagnosed when piriformis or trichomonas is found in the feces. 3 chronic fungal enteritis: often occurs in the long-term use of antibiotics, hormones, but also prone to the late stage of chronic wasting disease, manifested as diarrhea, severe with mucus or pus and blood, and can be repeated, fungus can be found in the stool confirmed diagnosis. in some patients, irritable bowel syndrome can occur after infectious diarrhea. (2) intestinal non-specific inflammation or non-infectious inflammation: 1 chronic non-specific ulcerative colitis: it is considered to be an autoimmune disease. in recent years, there has been an increasing trend in china. it occurs in young and middle-aged people. the lesion mainly invades the rectum, sigmoid colon and descending colon, and can also invade the right colon. for light, heavy and outbreak type 3, the lightest type is the most common, the lighter is 3 to 4 times a day, and the heavy one can reach more than 10 times. the stool is mushy or loose, often mixed with mucus pus and blood, and the heavy one is only discharged. mucus pus and no faecal, often accompanied by abdominal pain, urgency and other symptoms, a small number of cases may have joint pain and other extraintestinal symptoms, x-ray barium enema and colonoscopy is very helpful in the diagnosis, the disease in the onset of symptoms, after treatment, it can generally be controlled to make the disease in a remission period, and if it is not maintained, it can relapse. 2crohn disease (crohn's disease): it is also an autoimmune disease. it is far less common in europe than in europe and america. it occurs in young adults. the lesion can invade the whole digestive tract, but it is more common in the ileum and its adjacent cecum. the characteristics of diarrhea are 3 to 6 times of stool every day, mostly mushy or loose stools, and there are few mucus pus and blood; there is often tenderness in the right lower abdomen, sometimes the lower right abdomen can be paralyzed and mass, and a few patients may have arthritis, etc. extraintestinal manifestations, x-ray barium enema and colonoscopy are helpful for diagnosis. the disease also has the characteristics of symptom onset and relief, and the disease can be prolonged for many years. 3 chronic radiation enteritis: patients with cervical cancer or pelvic malignant tumors, if diarrhea occurs within weeks or months after receiving radiation therapy, the possibility of radiation enteritis should be considered, mainly manifested as mucus and bloody stools, often accompanied by urgency and heavy, and there is pain in the rectum. colonoscopy may show that the mucosa of the lesion (the mucosa damaged after radiotherapy) is hyperemia, erosion or oozing, and the disease may last for many years without healing. (3) absorptive syndrome: the classification of malabsorption syndrome is very complicated. malabsorption can be caused by stomach and small bowel diseases, and can also be caused by liver and gallbladder and pancreatic diseases. 1 primary malabsorption: a. tropical steatorrhea: also known as tropical stomatitis diarrhea, occurs in the tropics, the cause is still unknown, generally considered to be related to protein, folic acid and b vitamin deficiency, diarrhea it is characterized by a large amount of feces and a stench, and about one-third of patients present with steatorrhea. b. nontropic steatorrhea: also known as glial intestinal disease, primary steatorrhea or celiac disease, the patient's intestinal mucosa lacks a peptide-degrading enzyme, so it can not be decomposed and toxic. alpha-glycoprotein, alpha-glycoprotein has a detrimental effect on intestinal villi and intestinal epithelial cells, eventually leading to malabsorption (barley, wheat and oats contain alpha-glycoprotein), diarrhea is characterized by steatorrhea, and the amount of feces is it is oily and smelly, and stools vary from several times a day. 2 secondary malabsorption: a. after gastrectomy: more common after total gastrectomy and biro ii surgery, because the food quickly enters the small intestine, causing insufficient secretion of enterokinase, pancreatic digestive enzymes and bile, or pancreatic juice bile insufficient mixing with food can cause malabsorption and cause diarrhea. in addition, if gastrointestinal surgery causes bacterial overgrowth (blindness syndrome), the formation of micelles may be affected by bacterial decomposition and bile salts. causes steatorrhea. b. chronic hepatobiliary diseases: such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and intrahepatic bile duct obstruction, etc., due to the lack of bile salts, fat can not be emulsified and transported, it can lead to steatorrhea. c. intestinal disease: excessive small bowel resection (such as short bowel syndrome when the small intestine is removed more than 75% of the total length or only 120cm remaining), stomach, colon fistula or stomach, ileal fistula can be due to the absorption area of the small intestine decrease, or food that passes through the small intestine or jejunum and through the fistula to the colon, can eventually lead to diarrhea. d. chronic pancreatic diseases: such as chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, etc., due to insufficient pancreatic secretion, pancreatic enzyme deficiency caused by fat and protein digestion and absorption disorders and cause diarrhea. e. small intestinal mucosal diffuse lesions: such as small intestine malignant lymphoma, whipple disease, etc., due to intestinal mucosal damage and lymphatic vessel dilatation or obstruction and other factors leading to steatorrhea; scleroderma, due to gastrointestinal mucosa and submucosa atrophy can eventually cause digestive dysfunction and lead to diarrhea. (4) endocrine diseases: many endocrine diseases are associated with symptoms of diarrhea. patients may sometimes be diagnosed in the department of gastroenterology due to diarrhea, so they must be identified. 1 hyperthyroidism: 10% to 15% of patients with hyperthyroidism have diarrhea, but diarrhea is generally not serious, several times a day, mostly soft stool or watery stool, no mucus pus and blood, less abdominal pain, patients often have more sweat, heart palpitations, weight loss, goiter and exophthalmos. 2 diabetes: the cause of diarrhea is related to pancreatic exocrine dysfunction and intestinal motility dysfunction. diarrhea can be soft stool or watery stool, or it can be steatorrhea, often no mucus pus and blood, several times a day, a few patients can it is characterized by intractable diarrhea. 3 hypoparathyroidism and medullary thyroid tumor: the former may cause neuro-muscle stress-induced diarrhea due to hypocalcemia, but diarrhea is generally not serious, ranging from 2 to 3 times a day, the latter is due to the tumor releases calcitonin and causes diarrhea. 4 adrenal insufficiency: when the adrenal cortical function is low, it can cause the secretion of gastric acid and pepsin, and often accompanied by intestinal absorption dysfunction, it can occur diarrhea, often mushy, not many times. 5 pancreatic cholera syndrome (also known as verner-morrison syndrome, wdha syndrome, watery diarrhea - hypokalemia - no gastric acid syndrome or vasoactive intestinal peptide tumor, namely vipoma): this disease is rare, there are scattered cases reported in the country, this disease is caused by abnormal secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) in tumor cells. it is believed that the vip of adult patients is mostly from islet cell tumor, while the vip of children is mostly from ganglioneuroma or ganglion neuroblastoma. the clinical features are watery diarrhea, low potassium and true no gastric acid (reported cases have normal gastric acid secretion), the diagnosis depends on vip measurement, b-ultrasound, ct or mri examination found tumor. 6 gastrinoma (zollinger-ellison syndrome, zhuo-ehrlich syndrome): due to the secretion of a large number of gastrin from pancreatic islet non-汕-cell tumor, a large number of gastrin stimulated parietal cells to secrete a large amount of gastric acid, diarrhea and a large number gastric acid and gastric juice secretion, the disease is often accompanied by stomach, duodenal multiple ulcer formation, diagnosis depends on gastric juice analysis, gastrin level determination and b-ultrasound, ct or mri examination of the tumor (the tumor is mostly located in the pancreatic tissue a few are located in other parts of the abdominal cavity). (5) neoplastic diseases: there are the following benign or malignant tumors. 1 gastrointestinal malignant lymphoma: the most invasive part of gastrointestinal lymphoma is the ileum, which is less affected by the colon. in addition to diarrhea, it is often accompanied by abdominal pain or abdominal mass. a few patients can have bloody stools as the main performance. 2 type of cancer syndrome: diarrhea and serotonin secreted by carcinoid cells, bradykinin and serotonin and other vascular active substances, carcinogenesis is most common in the appendix, other parts of the intestine can also occur, except diarrhea patients often have paroxysmal redness in the face or neck or upper body (also known as ""redness""), and a few are accompanied by bronchial asthma symptoms. 3 colon cancer: middle and late rectal or sigmoid colon cancer may have mucus pus and bloody stool, and with pain in the left lower abdomen and urgency, diarrhea is an important symptom of right colon cancer, often manifested as loose stool or mushy stool, no obvious mucus pus (but there are often red blood cells and pus cells under the microscope). patients are usually accompanied by abdominal pain, weight loss and anemia. the left colon cancer is mainly caused by secret or chronic intestinal obstruction, but if there is infection or cancer rupture, it is characterized by pus and blood. 4 intestinal adenomatous polyps or polyposis: may be due to surface bleeding, erosion or ulceration of polyps leading to secretory diarrhea, in addition to diarrhea, blood is also one of the important symptoms of intestinal polyps. (6) gastrointestinal dysfunction disease: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), ibs is a group of intestinal dysfunction syndrome consisting of abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain accompanied by abnormal bowel movements, the patient's intestine there are no organic lesions or abnormal biochemical indicators. the formerly referred to as mucinous colitis, irritating colon or allergic colitis are now collectively referred to as ibs. the occurrence of this disease is often associated with mental stress and emotional excitement. relationship, that is, mental and psychological factors have an important impact on the onset of disease. in addition, stress and/or intestinal infections (such as dysentery, enteritis, etc.) are often an important cause of ibs, and in recent years, the incidence of ibs has been studied intensively. ibs is considered to have visceral paresthesia, and the sensitivity of the colon to stimulation is increased to cause abnormal bowel movements (diarrhea or constipation or diarrhea constipation alternately). in 2000, the latest diagnostic standard for ibs, the rome ii standard, was issued internationally. : 1 diagnosis: this disease first needs to rule out the explanation of the symptoms of tissue structure or biochemical abnormalities. at least 3 months in 21 years, there are repeated abdominal pain or abdominal discomfort accompanied by 2 of the following 3 bowel movement abnormalities. a. the abdominal pain is relieved or relieved after the operation. b. the frequency of defecation is abnormal (ie >3 times/d or <3 times/week). c. abnormal bowel shape (lean or dry hard), the rome ii standard is gradually accepted by multinational gastroenterologists, diarrhea-type ibs patients often have diarrhea after abdominal pain or discomfort, and then abdominal pain or discomfort relieved or relieved, the stool is characterized by loose stools, soft stools, a few watery stools, the number of times per day, often more than 3 times, feces without pus, a few may be accompanied by mucus, chinese medicine diagnosis is ""five diarrhea, can be considered as a manifestation of ibs, patients often have abdominal pain or abdominal discomfort before dawn, most have bowel sounds hyperthyroidism, pain relief or relief after abdominal pain, generally diarrhea 2 to 3 times before breakfast after breakfast, diarrhea can often stop, and a few patients are prone to abdominal pain and diarrhea after each meal. this is because the stomach-colon reflex is caused by eating, that is, after the stomach contains food, it causes colonic hyperactivity and the patient has abdomen. hidden pain or discomfort, followed by a sense of convenience, this performance should also be considered to be caused by colonic dysfunction. (7) other factors: 1 intestinal flora imbalance: diarrhea is caused by the long-term application of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which causes the normal flora of the intestine to be disordered. in severe cases, pseudomembranous colitis can be induced. 2 uremia: diarrhea caused by uremic enteritis, stool 3 to 5 times a day, mostly mushy or watery stool. the mechanism of diarrhea caused by pathogenesis is very complicated. a diarrheal disease often involves multiple factors. generally, the pathogenesis of diarrhea is divided into the following four categories according to pathophysiology. 1. abnormal secretion function diarrhea caused by abnormal secretion function is also called secretory diarrhea or exudative diarrhea. the normal intestinal mucosa has the function of secretion and absorption, and regulates the absorption of water, nutrients and electrolytes, and the water lost from the feces. basically stable, when the intestinal secretion function exceeds its absorption function, it will inevitably lead to diarrhea, escherichia coli endotoxin, vibrio cholerae or clostridium difficile endotoxin caused by a large amount of watery diarrhea is intestinal secretion or a typical representative of exudative diarrhea, the mechanism is that endotoxin first binds to receptors on the brush border of epithelial cells, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase in intestinal mucosal cells, allowing intracellular second messenger camp (loop) adenosine phosphate), cgmp (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) and calcium ions increase, which in turn increases the intracellular water and chlorine secretion into the intestinal lumen, up to 1 ~ 2l per hour, after clostridium difficile infection through ca increased secretion of diarrhea, a large amount of fluid can not be absorbed by the small intestine and large intestine mucosa, it will inevitably lead to diarrhea, other diseases such as gastrinoma (zollinger-ellison syndrome), vasoactive intestinal peptide tumor (vipoma), diarrhea caused by pancreatic cholera syndrome, etc. is also secretory diarrhea, in addition, intestinal infectious and non-infectious inflammation (such as dysentery bacillus, salmonella, mycobacterium tuberculosis, amoeba, yell sennis and viruses, fungal infections, non-specific ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease, radiation intestinal damage, etc.) are diarrhea caused by increased intestinal secretion. 2. increased osmotic pressure due to theincreaseofosmotic pressure inthe intestinal lumen, diarrhea is also called osmotic diarrhea or hypertonic diarrhea. in normal people, food decomposition products such as sugar, fat, protein and electrolytes are in under the action of chylomicrons, small intestinal kinase and various pancreatic enzymes, it has been absorbed or diluted. therefore, the contents of the ileum are isotonic. if empty, the contents of the ileum are hyperosmotic, that is, infiltration in the intestinal lumen. when the pressure is increased, the osmotic pressure between the plasma and the contents of the intestinal cavity will be different. when the osmotic pressure difference between the two increases, in order to maintain the osmotic pressure gradient, the water in the plasma will quickly pass through the intestine. the mucous membrane enters the intestinal lumen until the contents of the intestinal lumen are diluted to isotonic, and a large amount of fluid in the intestinal lumen can cause diarrhea. when pancreatic lesions (such as chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cystic fibrosis, etc.) or hepatobiliary lesions (chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, biliary calculi, biliary tract inflammation and biliary tract tumors, etc.), due to lack of various digestion enzyme or fat emulsification disorders can cause sugar, fat and protein in the empty, ileal digestion, absorption disorders, so that the contents of the intestinal cavity in a hypertonic state, it will inevitably lead to diarrhea, in a few cases, severe atrophic gastritis or invasive gastric cancer due to decreased gastric juice and gastric acid secretion, food digestion in the stomach is weakened, food will directly enter the small intestine and lead to increased intestinal osmotic pressure, can also cause diarrhea, lactose caused by congenital lactase deficiency malabsorption is not uncommon in china. among them, about 60% of the enzyme-deficient patients may develop symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain after eating milk or dairy products. these patients are intolerant to lactose, and the undigested lactose in the intestine passes through the intestines. bacterial glycolysis produces a large amount of gas such as carbon dioxide, and the decomposed lactic acid and other short-chain organic acids cause an increase in intestinal osmotic pressure, thus causing the diarrhea is also hyperosmotic diarrhea. in addition, diarrhea caused by certain drugs such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, mannitol, sorbitol and lactulose is also hyperosmotic diarrhea. 3. absorption dysfunction diarrhea caused by malabsorption of nutrients is also called malabsorption diarrhea, and various diseases that cause intestinal mucosal damage or reduced absorption area can cause diarrhea; intestinal infectious and non-infectious diseases can cause damage to intestinal mucosa. that is, the microvilli on the surface of the small intestine mucosa may be destroyed, resulting in a decrease in the absorption area and diarrhea; a significant reduction in the absorption area after most of the intestines may cause diarrhea; pediatric celiac disease, tropical and non-tropical steatorrhea (wheat gum) intestinal disease), etc. due to the reduction of microvilli in the small intestine, atrophy, resulting in decreased absorption area and diarrhea; in addition, mesenteric vascular or lymphatic lesions (such as obstruction, reflux obstruction, etc.) can also cause malabsorption diarrhea; high pressure (causal hypertensive gastric mucosal lesions), right heart dysfunction or constrictive pericarditis, if not treated promptly, can cause gastrointestinal mucosal congestion, resulting in intestinal mucosal absorption disorders leading to diarrhea in addition, under normal circumstances, the combined bile salt reabsorbs at the end of the ileum and reaches the liver (intestinal hepatic circulation), such as severe lesions at the end of the ileum, such as the intestine after the extensive resection of the nucleus, crohn's disease, tumor or ileum end, the combined absorption of bile salts is reduced, and the bound bile salts entering the colon are significantly increased, which can be decomposed into bischolic acid by colonic bacteria, which stimulates the secretion of colonic mucosa. and water, salt absorption decreases and causes diarrhea. 4. gastrointestinal motor dysfunction diarrhea caused by gastrointestinal dysfunction is also called abnormal motor function diarrhea, functional diarrhea or hyperactive diarrhea, when the gastrointestinal tract is increased, eat the residence time of phlegm and water in the gastrointestinal tract is shortened, resulting in incomplete absorption and diarrhea; intestinal inflammation, infectious lesions can stimulate the intestinal wall, increase intestinal motility and aggravate diarrhea, and some patients have anxiety and emotional stress. also associated with abdominal pain and diarrhea, commonly known as irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), the main cause of diarrhea is intestinal dysfunction or hyperreflexia of the stomach-colon, in addition, some endocrine diseases such as hyperthyroidism diarrhea can also occur in diabetes, etc. the cause is also related to hypermotility of the intestines; when the peristalsis is too slow and the chyme stays in the intestine for too long, such as causing excessive bacterial growth, it can also cause diarrhea. lol, mosapride and other drugs can cause diarrhea when the intestinal peristalsis increases.","['bacterial infection', 'incremental absorption of water in the intestines', 'inspected eggs in the feces...', 'in the case of urgency and heavy',

reflux esophagitis,"refluxesophagitis (re) refers to a series of syndromes such as acid reflux, heartburn, and esophageal inflammation caused by the reverse flow of stomach and/or duodenal contents into the esophagus.gastroesophageal reflux is divided into physiological and pathological.physiological gastroesophageal reflux is seen in normal people and has no clinical significance. if reflux occurs more frequently than normal people, it can not remove acidic digestive gastric juice and pepsin, bile, pancreatic juice in time, it will cause inflammation, erosion, ulcer and esophageal mucosa. lesions such as fibrosis belong to gastroesophaeal reflux disease (gerd).symptoms of reflux esophagitis are easily confused with peptic ulcer and are easily misdiagnosed.","1, obese people should lose weight, because obese people with increased abdominal pressure, can promote gastric reflux, especially in the supine position, should actively reduce weight to improve reflux symptoms. 2, to maintain a comfortable mood, increase the appropriate physical exercise. 3, bed at the end should be raised by 10 cm ~ 15 cm overall, is a effective way to reduce nighttime reflux.","24-hour esophageal ph monitoring found that the normal population has gastro-esophageal reflux (ger) phenomenon, but without any clinical symptoms, it is called physiological ger, which is characterized by: often occurring during the day and rare at night; there is more reflux during meals or after meals; total reflux time <hours/24 hours, physiological ger can be converted into pathological ger and even developed into reflux esophagitis under the following conditions. the anti-reflux barrier of the esophagogastric junction is also known as the first anti-reflux screen. the most important structure is the lower esophageal sphincter (les). the les is within 3 to 5 cm above the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. in the high-pressure area, the resting pressure is about 2.0-4.0 kpa (15-30 mmhg), which constitutes a pressure barrier and plays a physiological role in preventing the stomach contents from flowing back into the esophagus. the increase of normal intra-abdominal pressure can cause les through the vagus nerve. contraction reflex, which makes the les increase in multiples to prevent ger, les low pressure and increased intra-abdominal pressure can not cause a strong les contraction reaction, can lead to ger, studies have shown that lesd <0.8kpa, it is easy to reverse flow, about 17% to 39% of ger in patients with reflux esophagitis, cholinergic and 汕-adrenergic analog drugs, 汐-adrenergic antagonists, dopaan, diazepam, calcium receptor antagonists, morphine and fat, alcohol, caffeine and smoking, and other food factors can affect les function, induce ger, in addition, during pregnancy, oral progesterone-containing contraceptive period and late menstrual cycle, plasma progesterone levels increase, the incidence of ger also increase accordingly. normal esophageal acid clearance function includes esophageal emptying and saliva neutralization. when the acidic stomach contents are refluxed, it only takes 1 or 2 times (about 10 to 15 seconds) to egress the esophagus and emptied almost everywhere. all the reflux, a small amount of acid remaining in the esophageal mucosa, can be neutralized by saliva (normal humans about 1000-1500 ml per hour, ph 6-8 saliva through the esophagus into the stomach), esophageal acid clearance the function is to reduce the time limit of esophageal mucosa immersion in gastric acid, so it has the effect of preventing reflux esophagitis. it is found that most of the esophageal emptying abnormalities occur early in esophagitis, but it is rare to have esophagitis caused by decreased salivation. salivation is almost stopped during nighttime sleep, and secondary peristalsis of the esophagus is rare. the nighttime esophageal acid clearance is obviously delayed, so the nighttime ger is more serious. the anti-reflux barrier function of the esophageal mucosa consists of the following factors: 1 pre-epithelial factors including mucus layer, hco-3 concentration on mucosal surface; 2 epithelial factors including epithelial cell membrane and intercellular junction structure, and epithelial transport, intracellular buffer , cell metabolism and other functions; 3 post-epithelial factors refer to the internal basal acid status and blood supply of the tissue, when the above-mentioned defensive barrier is damaged, even in the case of normal reflux, can also cause esophagitis, the study found that esophageal epithelium the weakening of cell proliferation and repair ability is one of the important reasons for the development of reflux esophagitis. 1. abnormal gastric emptying: the incidence of delayed gastric emptying in patients with reflux esophagitis is above 40%, but the causal relationship between the two is still controversial. 2, gastroduodenal reflux: under normal circumstances, esophageal squamous epithelial cells have a keratinized surface layer, can prevent h + infiltration into the mucosa, to protect the esophageal mucosal surface from acid reflux, when the pyloric sphincter tension and when the les pressure is low, the hydrochloric acid and pepsin in the gastric juice, the bile acid in the duodenal juice, the pancreatic juice and the hemolytic lecithin can simultaneously flow back into the esophagus, erode the keratinized layer of the esophageal epithelial cells, and change it. thin or shedding, h+ and pepsin in the reflux penetrate deep into the esophageal tissue through the layer of newborn squamous epithelial cells, causing esophagitis. commonly, the sliding sputum, the esophagus and stomach joints are displaced upwards into the chest cavity with the stomach body. the rise of the corpuscles separates the squats, the holes are enlarged, the sacs are small, and the sacs are moved up and down with the body position, force and cough. no longer sliding, changing the normal anatomical relationship near the hole, causing the esophagogastric junction to be incompletely closed. the invasion of the stomach causes the his-angle of the esophagus to enter the stomach to disappear, the esophageal membrane is elongated, thinned, and the esophagus of the abdominal segment moves up. the closing function of the joint is further deteriorated, and more than half of the patients with hiatal hernia develop reflux esophagitis. disruptive esophagitis can occur after surgery, such as vagus nerve ablation, lower esophageal myotomy, major gastrectomy, etc. inserting the stomach tube can cause the esophagitis to be completely closed, but the cause can be recovered after the cause is removed. pregnancy vomiting: the hiatal hernia caused by increased intra-abdominal pressure during pregnancy can cause reflux esophagitis, but it can be recovered after delivery without any treatment. vomiting and long-term hiccup can also cause the sputum to open frequently and cause reflux esophagus. inflammation, it can return to normal after removing the cause. other diseases: neonatal and infants develop regurgitation due to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter. most of them can be relieved with the development of young children. there is still a dysfunction of the primary esophageal sphincter, which causes insufficiency. organic diseases such as tumors in the lower esophagus and cardia, scleroderma and various pyloric obstructions can cause reflux esophagitis. therefore, reflux esophagitis is usually the result of reflux bile and gastric acid in the esophageal mucosa, and pyloric and les dysfunction must exist before bile-induced esophageal injury; reflux esophagitis is often accompanied by gastritis sliding esophageal hiatal hernia is often complicated by les and pyloric dysfunction. duodenal ulcer is associated with high gastric acid secretion and is easy to cause antrum and pyloric dysfunction. obesity, a large amount of ascites, late pregnancy, increased intragastric pressure and other factors can induce this disease. pathogenesis under normal physiological conditions, the tubular esophagus enters the gastric sac and is inclined to the right side at an angle called his angle. the stomach bottom is pushed to the esophagus to act as a flap, mechanically preventing the reflux of the gastroesophageal tube, and the mucosa at the entrance of the esophagus at the cardia is gathered more. and the high pressure area under the esophagus is also an important factor to prevent reflux. these normal anatomical relationships play a role in preventing gastroesophageal reflux, destroying the mechanism of preventing gastroesophageal reflux, and incomplete closure of the esophagus and stomach joints will result in frequent reflux. there are different opinions on gastroesophageal reflux. it is generally believed that the esophageal membrane attachment point of patients with gastroesophageal reflux is lower than that of normal people. the esophageal segment of the abdomen is short or disappears, so that the whole esophageal segment is subjected to a subatmospheric negative pressure. the esophageal lumen is enlarged and reflux occurs. another mechanism that may cause reflux is that the tension of the esophageal membrane is increased, so that the distal end of the esophagus is often pulled and opened. the reflux occurs often in patients with abnormal body weight or excessive exertion or posture. at that time, for example, obesity patients had more fat in the esophageal membrane area, which reduced the length of attachment to the esophageal ventral section. people with heavy smoking and drinking had non-specific esophagitis, which caused adhesion between the esophageal membrane and the distal esophagus. the length of the esophagus in the abdomen is reduced, and the above assumptions all involve an abnormality of the esophageal membrane. the reflux is physiological to a certain extent. if it is accompanied by esophagitis, it becomes pathological. the long-term exposure of the esophageal epithelium to the reflux of gastric acid is the cause of esophagitis. the duration of contact between the esophageal mucosa and gastric acid is determined by reflux. frequency and duration of each reflux, and the speed of acid removal by the esophagus, continuous monitoring of the ph value of the esophagus after 24h, the normal value is 5.0 ~ 6.8, the ph value below 4.0 is considered to be the presence of reflux, because ph 1.8 ~ 3.8 is the upper limit of the most appropriate activity of protease, in the upright position and awake state, due to gravity removal and swallowing action and neutral saliva neutralization, normal people's reflux does not cause damage, frequent reflux especially in the supine and deep sleep, the esophagus has no activity, although the reflux is small, but the removal is slow, there is no gravity to help clear, and there is no neutralization of saliva, so the incidence of reflux esophagitis is high, the reflux in addition to food, gastric juice contains acid, protease and mucus, plus bile salts, pancreatic enzyme is extremely sensitive to esophageal mucosa, can occur esophagitis or esophageal function changes, or both, the above factors, reflux, promote the occurrence of esophagitis. in patients with chronic reflux, the mucosa of the ulcer is healed, the neoplastic epithelium is replaced by the columnar epithelium of the esophagogastric junction, and the columnar epithelium at the upper end of the cardia is called barrett's esophagus or columnar epithelium. if there is persistent reflux, the squamous epithelium ulcers can occur at the junction and there is a high risk of developing adenocarcinoma.","['anti-gastric', 'intestinal flatulence', 'heartburning pain', 'boiled heart', 'hypothesis', 'esophageal sputum', 'choking pain']",['esophageal perforation'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']",['surgical treatment']
salmonella food poisoning,"salmonella food poisoning is a common bacterial food poisoning, consisting of a group of gram-negative bacilli, especially those that cause disease in humans and animals, with typhoid fever, enteritis and cholera cholerae being the most common.the main cause of poisoning is that the food is contaminated and propagated by salmonella, and improper handling fails to kill salmonella.when processing contaminated pork and internal organs, often due to insufficient heating or dicing, there are still viable bacteria in the center of the food, which can cause poisoning after eating.","1. cook, cook, store, and separate raw and cooked foods when eating. 2. prevent nosocomial infections.the hospital is especially the delivery room.pediatric wards and infectious disease wards should prevent epidemics in the ward.once found.to be completely disinfected.","the main cause of poisoning is that the food is contaminated and propagated by salmonella, and improper handling fails to kill salmonella.when processing contaminated pork and internal organs, often due to insufficient heating or dicing, there are still viable bacteria in the center of the food, which can cause poisoning after eating.in addition, in the diseased milk, if the heating is not complete, it can be poisoned.raw and cooked meat is infected again during processing and storage, such as knives, cutting boards and storage containers.although the disease can occur throughout the year, most of it occurs between may and october, with the most from july to august. it can also cause poisoning through contaminated food and water sources such as flies and rodents.the pathogenesis of salmonella is mainly due to the large amount of live salmonella entering the digestive tract with food and breeding in the intestine, and then enters the blood circulation through the mesenteric lymphoid tissue, causing bacteremia and causing systemic infection.when the bacteria are destroyed by the mesentery, lymph nodes and reticuloendothelial cells, the salmonella releases endotoxin, which causes human poisoning and subsequent clinical symptoms.","['diarrhea', 'abdominal pain', 'jidue fever', 'disgusting', 'relaxing heat']",['septicemia'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
radiation enteritis,"radiation enteritis is a gastrointestinal complication caused by radiotherapy in pelvic, abdominal, and retroperitoneal malignancies.it can affect the small intestine, colon and rectum, so it is also called radioactive rectum, colon, and small intestine.in the early stage of intestinal mucosal cell renewal is inhibited, after the small arterial wall is swollen, occluded, causing intestinal wall ischemia, mucosal erosion, fibrosis caused by late intestinal wall, narrow or perforated intestinal lumen, abscess formation in the abdominal cavity, fistula and intestinal adhesions, etc. .","foods that consume more cellulose or are irritating to the intestinal wall should be avoided. foods with less slag, low fat and less gas production should be eaten.such as carrots, spinach, etc., both intestines and vitamins.also pay attention to keeping the anus and perineum clean and wearing loose underwear.in severe cases, radiotherapy can be suspended, and high-dose vitamins and infusions can be used to supplement various intravenous nutrition and use of adrenal cortical hormones and antibiotics to alleviate local inflammatory reactions and promote recovery.","intestinal mucosal epithelial cells are most sensitive to radiation. the thymidine-labeled thymidine is used for cell renewal observation. it is found that the regeneration of intestinal mucosa is completed by the proliferation of undifferentiated cells located in the crypt of the intestinal gland.these cells lose their ability to divide after differentiation and gradually move to the surface of the intestinal mucosa.radiation inhibits the proliferation of these cells, causing characteristic acute lesions in the intestinal mucosa.if the radiation dose is not excessive, mucosal damage can be restored 1 to 2 weeks after stopping the radiation therapy.recent studies have found that the effect of multiple exposures depends on the cell cycle in which the crypt cells are exposed. cells in the late stage of division are most sensitive to radiation, while cells synthesized in the late stage are more tolerant, at any given time. only a portion of all proliferating crypt cells are in a certain phase of the cell proliferation cycle, so a single high-dose irradiation only kills a portion of the cells, and after a few days the cells undergo mitosis and return to normal. the endothelial cells of the small arteries are very sensitive to radiation. high-dose radiation therapy causes the cells to swell, proliferate, and fibrillar, causing occlusive endarteritis and endometritis.therefore, intestinal wall ischemia and mucosal erosion and ulceration occur, and bacterial invasion in the intestinal tract further develops the lesion. intestinal wall tissue caused by edema after extensive continuous irradiation, fibroblast proliferation in all layers of the intestinal wall, connective tissue and smooth muscle showed a transparent change, and finally led to fibrosis, intestinal stenosis, mucosal surface distortion and fracture, so the radiation produced intestine changes in the path can vary from reversible mucosal structure to chronic fiber thickening, accompanied by ulcerated intestines, and even intestinal obstruction.","['resident doctor', 'diarrhea', 'weakness', 'low fever', 'disgusting', 'wasting']",['rectung cancer'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
formalin poisoning,"formalin is a 35% to 40% formaldehyde solution. it is an important disinfectant and preservative. it has a strong stimulating effect on the skin and mucous membranes. it has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system after absorption. the formaldehyde is oxidized to form formic acid in the body. , often lead to acidosis, that is, formalin poisoning.formalin should not be exposed to strong oxidants, strong bases, phenols, urea, etc., which may cause chemical reactions.","in the production process, if formaldehyde vapor escapes, it should be sealed, formaldehyde infusion should be mechanized, and a local exhaust hood should be installed to enhance the ventilation of the workplace.store the formaldehyde container, and pay attention to sealing and capping.wear overalls during work to prevent formaldehyde from splashing on your skin.wear respirators and masks when necessary.perform regular physical examinations.pay attention to personal hygiene, shower and change clothes after work.","formalin is a trade name and is commonly used in fumigation of poultry houses, hatcheries, incubators, eggs and hatchers, and shelled chicks.inadvertent or direct contact with formalin during operation can cause formalin poisoning. its chemical composition is formaldehyde, which often causes poisoning when used improperly.it is mainly caused by the fact that the concentration of the formalin is too high or the action time is too long.pay attention to dosage and self-protection when using.","['coma', 'respiratory failure', 'diarrhea', 'abdominal pain', 'disgusting', 'stunning']",['shock'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
germinated potato poisoning,"potato (solanumtuberosum), commonly known as potato or yam, is a solanaceae, immature or germinated root contains toxic substances: solanine, toxic solanine and so on.the poisoning component is solanine (c45h73o15n), also known as potato toxin, which is a weakly alkaline indole alkaloid, also known as solanum nigrum, soluble in water. it is easily decomposed in the presence of acetic acid, high in heat, and can be detoxified by boiling. .solanum sinensis is corrosive, hemolyzed, and has paralytic effects on the motor center and respiratory center.each 100g potato contains only 5-10mg of solanum nigrum; the immature, cautious potato or sprouted potato contains solanum nigrum increased to 25-60mg, even up to 430mg.therefore, eating a large amount of immature or sprouted potatoes can cause acute poisoning.after acute poisoning, there are gastrointestinal symptoms first. lighter ones can heal themselves. in severe cases, electrolyte imbalance can occur. severe poisoning is initially disturbed and disturbed. later, there may be coma and convulsions, which may eventually lead to death due to paralysis of the respiratory center.","daily prevention of potatoes should be stored at low temperature, avoiding sunlight, preventing sprouting, not eating too much sprouts, black-green skinned potatoes, potatoes with less sprouts should completely dig the buds of the buds, and cut off the skin around the buds. in part, this potato is not easy to fry, should be boiled, stewed, braised, and vinegar when cooked, can accelerate the destruction of solanine.","when the potato is stored improperly, when the potato sprouts or partially turns green, the solanine is greatly increased, and the solanine is not removed or destroyed during cooking, and poisoning occurs after eating, especially in the late spring and early summer. the solanine is the toxic component in the germinated potato. the potato contains less solanine in normal conditions and gradually increases during storage. however, after the germination of the potato, the content of solanine in the shoots and buds of the potato increases sharply. it can cause poisoning. solanine has a strong stimulating effect on the gastrointestinal mucosa, has a paralyzing effect on the respiratory center, and can cause cerebral edema and congestion. in addition, it has a hemolysis effect on red blood cells.","['coma', 'breathing difficulties', 'diarrhea', 'abdominal pain', 'twitching', 'disgusting']",['respiratory failure'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
vibrio parahaemolyticus food poisoning,"vibrio parahaemolyticus food poisoning (also known as food poisoning) is an acute, subacute disease that occurs after eating food contaminated with the bacteria or eating food containing the bacteria.vibrio parahaemolyticus is a common food poisoning pathogen, accounting for a large proportion of bacterial food poisoning. clinically, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and watery stools are the main symptoms.the food poisoning caused by the bacteria has a violent disease (the same time, the same area, the same or similar symptoms, the same contaminated food), a short incubation period (hours to several days), a certain seasonal (multiple summer and autumn) and other bacterial foods. common characteristics of poisoning.","professional guidance and preventive measures are similar to those caused by other bacteria. the key is to strengthen health promotion and improve people's health quality. 1 strengthen the sanitation treatment of seafood, and clean, salt, refrigerate and transport seafood products in strict accordance with the hygiene regulations. 2 prevent cross-contamination of raw and cooked foods, do not eat seafood, separate lettuce and cooked vegetables, prevent cross-infection, stir-fry seafood, and store the food before re-cooking. , raw crab, salty grilled shrimp, etc., if eaten raw, must be vinegar for 5min, kill the pathogen.","(1) causes of the disease vibrio parahaemolyticus vibrio spp., gram-negative capsular bacillus, polymorphic cocci and slightly curved vibrio, varying in size, generally 0.7-1.0 米m in length, one end of the cell single flagella, active and halophilic growth, the most suitable medium is 2% to 4% salt, the most suitable temperature is 37 ～ c, ph 7.4 ~ 8.5, 1-3 minutes in vinegar, death, the cells were inactivated by heating at 56 ～ c for 5 to 10 minutes, and died in 1% hydrochloric acid for 5 minutes. the colony morphology often differed depending on the culture conditions, and was mostly oval on ss medium or blood agar medium on the salt protein agar. it is a cocci, the causative factor is the heat-resistant hemolysin (tdh) and the heat-labile hemolysin (trh) produced by the bacterium. the molecular weight of tdh is 42G103, and can not be inactivated at 100 ～ c for 10 min, human, monkey, dogs, rats' red blood cells are sensitive to tdh. vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated from diarrhea patients has a ""kanagawa phenomenon"" positive on wagatsuma agar, so it is thought that the disease may be related to heat-resistant hemolysin, in addition to experimental mice. the heart is toxic, and intravenous injection of small doses of tdh for a few seconds can kill mice. the molecular weight of trh is 48G103, which is composed of two subunits with a molecular weight of 24G103. trh has 68.6% homology with tdh, but trh is not heat-resistant, and is inactivated at 60 ～ c for 10 min. it can cause intestinal mucosal congestion, edema, mild erosion, and can cause secretory intestinal fluid retention and diarrhea through camp and cgmp pathways. vibrio parahaemolyticus is sensitive to acid. when ph is below 6, it can not grow. it dies within 1 to 3 minutes, and rapidly propagates in 3% to 6% sodium chloride solution. it is a cycle every 8 to 9 minutes. the halophilic mechanism of this bacteria is related to the k-h reverse transport system and is resistant to high temperature. small, 5 to 10 minutes at 65 ～c can die; in tap water at room temperature, die within 1 day; river water, pond water, well water no more than 2 days of death;however, it can survive after 47 days in seawater. in -20 ～c peptone water, after 11 weeks, it can still survive. this strain is very resistant to common disinfectants and can be killed by low concentration of phenol and coal phenol soap solution. , vibrio parahaemolyticus has flagella (h), capsular polysaccharide (k) and bacterial (o) anti-caries, flagella (h) anti-caries are common to all strains, do not help the typing, so o and k anti-caries for the basis of serotype typing, there are 12 kinds of o-resistant cockroaches and at least 59 kinds of k-resistant cockroaches. according to their different bacterial cells and flagellar sputum, they can be divided into 25 serotypes. b, e, h are caused. the main serotype of food poisoning, according to phage typing, at least nine types have been obtained in china. (2) pathogenesis the pathogenicity of vibrio parahaemolyticus has been clear to humans, but the pathogenesis of this disease has not yet been fully clarified. some data indicate that the intake of a certain number of live bacteria (105-107) can cause illness. bacteria can invade intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, and pathological damage in the intestine is found in autopsy, indicating that the direct invasion of bacteria has an important role. it is confirmed that tdh and trh have hemolytic activity in addition to enterotoxin, which can cause intestinalz swelling, congestion and retention of intestinal fluid, causing diarrhea, the diarrhea mechanism of vibrio parahaemolyticus is considered to be closely related to the antibacterial toxin component of vibrio cholerae, similar to vibrio cholerae thermotoxin (ct), can pass camp it is caused by cgmp and causes secretory diarrhea. in addition, the heat-resistant hemolysin has a specific cardiotoxic effect, which can cause lesions in rat and guinea pig cardiomyocytes, which can cause atrial fibrillation, premature contraction, and pathological changes of acute enteritis. the duodenum, jejunum and ileum are more obvious, showing diffuse congestion of the intestinal mucosa, edema, deep into the muscular layer and serosal layer, mild erosion, but no ulceration, histological neutralityinfiltration of granulocytes, visceral (stomach, liver, spleen, lung) congestion, recently found that urease is associated with diarrhea of this disease, patients with different physique, immunity, clinical manifestations of different severity, multi-type, mountain, inland residents go in the coastal areas, the infected people are more seriously ill, and the clinical manifestations are typical; the sickness in the coastal areas is generally mild.","['toxic performance', 'abdominal discomfort', 'palate pharyngeal respiratory muscles are...', 'diarrhea', 'mucus stool', 'abdominal pain', 'disgusting']",['shock'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

to liver recovery. drugs that are harmful to the liver, such as isoniazid and barbiturates, should be used with caution or avoidance. 4. quit smoking and alcohol can help fire and blood, long-term drinking, especially hard alcohol, can lead to alcoholic cirrhosis. therefore, drinking alcohol can make patients with cirrhosis worse, and easily cause bleeding. long-term smoking is not conducive to the stability and recovery of liver disease, can accelerate the process of cirrhosis, and has the risk of promoting liver cancer. 5. dietary care is suitable for low-fat, high-protein, high-vitamin and easy-to-digest diets. timely, quantitative, and temperate. in the early stage, you can eat more soy products, fruits, fresh vegetables, and eat sugar, eggs, fish, and lean meat. when liver function is significantly reduced and there is a sign of hepatic coma, you should properly control protein intake and promote low-salt diet or avoid salt diet. the daily intake of salt should not exceed 1 to 1.5 grams, and the water consumption should be within 2000 ml. in severe ascites, the salt intake should be controlled within 500 mg and the water intake should be less than 1000 ml. should avoid spicy and stimulating products and hard and cold food, it is not advisable to eat overheated food to prevent and emit blood. 6. active prevention of cirrhosis is a consequence of the progressive development of the liver due to different causes. it is necessary to pay attention to the prevention and treatment of various primary diseases, actively prevent and treat chronic hepatitis, schistosomiasis, gastrointestinal infections, avoid contact with and use substances that are toxic to the liver, and reduce the pathogenic factors.","pathogenic factors as antigens, such as hepatitis b virus (hbv), hepatitis c virus (hcv), soluble antigen (sea) substances secreted by schistosoma japonicum eggs, mainly cause liver damage through immune response.directly acts on hepatocytes to cause liver damage, such as carbon tetrachloride.the combination of certain drugs and poisons, hepatocyte damage and inflammatory reaction are the response of liver tissue to pathogenic factors, but the inflammatory reaction, hepatocyte regeneration and repair are anti-injury reactions, usually according to necrosis L inflammation L fiber the pattern of hyperplasia is now thought to play a central role in the initiation of liver fibrosis in the process of liver inflammation (chronic liver injury). in recent years, immune effector cells and related cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells have been produced, and hormone-like proteins that transmit interactions between different cells and tissues are collectively referred to as cytokines (including lymphokines and mononuclear factors) or peptides. regulatory factors, in addition to a variety of biological activities, various cytokines also have inducing, receptor regulation and biological effects interactions, thus forming a network of complex cytokines, known by research cytokines are involved in the regulation of liver fibrosis formation, and once the cytokine network is dysregulated, it plays an important role in the formation of liver fibrosis.","['hepatic lesions diffuse', 'abdominal pain with jaundice', 'abdominal mass', 'upper abdominal mass and bloating', 'hepatic stellate cell

hepatopulmonary syndrome,"hepatic-pulmonary syndrome (hps) is a serious complication of end-stage liver disease.it is currently believed that hepatopulmonary syndrome includes three aspects: 1 basic liver disease; 2 pulmonary vasodilation; 3 severe hypoxemia caused by arterial oxygenation dysfunction.clinically, hypoxemia such as dyspnea and cyanosis is prominent.hps is more common in patients with cirrhosis, such as cirrhosis after hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, biliary cirrhosis and other causes of cirrhosis.occasionally in other acute and chronic liver diseases, such as chronic active hepatitis, acute severe hepatitis, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, tyrosinemia, 汐1-antitrypsin deficiency and wilson's disease.","treatment of primary cirrhosis improves liver damage or delays the progression of cirrhosis, thereby reducing hypoxemia, reducing portal pressure, and theoretically reducing right-to-left shunt in the lungs, commonly used beta-blockers, antihistamines, calcium antagonists, etc.avoid violent and sudden rapid standing, bedridden patients often change position and improve local gas exchange in the lungs.","hepatopulmonary syndrome is more common in patients with cirrhosis, such as cirrhosis after liver cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, biliary cirrhosis and other causes of cirrhosis.occasionally occur in other acute and chronic liver diseases, such as chronic active hepatitis, acute severe hepatitis, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, tyrosinemia, 汐1-antitrypsin deficiency and wilson disease. pathophysiology the essence of hepatopulmonary syndrome is hypoxemia caused by pulmonary vasodilation and abnormal arterial oxygenation in liver disease. arterial hypoxemia is due to red blood cells in the blood flowing through the lungs. obtaining sufficient oxygenation or partial blood is not caused by oxygenation through the alveoli at all. since hps has ruled out primary cardiopulmonary disease, the abnormal pathways through which red blood cells may pass are: through the pleural and hilar bronchial vessels. the alveoli are not reached; in the mediastinum, blood flow directly into the pulmonary veins due to the higher pressure of the portal system, thereby bypassing the lung circulation; through the dilated alveolar capillaries or pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas directly into the pulmonary veins, alveolar telangiectasia to hypoxia the formation of blood may be more important. the existing research data show that the occurrence of hepatopulmonary syndrome is at least related to systemic hyperdynamic state, portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and pulmonary hypertension, so the reason is also caused by systemic metabolism and hemodynamic disorders, and involved in the formation of systemic metabolism and hemodynamic disorders,there are important pathophysiological significance.","['hypoxemia', 'cyanosis',  'breathing difficulties', 'liver palm', 'ascites', 'spider mole', 'skull finger (toe)', 'qi short']",['ascites'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

jaundice,"jaundice is a clinical manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia, in which blood bilirubin increases and yellow stains the sclera, skin, mucous membranes, and other tissues and body fluids.the bilirubin in normal blood is only 17米mol/l (1.0mg/dl). if the bilirubin exceeds the normal value and the jaundice is still invisible to the naked eye, it may be called recessive or subclinical jaundice.astragalus is not an independent disease, but a symptom and sign of many diseases, especially in liver, biliary and pancreatic diseases. astragalus is an important pathological change of liver dysfunction, but not all jaundice is caused by liver dysfunction, as well as pre-hepatic erythrocytosis, such as hemolytic jaundice, and post-hepatic such as extrahepatic obstructive jaundice caused by obstruction of the bile duct.",basic chronic diseases such as hepatitis b can be prevented by regular review and timely treatment; cholelithiasis should be prevented by appropriate diet structure; tumor compression can only be discovered through regular physical examination.,"hemolytic jaundice (20%): any disease that causes hemolysis due to massive destruction of red blood cells can cause hemolytic jaundice. the common diseases are as follows. (1) congenital hemolytic anemia: such as thalassemia (hemoglobinopathy), hereditary spherocytosis. (2) acquired acquired hemolytic anemia: such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hereditary glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (folly bean disease), hemolysis after heterotypic transfusion, neonatal hemolysis, falciparum malaria, primaquine lin and other drugs, snake venom, poisonous cockroach poisoning, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. various liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, toxic hepatitis, drug-induced liver disease, various types of cirrhosis, primary and secondary liver cancer, sepsis and leptospirosis, can cause jaundice due to diffuse damage of liver cells. . according to the site of obstruction, it can be divided into two types: extrahepatic bile duct and intrahepatic bile duct obstruction. (1) common diseases causing obstruction of extrahepatic bile duct, including common bile duct stones, stenosis, inflammatory edema, aphids, tumors and congenital biliary atresia; common diseases or causes of bile duct obstruction leading to obstruction of the common bile duct, pancreatic head cancer, chronic pancreatitis with enlarged pancreatic head, ampullary carcinoma, common bile duct cancer, liver cancer, and lymph nodes (cancer metastasis) around the hilar or common bile duct. (2) intrahepatic bile duct obstruction can be divided into intrahepatic obstructive cholestasis and intrahepatic cholestasis. the former is common in intrahepatic bile duct-like stones, cancerous thrombosis (mostly liver cancer), clonorchiasis, etc.; common in capillary bile duct viral hepatitis, drug-induced cholestasis (such as chlorpromazine, methyltestosterone, oral contraceptives, etc.), bacterial sepsis, recurrent jaundice during pregnancy, primary biliary cirrhosis and a few heart or abdominal surgery and so on. it refers to the congenital defects of bilirubin metabolism. the incidence is more common in infants, young children and young people. it often has a family history. if you can survive without death in infants and young children, the jaundice can recur, often in a cold or exercise. infection, induced after fatigue, but the general health of the patients is good, such jaundice is less common in clinical, sometimes misdiagnosed as hepatobiliary diseases, the common diseases of this type of jaundice are the following. (1) gilbert syndrome: the mechanism of jaundice is the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by hepatocytes (light, the most common type of familial jaundice in the clinic) and the lack of glucuronyltransferase in hepatocyte microsomes (heavy due to poor prognosis, the disease is characterized by other normal liver function tests, increased serum unconjugated bilirubin concentration, and increased erythrocyte fragility; after oral administration of gallbladder contrast agent, gallbladder development is good, liver biopsy is not abnormal. (2) dabin-johnson syndrome: the cause of jaundice is that the unconjugated bilirubin is converted into conjugated bilirubin in hepatocytes, and the bilirubin transport and biliary excretion function are impaired. serum binding to bilirubin increased; gallbladder was not developed after oral gallbladder contrast agent; liver appearance was greenish black (observed under laparoscopy), liver biopsy showed diffuse brown pigment particles in liver cells, and the prognosis of this disease was good. (3) rotor syndrome: the cause of jaundice is caused by the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by hepatocytes and the partial discharge of bilirubin into the capillary bile duct. the disease is characterized by both serum non-binding and bilirubin binding. increased; indocyanine green (icg) excretion test disorder (reduced); most of the gallbladder angiography is well developed, only a few are not developed; no pigmentation in the liver, liver biopsy is normal, the prognosis of this disease is generally good. (4) crigler-najjar syndrome: the cause of jaundice is the lack of glucuronyltransferase in hepatocyte microsomes, which makes unconjugated bilirubin unable to convert into bilirubin. the syndrome can be divided into heavy or light, the former because the concentration of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood is very high, and has a strong affinity with adipose tissue in brain tissue, it is prone to bilirubin encephalopathy (nuclear jaundice), which is more common in newborns, and its prognosis is very poor, mostly after birth. one year died; the latter is a part of hepatocyte microsomes lacking glucuronyltransferase, so the symptoms are milder and the prognosis is slightly better. pathogenesis normal bilirubin metabolism (1) source and formation of bilirubin: 80% to 85% of bilirubin is derived from hemoglobin of mature red blood cells. the average life span of normal red blood cells is 120 days, and hemoglobin released from aging and damaged red blood cells is mononuclear- the macrophage system (spleen, liver, bone marrow) swallows, destroys and decomposes, becomes heme, iron and globin under the action of cathepsin (iron is reused by the body, globin enters the protein metabolism pool), hemoglobin is red the action of sputum oxygenase is converted to biliverdin, and biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. the hemoglobin produced by normal humans is destroyed by red blood cells by about 60-80g/l, and the bilirubin is produced. the total amount is about 340-510 米mol/l, with an average of 425 米mol/l; in addition, 15% to 20% of bilirubin is derived from hemoglobin (ineffective hematopoiesis) of immature red blood cells in the bone marrow, and hemoglobin free in the liver. heme-containing proteins (including myoglobin, catalase, peroxidase, cytochrome p450, etc.), which produce bilirubin called bypass bilirubin; bile decomposed from hemoglobin red pigment (also including bypass)bilirubin) is called unconjugated bilirubin; unconjugated bilirubin rapidly binds to serum albumin to form unconjugated bilirubin albumin complex, which is transported to the liver via blood circulation. the erythromycin is insoluble in water and cannot be filtered out from the glomerulus. therefore, the urine does not contain unconjugated bilirubin, but the unconjugated bilirubin is fat-soluble and has a good affinity with adipose tissue. (2) liver's intake, binding and excretion functions for unconjugated bilirubin: 1 the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by the liver: the liver is an important site for bilirubin metabolism. when the unconjugated bilirubin albumin complex is transported to the liver cells by blood, according to the ultrastructural observation, unconjugated bilirubin and after albumin separation, the hepatic sinusoidal disse's gap is taken up by the microprojections of hepatocytes, and after entering the hepatocytes, the unbound bilirubin is carried by the special proteins y and z in the hepatocyte cytoplasm (y and z proteins are used as the carrier is transported to the microsomes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. 2 unbound bilirubin binding (ie, binding to bilirubin formation): glucuronyltransferase in the microsomes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, unbound bilirubin combined with glucuronic acid under the action of the enzyme formation of glucuronic acid ester, or conjugated bilirubin, combined with one molecule of glucuronic acid, bound bilirubin called bilirubin i (monoester), combined with two molecules of glucuronic acid combined with bilirubin called bilirubin ii (diester), most of the bound bilirubin excreted from bile is diester bilirubin, which is water-soluble due to bilirubin binding and can be filtered by glomerulus. excreted from the urine, the urine bilirubin qualitative test was positive. 3 combined with the excretion of bilirubin: how to remove from the liver cells after the formation of bilirubin, the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated, it is considered to be completed by the energy-consuming process of active excretion, combined with bilirubin transported to the capillary by the golgi apparatus biliary microtubules, microbiliary duct, thin bile duct, small bile duct, common hepatic duct, common bile duct, discharged into the duodenum through the duodenal papilla. 4 intestinal circulatory circulation of bilirubin: combined with bilirubin discharged into the intestine after the biliary tract can not be absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, and at the end of the ileum and the colon is reduced to urobilinogen by anaerobic reductase (daily intestine) the total amount of urobilinogen formed by the tract is about 68-473 米mol). most of the urinary biliary oxidization is excreted from the feces by urinary bilirubin, also known as feline (or sacral biliary); 10% to 20%) is absorbed by the ileum and colonic mucosa, and returns to the liver through the portal vein bloodstream. most of the urobilinogens that return to the liver are converted to bilirubin by the action of hepatocytes. it is also discharged into the intestine with bile. this process is called ""intestinal hepatic circulation of bilirubin"". a small part fails to transform into bilirubin, but is a systemic circulation (ie, a small part of urinary biliary L hepatic vein L inferior vena cava L heart L systemic circulation), excreted by the kidneys, the urine urinary tract excreted by urine in normal people every day generally does not exceed 6.8 米mol, and the urine urinary biliary original test is weakly positive or positive. 2. hemolytic jaundice after massive destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), the formation of unbound bilirubin increases, and a large amount of unconjugated bilirubin is transported to the liver, which inevitably increases the burden on the liver (hepatocytes), and exceeds the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by the liver. when combined, it causes an increase in the concentration of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. in addition, the anemia caused by a large amount of hemolysis makes the hepatocytes in the state of hypoxia and ischemia, and their ability to bind unconjugated bilirubin is inevitable. it will be further reduced, resulting in a higher concentration of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood and jaundice. 3. hepatocyte jaundice due to extensive damage (denaturation, necrosis) of hepatocytes, the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by hepatocytes and the occurrence of binding disorders, the concentration of unconjugated bilirubin in serum is increased, and some unimpaired hepatocytes are still can continue to ingest, combined with unconjugated bilirubin, to convert it into bilirubin, but part of it combined with bilirubin failed to excrete in the capillary bile duct, but through the necrotic hepatocyte gap back into the liver lymph in the blood, or due to hepatocyte degeneration, swelling, inflammatory lesions in the portal area, and formation of capillary bile ducts, bile duct bile plugs, so that the excretion of bound bilirubin is blocked, resulting in the binding of bilirubin through the small bile duct overflow (small bile duct when the pressure is increased and the rupture occurs, the blood flow to the liver and the blood flow eventually leads to an increase in the concentration of bound bilirubin in the serum and jaundice. 4. obstructive jaundice (cholestasis jaundice) whether it is capillary bile duct in the liver, microbiliary duct, small bile duct, or extrahepatic bile duct, total hepatic duct, common bile duct and ampulla of the ampulla, etc., obstruction or cholestasis, obstruction or stagnation of the upper bile duct the internal pressure is constantly increasing, and the bile duct is continuously expanding, which will inevitably lead to the intrahepatic small bile duct or microbiliary tube. the capillary bile duct will rupture, so that the combined bilirubin will overflow from the ruptured bile duct, and will flow into the blood and cause jaundice. in addition, some intrahepatic cholestatic stagnation is not caused by mechanical factors such as bile duct rupture (such as drug-induced cholestasis), but also due to reduced bile secretion (secretory dysfunction), increased permeability of capillary bile ducts, bile concentration, stasis and flow reduced, eventually leading to the formation of bile duct salts and the formation of bile.","['liver palm', 'spider', 'abdominal pain', 'nausea', 'indigestion', 'the palm is yellow']",['build up'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

ascariasis,"ascariasis is the most common parasitic disease caused by parasitic nematodes (ascarislumbricoides) parasitic in the human small intestine or other organs. it is widely spread in the country and has many childhood diseases.the clinical manifestations vary greatly depending on the parasitic or invasive site, and the degree of infection varies greatly. it is called intestinal ascariasis only in the intestinal tract.most intestinal ascariasis has no symptoms, and children often have varying degrees of gastrointestinal symptoms.when the mites enter the bile duct, pancreas, appendix and liver, or when the mites move to the lungs, eyes, brain, thyroid and spinal cord, they can cause the corresponding atopic lesions. in severe cases, cholangitis and pancreatitis can be caused. complications such as appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation and peritonitis.","1. control the source of infection: expelling the mites in the human intestine is an important measure to control the source of infection. it should be actively discovered to treat patients with intestinal ascariasis, and regularly treat and treat susceptible people, especially kindergartens, primary schools and rural residents. if more than half of the infected people are found, they can be treated with general rule. 2 to 3 months after the peak of infection (such as winter or autumn), the body can be taken with deworming drugs, and the worms and feces should be treated in time to avoid polluting the environment. 2, pay attention to personal hygiene: develop good personal hygiene habits, wash hands before and after meals, do not drink raw water, do not eat unclean fruits; diligent nail cutting, no stool, etc., for restaurants and restaurants, etc., should be regular carry out hygienic standardization inspections, and prohibit the production of beverages such as raw water. 3, strengthen the management of manure: do a good job of environmental sanitation, harmless treatment of manure, do not use manure to fertilize, do not graze pigs, use harmless human dung as fertilizer, prevent fecal contamination of the environment is an important measure to cut off the transmission of aphids in the area where water manure is used as fertilizer, the five-story three-storage method can be used to make the majority of the eggs in the feces settle at the bottom of the pool. due to the action of free ammonia in the manure and anaerobic fermentation, the eggs can be killed. at the same time, it will also increase fertilizer efficiency, and use the biogas tank to ferment, which can not only solve the lighting of farmers, cook rice, but also facilitate the harmless treatment of manure. it can remove the dung residue once every six months. at this time, most of the eggs have lost their ability to infect. in areas where manure is used as a fertilizer, mud-filling composting can be used. after three days, the temperature in the manure can rise to 52 ～ c or higher, which can kill the eggs.","dietary factors (60%): often caused by accidental consumption of cold vegetables, melons or other unclean objects with mites.the mites are parasitic in the small intestine, disturbing the spleen and stomach, and sucking the water valley.because the mites have a warmth, aversion to cold, heat, good sputum, good at drilling, so when the spleen and stomach dysfunction, or systemic febrile illness, the mites are easy to smash in the abdomen and cause a variety of illnesses .if the mites are drilled into the biliary tract, the cardia, or the number of mites are large, and tangled in the intestine, a variety of lesions and symptoms appear. lifestyle (20%): bad lifestyle habits can cause tsutsugamushi. other factors (10%): temperature, rainfall and people's production and living habits in nature are epidemiologically important factors.","['umbilical pain"", 'stationary doctor', 'sudden right upper quadrant colic', 'diarrhea', 'appetite loss', 'black stool', 'abdominal pain', 'dizziness', 'stag beetle infection' ]","['biliary tsutsugamushi disease', 'acute cholecystitis', 'peritonitis', 'aphid intestinal obstruction', 'aphid acute pancreatitis', 'biliary bleeding', 'sepsis', 'underfragnum abscess', 'insomnia' , 'epilepsy', 'coma']","['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

colonic diverticulosis,"the colonic diverticulum is a colonic wall that protrudes outward to form a pocket, which can be a single, but more often a series of saclike projections that are outward from the lumen of the intestine.the colonic diverticulum can be divided into two categories: true and acquired. the true diverticulum is the congenital full-thickness of the colon wall, and the diverticulum contains layers of the intestinal wall.the acquired diverticulum is the mucosa that is excreted through the weak points of the muscular layer of the intestinal wall, so it is secondary to the increase in pressure in the intestinal lumen, forcing the mucosa to protrude outward through the weak area of the muscle of the intestinal wall.80% of the colonic diverticulum occurs in the sigmoid colon and descending colon.there is very little morbidity before the age of 40, and since then, the incidence has gradually increased with age.","eat less slag of fruit or crude fiber vegetables and irritating foods to avoid increasing bowel movements and worsening symptoms.during the attack period, you should eat a liquid diet to make the stool soft and slippery, reduce the stagnation, and make it easy to be discharged from the diverticulum. you can take 5ml liquid paraffin or senna leaf tea every night before going to sleep. it is not suitable for colon enema to avoid perforation. .","evans suggested that congenital right colon diverticulosis may be due to abnormal embryonic development of the intestinal wall. waugh believes that the cecal diverticulum is caused by overgrowth of the cecum at 7-10 weeks of embryonic development. normally, the development of this part should be atrophy. patients with colonic diverticulosis have a family history. most of the diverticulosis is caused by acquired diseases. the histological study did not find congenital abnormalities in the muscular wall of the colon wall. the increase in the incidence of diverticulosis with age also provides strong evidence for this. the congenital colonic diverticulum is rare. (1) factors affecting the formation of diverticulum: one is the tension of the colon wall, and the other is the pressure difference between the colon cavity and the abdominal cavity. the intracavity pressure of any part can be measured by laplace's pressure law, laplace's pressure law (p=kt/r, p is the pressure in the colon cavity, t is the tension of the intestinal wall, r is the radius of the colon, and k is a constant.): the pressure in the intestinal lumen is proportional to the tension of the intestinal wall and inversely proportional to the radius of the intestinal wall. recently, it has been proved by a pressure gauge. during continuous segmental movement, the colon, especially the sigmoid colon, can produce high intraluminal pressure. the largest intraluminal pressure in the colon is located in the descending colon and sigmoid colon. this pressure is sufficient to cause the mucosa to protrude into the diverticulum of the colon muscle. (2) structural features of the colon wall: it may also be a factor in the incidence of diverticulum. the collagen fibers in the colonic ring muscle are cross-distributed, which maintains the tension of the colon wall. as the age increases, the collagen fibers in the colon cavity become fine, elastin fiber weakened, the elasticity and tension of the colon wall decreased, therefore, the narrowest, most hypertrophic sigmoid colon is the predilection site of the diverticulum, the muscle of the colonic band is in a contracted state, so it is not easy to have a diverticulum, it has been confirmed that the diverticulum patient the sigmoid smooth muscle bundle is thicker than normal. even if there is no thick muscle bundle, the abnormal smooth muscle bundle is a manifestation of the early diverticulum. the abnormal smooth muscle bundle is not only confined to the sigmoid but also to the colon. other sites, such as the upper rectum, are more pronounced after sigmoid resection. these weaknesses in the colon wall have been manifested in the early stages of the disease. in addition, connective tissue disorders caused by structural protein changes are also in the early stages of diverticulosis. certainly works. (3) colonic movement: divided into two types: rhythmic contraction and propelled contraction. the former mainly mixes the contents of the right colon to the back and forth, and promotes the absorption of water and salt. the latter transports the feces to the distal end, and the group creeps (mass peristalsis can cause feces to be pushed directly from the right colon to the sigmoid colon and the upper rectum. the colon is prone to occur on the weak intestinal wall between the colonic bands (fig. 3). when the segmental motion increases, the intraluminal pressure increases. the weak part of the vein is likely to form a diverticulum where the blood vessels enter the colon wall (figure 4). (1) obesity: obesity was previously thought to be related to diverticulosis, but studies have confirmed that this is not the case. hugh et al found that subcutaneous fat thickness was not associated with diverticulum incidence. (2) cardiovascular disease: there is no correlation between hypertension and diverticulosis, but the incidence of diverticulum in patients with atherosclerosis is increased, which is presumed to be related to the ischemia of the inferior mesenteric artery. the incidence of diverticulosis in male patients who have had previous episodes of myocardial infarction 57%, significantly higher than male patients in the same age group (25%), aged over 65 years, the incidence of diverticulum in patients with cerebrovascular accident was significantly higher than the control group. (3) affective factors and irritable bowel syndrome: no psychological and emotional factors were found to be associated with diverticulosis. this is different from irritable bowel syndrome. there are many similarities between irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulosis (such as stool weight). , the content of fecal bile acid and fecal electrolyte, etc.), the former intestinal base pressure is also increased, and the two often exist simultaneously, emg examination both have fast waves, both food and neostitis excessive stress response, and high-fiber diet can correct the abnormal delivery time, increase stool weight, reduce intestinal pressure, it is generally believed that inhibition of exhaust and defecation will increase intestinal pressure and promote diverticulum formation, but this is not the case, because the young people's sphincter function is very strong, the incidence of diverticulum is not high, and the elderly with rectal sphincter relaxation is more frequent, and in patients with megacolon and constipation, the diverticulum is rare.","['urinary frequency', 'diarrhea', 'pelvic mass', 'river after heavy', 'stool blood', 'mucus stool', 'abdominal pain', 'wasting', 'abscess', 'peritonitis']",['intestinal obstruction'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
methanol poisoning,"methanol, also known as wood alcohol or wood alcohol, is one of the main components of industrial alcohol.volatile, flammable, slightly alcoholic liquid, 5-10 ml of methanol can cause serious poisoning, 15ml can cause blindness, 20ml of ml can be fatal.the damage to the body is mainly: 1. it has obvious anesthetic effect on the central nervous system.2. it has a special selection effect on the optic nerve and retina, causing obvious eye damage.3. systemic diseases characterized by metabolic acidosis.","the production process of manufacturing and application of methanol should be closed, and equipment maintenance should be carried out regularly to prevent running, running, dripping and leaking.when packaging and transporting, personal protection should be strengthened to prevent the container from rupturing or leaking.in addition, it is necessary to strictly maintain the system and prevent misuse of methanol as an alcoholic beverage.obvious neurological diseases, organic psychosis, retinal and optic neuropathy should be classified as occupational contraindications.","methanol is absorbed through the respiratory tract and digestive tract, and the skin can also be partially absorbed. it is distributed in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, bile and urine. the content is extremely high, the lowest in bone marrow and adipose tissue, and the oxidation and excretion of methanol in the body are slow, so there is obvious accumulation. the main toxicity mechanism of methanol is: 1 anesthetic effect on the nervous system. 2 methanol dehydrogenase action, metabolic conversion to formaldehyde, formic acid, inhibition of certain oxidase systems, causing aerobic metabolic disorders, accumulation of lactic acid and other organic acids in the body, causing acidosis. 3 due to methanol and its metabolite formaldehyde, formic acid in the aqueous humor and eye tissue content is high, causing metabolic disorders of the retina, easily lead to retinal cells, optic nerve damage and optic nerve demyelination.","['insomnia', 'debilitating', 'ocular nerve atrophy', 'vision deficit', 'confusion blur', 'delirium', 'ocular nipple pale', 'dizziness', 'low', 'review']",['arrhythmia'],['emergency department'],"['anti-toxic treatment of ethanol, drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

tuberculous peritonitis,"tuberculous peritonitis (tuberculous peritonitis) is a chronic diffuse peritoneal infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis.it is more common in children and young adults.the woman is slightly more than the male, 1.2~2.0:1.the main clinical manifestations are burnout, fever, abdominal pain and abdominal distension. they can be divided into three types: adhesion type, exudative type and cheese type, which can cause complications such as intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation and fistula formation.","1. controlling the source of infection and managing the source of infection is an important link in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. early detection and early treatment should be done. for this reason, collective lung health check should be carried out regularly, and a registration management system should be implemented. 2. cut off the route of transmission and manage the patient's sputum. the main methods are: carry out mass health campaigns, widely publicize phlegm prevention knowledge, develop good hygiene habits, and not spit, tb patients should vomit on paper add and burn, or cough in a cup to add 2% coal phenol soap or 1% formaldehyde solution (about 2h can be sterilized), the contact directly exposed to sunlight (sterilized for several hours). 3. vaccination with bcg to inoculate bcg can enhance the body's resistance to tuberculosis, and is conducive to the prevention of tuberculosis. at present, china is required to vaccinate bcg after birth, and the negative ones add seeds. for ethnic minorities, border residents enter the inland cities, or recruits. when the tuberculin test is necessary, the negative person is vaccinated with bcg.","the majority of tuberculous peritonitis is secondary to tuberculosis in other organs. the path of infection of this disease can be directly spread by intra-abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated by blood. the former is more common, such as intestinal tuberculosis, mesenteric lymphatic tuberculosis, tubal tuberculosis, etc., can be the direct primary lesion of the disease. more women than men may be due to retrograde infection of pelvic tuberculosis. (1) the cause of the disease tuberculosis belongs to the actinomycetes, the mycobacteria of the mycobacteria family, which are pathogenic acid-resistant bacteria, mainly divided into human, cattle, birds, mice, etc., which are pathogenic to humans. mainly human bacteria, bovine bacteria rarely infected, tuberculosis morphology is slender and curved, both ends are obtuse, no spores or capsules, no flagella, length 1 ~ 5米m, width 0.2 ~ 0.5米m, in the specimen in the form of dispersion or piles or arranged in a chain, mycobacterium tuberculosis is an aerobic bacteria, does not multiply in the absence of oxygen, but can still survive for a long time, under good conditions, about 18 ~ 24h breeding generation, bacteria the body lipid component accounts for about 1/4 of its weight. it is acid-resistant when dyed. the tuberculosis is highly resistant to dryness and strong acid and strong alkali. it can exist in the external environment for a long time and can survive in the earthworm. 30h, the wet and dry place survived for 6-8 months, but the resistance to damp heat is very low. it can be killed by boiling for 5 minutes or directly exposed to sunlight for 2 hours. the uv disinfection effect is better. both human and bovine tuberculosis strains are obligate parasites, with humans and cattle as natural storage hosts, both of which are equivalent to humans, monkeys and guinea pigs. the virulence of the disease, the resistance of the tuberculosis to the drug, can be formed by the development of the innate drug-resistant bacteria in the flora, or it can be quickly produced due to the use of an anti-tuberculosis drug alone in the human body. sexuality, that is, the acquisition of drug-resistant bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria can cause treatment difficulties, affect the efficacy, long-term exposure to streptomycin can also produce dependence, the so-called lai drug, but lai medicine is rare in the clinic. there are two sources of peritoneal lesions: 1. abdominal lesions such as intestinal tuberculosis, mesenteric lymphatic tuberculosis or active lesions of pelvic tuberculosis directly spread to the peritoneum. 2. blood-stained miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis can be disseminated to the peritoneum by blood; the blood-borne dissemination caused by the primary pulmonary syndrome can form a potential lesion in the peritoneum, and tuberculous peritonitis can occur when the body's resistance is low. (b) the pathogenesis according to the main pathological changes of the peritoneum into oozing type, adhesion type and cheese type. 1. exudative abdominal cavity is mostly serous fibrinous exudate, grass yellow, occasionally slightly bloody, thickened visceral layer and wall peritoneum, congestion, edema, attached fibrinous exudate, yellow or grayish white small tuberculous nodules of varying sizes of miliary granules also merge into larger plaques. 2. adhesive peritoneum is obviously thickened, there is a small amount of serous fibrinous exudate, a large amount of fibrin deposition and fibrous tissue hyperplasia cause extensive adhesion between mesentery, mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal tube, forming masses, resulting in compression of intestinal tract caused by chronic intestine obstruction, thick omentum thickening, hardening into clumps, severe abdominal cavity completely occlusion. 3. the cheese type is mainly peritoneal cheese-like necrotic lesions. the intestine, the omentum, the mesenteric or the abdominal viscera are separated from each other into a small chamber, and a small amount of turbid purulent exudate accumulates. the vaginal or abdominal wall is worn out to form internal hemorrhoids or feces, which is more common in patients with advanced stage. at the same time, mesenteric lymph nodes with necrosis of cheese can form tuberculous abscesses. according to statistical analysis, the most common type of adhesion is followed by the type of exudation, and the type of cheese is the least. in the process of disease development, there are often two types or three types coexisting, called ""hybrid type"".","[' dull pain', 'stationary doctor', 'intestinal adhesion', 'intestinal', 'abdominal' flexibility' sign ', 'diarrhea', 'ascites', 'acute abdominal pain', 'peritonitis']",['intestinal fistula'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

acute suppurative cholangitis,"acute suppurative cholangitis, also known as acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis, refers to acute bacterial biliary infection caused by obstruction of the bile duct. it is the most important and direct cause of death in patients undergoing biliary surgery. most of them are secondary to bile duct stones and biliary tract. tumor.abdominal pain, chills fever, and jaundice are typical symptoms, often referred to as the charcot triad.the pain is usually in the lower part of the xiphoid and/or the right upper abdomen. it is exacerbated by persistent pain and can be radiated to the right shoulder and back. if there is chills, it indicates bacteremia.in the charcot triad plus hypotension and central nervous system depression, the reynolds five-link, is a manifestation of severe acute cholangitis with a very high mortality rate.","acute suppurative cholangitis is a serious complication of hepatolithiasis and biliary ascariasis. therefore, the primary prevention of this disease is mainly for the prevention and treatment of hepatolithiasis and biliary mites. 1. prevention and treatment of hepatolithiasis, the key to prevention of hepatolithiasis is to prevent and eliminate pathogenic factors.patients who have been diagnosed with hepatolithiasis should be highly alert to the occurrence of this disease, especially in the case of concurrent biliary infections.early use of high-dose sensitive antibiotics to fight infection, pay attention to water, electrolytes and acid-base balance, strengthen systemic support for the treatment of biliary tract infections.as soon as the general condition allows, surgery should be performed as soon as possible to remove stones and smooth drainage, so as to prevent the occurrence of aost. 2, prevention and treatment of biliary ascariasis.when the mites enter the biliary tract, they cause different degrees of obstruction of the biliary tract, which increases the pressure of the biliary tract. when a bacterial infection occurs, aost can be induced.in addition, biliary ascariasis is also an important factor in the formation of hepatolithiasis.therefore, prevention and treatment of biliary ascariasis is an extremely important aspect of preventing aost.mainly pay attention to drinking water, food hygiene, prevention and treatment of intestinal ascariasis.once the diagnosis is diagnosed, if it is diagnosed as biliary ascariasis, it should be treated as soon as possible.give analgesia, relieve phlegm, control infection, and prompt the mites to withdraw from the biliary tract.in addition, duodenal endoscopy can be performed, and a part of the mites entering the common bile duct can be pulled out of the body by a snare.surgical treatment is considered when treatment is ineffective.","most of them are secondary to bile duct stones and biliary ascariasis, but lesions such as bile duct stricture and biliary tumors can sometimes be secondary to these diseases. these diseases cause bile duct obstruction, cholestasis, and secondary bacterial infections. the pathogens are almost all from the intestines. the biliary tract can be retrogradely entered through the ampulla or biliary anastomosis. bacteria can also enter the biliary tract through blood or lymphatic channels. the pathogens are mainly escherichia coli, klebsiella, streptococcus faecalis and some anaerobic bacteria. bacteria.","['shock', 'blood pressure drop', 'bile excretion blocked', 'irritability', ' gallbladder dyskinesia', 'nausea', 'biliary rupture', 'abdominal pain, fever and jaundice']",['peritonitis'],"['surgery', 'hepatobiliary surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
acute hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis,"acute hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis (acute hemorrhagicnecrotizingenteritis) is an acute cellulitis of the intestine characterized by extensive hemorrhage and necrosis of the small intestine. the lesion mainly affects the jejunum and ileum, and can also invade the duodenum and colon.the main clinical manifestations are abdominal pain, blood in the stool, fever, vomiting and bloating. in severe cases, there may be complications such as shock, intestinal paralysis and other symptoms such as intestinal perforation, which are clinically common acute fulminant diseases.","in the high-yielding summer and autumn seasons, attention should be paid to food hygiene and good rest. children of school age should be dewormed according to the national immunization requirements, and work and rest should be combined.pay attention to the following aspects of diet: 1. avoid eating uncooked or spoiled meat, especially in the high season to avoid eating raw meat. 2. avoid eating a lot of foods that damage proteolytic enzymes in the intestines, such as sweet potato foods, especially when eating raw seafood, barbecues that may not be fully cooked (such as kebabs, etc.), avoid eating large amounts of such foods at the same time. . 3. balance the diet and avoid overeating.","the visceral vasoconstriction caused by various reasons, the insufficiency of mesenteric vascular blood supply can cause intestinal ischemic damage, and the intestinal mucosa is most susceptible to ischemia. experimental observation of the rat's small intestinal mucosa after hemorrhagic shock for 1 h autolysis occurs. the principle of clinical treatment of ischemic damage should be to restore blood reperfusion as soon as possible to increase tissue oxygen supply, but long-term ischemia will occur after reperfusion injury reperfusion injury (reinfusion injury), this damage is due to calcium overloading, oxygen free radical generation, neutrophil activation caused by the release of various enzymes including elastase and collagenase and endothelial cell homeostasis. the intestine is the largest bacterial reservoir in the human body. due to the protective effect of the intestinal mucosa itself, bacteria and toxins cannot be invaded. this protective effect is called the defense barrier. shock, intestinal ischemia, asphyxia, artificial feeding, etc. can cause the intestines. the destruction of the barrier, which in turn causes the imbalance of bacterial micro-ecology in the intestine and the invasion of bacteria and toxins induces ahne. there is no definitive understanding of ahne pathogenic pathogens, but anaerobic bacteria, escherichia coli, specific klebsiella, fusiform spores or genus aeromonas can be isolated from the patient's feces. even viruses, etc., can cause intestinal wall infection, necrosis, perforation, c-type clostridium perfringens (the beta-toxin-producing welchii bacilli) in the stool is easy to cause pathogenic effects, causing intestinal microcirculation disturbance, and showing patchy gangrenous intestinal lesions. the intestinal barrier function includes mechanical, immune, biological, chemical and motor function barriers. under normal conditions, intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, intercellular connections and bacterial membranes form a mechanical barrier, and intestinal mucus and mucin form a covering of the intestinal mucosa. the surface of the elastin layer prevents bacteria from invading and protects against chemical and mechanical stimuli. normally, secretory immunoglobulin (siga) secreted by the intestinal mucosa is extremely important for mucosal local immune function and is an immune barrier. its role is to form a protective layer on the surface of the mucous membrane, prevent bacterial adhesion, agglomerate bacteria, inhibit bacterial activity and neutralize bacterial toxins and protect against viruses. for a variety of proteolytic enzymes, siga deficiency, bacteria adhere to the mucosal epithelium and form colonies in turn, bacteria and endotoxins invade the systemic circulation through the portal vein and lymphatic system, forming intestinal endotoxemia and bacterial translocation (bt). in recent years, the pathogenesis of ahne has been concentrated on the study of inflammatory mediators. injury, intestinal endotoxemia and bacterial translocation can trigger a chain reaction between cytokines and inflammatory mediators under certain conditions. platelet activating factor (paf), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf汐), interleukin-6 (il-6) and endothelin-1 (et-1) may be found in animal models of ahne. sexual medium. although the foregoing exemplifies a number of reasons for the occurrence of the disease, it is true that some cases do not have these susceptibility factors. materials have confirmed that the occurrence of ahne is associated with viral infection and cocaine addiction in pregnant women. because cocaine has an 汐-adrenergic effect, it can reduce the blood flow of the uterus and increase the contraction of the mesenteric blood vessels of the fetus, thereby causing a series of changes in the fetal hypoxia. most of the lesions invade the lower part of the jejunum or the upper part of the ileum. in only a few cases, all small intestines and colons are involved at the same time. the diseased bowel is generally characterized by congestion, edema, thickening of the intestinal wall, loss of elasticity and peristalsis, and focal necrosis. severe subserosal bleeding point and flaky necrosis, intestinal tube dilatation, intestinal cavity filled with turbid bloody fluid and necrotic substance, affected intestinal segment can also be all small intestine and invade the colon, perforation and peritonitis can occur, the mesentery of the diseased intestinal segment can also be affected, mesangial lymph node enlargement, the lesion begins from the submucosal layer and gradually extends to the muscular layer after going up to the mucosa. generally, the range of mucosal lesions is larger than that displayed on the surface of the serosa. the layers of the intestinal wall seen under the microscope are hyperemic and edematous. a large number of lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes, eosinophilic and neutrophil infiltration, vascular wall collagen fiber swelling and fibrosis, intermuscular ganglion cell degeneration, small blood vessel necrosis and thrombosis, intestinal wall focal hemorrhage, necrosis and ulcers. causes of the disease so far, there is no satisfactory explanation for the pathogenesis of ahne, but the opinions are quite consistent in some susceptibility factors and reasoning. these susceptibility factors include: intestinal ischemia, intestinal infection, intestine impaired barrier function, respiratory distress syndrome, hemorrhage, asphyxia, congenital heart disease with heart failure, sepsis, shock, hypothermia, erythrocytosis and/or high blood viscosity, artificial feeding, etc. associated with the infection with the toxin-producing welchii bacillus (c-type clostridium perfringens), b-toxin can cause intestinal tissue necrosis and produce gangrenous enteritis. in the papua new guinea plateau where the incidence of this disease is high, the study found that the local residents have low levels of protease in the intestine, which is associated with a low-protein diet and the heat-resistant trypsin inhibitor (heatstable) contained in the local sweet potato. trypsin inhibitors), in animal experiments, perfused with welchii bacilli through the gastric tube, the animal is not pathogenic; but if the raw sweet potato powder or raw soy flour containing trypsin inhibitor is simultaneously infused, it can cause disease and produce acute the same histopathological changes of hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis, animal experiments have also proved that the dog pancreas extract containing trypsin can prevent and reduce the occurrence and development of this disease, the above facts suggest that the disease occurs in addition to eating contaminated meat with pathogenic bacteria in addition to food-like foods, there are other dietary factors, such as sudden changes in eating habits, from eating more vegetables to eating more meat, so that the ecology of the intestines changes, which is conducive to the reproduction of welchii bacilli; the presence of a large amount of enteric trypsin inhibitor reduces the destruction of b toxin. the main pathological changes of this disease are fibrin deposition in the small arteries of the intestinal wall, embolization and small intestinal bleeding and necrosis. the lesions are more common and severe in the jejunum and ileum; sometimes the duodenum, colon and stomach are involved; cases of the gastrointestinal tract can be affected, the lesions are often segmental, can be limited to a segment of the intestine, can also be multiple, lesions often start in the mucosa, manifested as swelling, extensive bleeding, wrinkled top is covered with green pseudomembrane, but the lesion and the normal mucosa are clearly defined. the lesion can extend to the mucosal muscle layer, even involving the serosa. the intestinal wall of the lesion is obviously thickened and hardened. in severe cases, it can cause intestinal ulcer and intestinal perforation. different shades of necrosis change, the light is only the top of the villi, the severe one can involve the whole layer of the mucosa, in addition to extensive bleeding in the submucosa, there may be severe edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, the muscle layer and the serosa layer may be slightly hemorrhage, intestinal smooth muscle can be seen swelling, rupture, glassy and necrosis, the blood vessel wall is fibrin-like necrosis, and often thrombosis, intestinal muscle plexus cells can have dystrophic changes. in addition to intestinal lesions, there may be local mesenteric lymphadenopathy, softening; liver steatosis, acute splenitis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema; individual cases may be accompanied by adrenal focal necrosis. the onset of acute calculous cholecystitis is due to stones blocking the cystic duct, causing bile retention in the gallbladder, secondary bacterial infection causing acute inflammation, such as inflammation, congestion and edema only in the gallbladder mucosa, known as acute simple cholecystitis if the inflammation spreads to the whole layer of the gallbladder, the gallbladder is filled with pus, and the serosal surface also has purulent fibrinous exudation, it is called acute suppurative cholecystitis. the gallbladder is extremely swollen due to empyema, causing ischemia and gangrene of the gallbladder wall. is acute gangrenous cholecystitis, necrosis of the gallbladder wall can be perforated, leading to biliary peritonitis, gallbladder perforation occurs in the gallbladder at the bottom of the gallbladder or stone incarcerated gallbladder ampulla or neck, such as gallbladder perforation to adjacent organs such as duodenum, colon and stomach, etc., can cause biliary fistula, at this time the acute inflammation in the gallbladder can be drained through the internal fistula, the inflammation can quickly disappear, the symptoms are relieved, such as the discharge of pus in the gallbladder common bile duct can cause acute cholangitis, a small number of people can also develop acute pancreatitis, most of the pathogenic bacteria are escherichia coli, klebsiella and streptococcus faecalis, anaerobic bacteria account for 10 to 15%, butwhen up to 45%. acute acalculous cholecystitis, cystic duct often without obstruction, the cause of most patients is unclear, often occurs in trauma, or some abdominal surgery unrelated to the biliary system, sometimes can occur in some non-hemolytic anemia children, generally it is believed that the effects of dehydration after surgery and trauma, fasting, application of anesthetic analgesics, and neuroendocrine factors caused by severe stress response lead to decreased gallbladder contractility, bile retention and decreased gallbladder mucosal resistance. on the basis of secondary bacterial infection, and finally caused acute inflammation of the gallbladder, it is also believed that some cases are caused by acute embolism of the gallbladder's nutritional vascular disease. the pathological evolution of such acute acalculous cholecystitis is similar to that of calculous cholecystitis, but the course of disease development rapidly, it usually develops into gangrenous cholecystitis within 24 hours and manifests itself as gangrene of the entire gallbladder.","['abdominal pain with blood in the stool', 'wound', 'yantie', 'diarrhea', 'liqian houzhong', 'peritoneal irritation', 'gel-like stool', 'abdominal

colonic atresia,"the incidence of colon atresia is 1 in 1500 to 20,000, and less than 5% occur in colons in all cases of intestinal atresia.the etiology and pathology are basically the same as the small intestine atresia.types are: 1 diaphragm composed of mucosa and submucosa, more common in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon. 2 both ends are blind ends with connective tissue in the middle. 3 there is no connective tissue between the two blind ends, which is more common in the transverse colon.","maintain local cleanliness after surgery to prevent anal stenosis caused by various infections.the main preventive measures: 1, early pregnancy, avoid fever and cold.women who have had high fever in early pregnancy, even if the child does not have obvious appearance deformity, brain tissue development may be adversely affected, manifested as mental retardation, poor learning and reaction ability, this mental retardation can not be restored.of course, fetal fever caused by high fever is also related to the sensitivity of pregnant women to high fever and other factors. 2. avoid getting close to dogs and cats.few people know that cats with bacteria are also a source of infectious diseases that are a great threat to fetal malformation, and cat feces are the main route of transmission of this malignant infectious disease. 3. avoid women who wear makeup every day.according to the survey, the incidence of fetal malformations in heavy makeup is 1.25 times less than that of heavy makeup.the main adverse effects on fetal malformation are arsenic, lead, mercury and other toxic substances contained in cosmetics, which affect the normal development of the fetus.secondly, some of the ingredients in the cosmetics are exposed to ultraviolet rays in the sun to produce teratogenic aromatic amine compounds. 4, to avoid mental stress during pregnancy.human emotions are controlled by the central nervous system and the endocrine system. one of the endocrine corticosteroids is closely related to human mood changes.when pregnant women are emotionally stressed, adrenocortical hormone may block the fusion of a certain tissue of the embryo. if it occurs during the first 3 months of pregnancy, it will cause malformations such as cleft lip or palate. 5. avoid drinking alcohol.pregnant women drink alcohol, alcohol can enter the developmental embryo through the placenta, causing serious damage to the fetus.such as a small head, very small ear and nose and a wide upper lip. 6, avoid eating mold and vegetarian food.experts pointed out that if pregnant women eat food contaminated with mycotoxin (mildew food), mycotoxins can cause fetal chromosome breaks in the fetus through the placenta.","congenital malformation of the intestine is one of the common causes of intestinal obstruction in the neonatal period. causes of the disease 1. intestinal cavitation in the embryonic period according to tandie's theory, it is believed that before the fifth week of embryonic development, the digestive lumen has a complete intestinal tube covered by epithelial cells. after that, the epithelial cells grew extremely fast, and the intestinal lumen was occluded due to the proliferation of epithelial cells, which was called the parenchymal phase. later, vacuoles appeared in the middle, forming cystic spaces and merging with each other. at 12 weeks of embryonic re-opening of the intestine, if the gaps were incomplete, the formation of occlusion or stenosis. in recent years, some questions have been raised about this theory. for example, type iii small intestine or colon atresia cannot be explained by tandler's theory. 2. the fetal mesenteric blood circulation is impaired due to damage, mesenteric vascular branch malformation or occlusion, fetal intra-abdominal infection such as fecal peritonitis can lead to colonic atresia and stenosis. louw et al. conducted a study on the etiology of colonic atresia. in 1955, a fetal dog was used for the test. they ligated a small mesenteric blood vessel in the litter, which can cause this small intestine atresia, and this segment of the small mesentery is also defective. it is suggested that the gastrointestinal atresia is caused by obstruction after the embryonic mesenteric injury. the cause of the injury may be the intestine. torsion, poor intestinal rotation, internal hemorrhoids or vascular malformations. abram et al (1968) used 80 days of sheep fetus to test the tear of the mesentery of the sheep, almost 100% can cause type i, ii or iii intestinal atresia, so the colonic atresia and stenosis may occur during embryonic development. any one of them exists. pathogenesis 1. pathology: pathology and small intestine atresia are very similar, according to the degree and shape of the atresia, can be type 3: type i diaphragm atresia: the membranous septum in the intestinal lumen, the membranous septum colonic cavity is divided into the far and near side, the two parts do not communicate with each other; or a small hole in the center of the diaphragm communicates to form a narrow colon. type ii cord-like atresia: the mesentery is intact, the distal end of the intestine, and the blind end of the proximal end are connected by a fiber cord. type iii mesenteric defect: the distal end of the intestine is the blind end of the separation. the mesentery also has a v-shaped defect. intestinal atresia and stenosis occurring in ascending and transverse colons are mostly type iii, and intestinal atresia and stenosis occurring far beyond the splenic curvature are more common in type i and ii. the proximal tubule of the atresia is obviously dilated, hypertrophic, and the peristaltic function is poor. the distal intestine is collapsed, shrunk and thinned, and there is a white hard mucus substance in the intestinal lumen.if the ileocecal valve is intact and the atresia is located far beyond the colonic hepatic curvature, a blind sputum is formed, and the blind sacral intestine between the ileocecal valve and the atresia is highly dilated, and the intestinal wall is thin, ischemic, necrotic, and even perforated.because part of the intestinal atresia and stenosis occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy, about 10% to 20% of children with colonic atresia can expel fetuses soon after birth. 2. combined malformation: colonic atresia is often accompanied by skeletal deformities such as phalanges, multiple fingers and clubfoot, ocular and cardiovascular malformations; abdominal wall, umbilical bulge and other abdominal wall deformities, congenital megacolon, duodenum and small intestine atresia.","['the formation of hard dung in the colon', 'lower abdominal pain', 'intestinal atresia', 'grand jue silver']",['constipation'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment rehabilitation treatment']"

colonic fistula,"colonic fistula is a relatively common and serious surgical complication that can cause a series of pathological changes. 80% of intestinal fistulas occur after surgery and the mortality rate is extremely high.colonic fistula can be divided into extracranial hemorrhoids and colonic hemorrhoids according to the position of the fistula.the distal end of the colon is located in the colon at one end and on the body surface at the other end.in the colon, one end of the fistula is located in the colon, and the other end is located in other hollow organs.colonic fistula is clinically characterized by low flow, few complications, easy to contagion, and poor prognosis.","in the various surgical operations of the intestines, attention should be paid to the treatment of wounds to prevent the formation of gargles. at the same time, attention should also be paid to daily life: 1. establish normal dietary habits. 2. prevention of constipation and diarrhea. 3. develop good bowel habits.","tubular tendon: it can be formed after pathological or postoperative operation, especially the abdominal drainage tube is hard, and the intestinal wall is caused by necrosis of the colon. the tube is small and the tube is long. most of the intestinal contents flow into the intestine at the distal end of the fistula. only a small part of the body flows out of the mouth. lip-shaped sputum: mostly caused by trauma, the intestine is close to the abdominal wall, a part of the intestinal mucosa is turned out of the mouth, and the contents of the intestine are partially discharged from the external fistula and partially into the distal intestine. completely paralyzed: mostly due to surgery, the intestine is fully valgus, exposing the abdominal wall, and most or most of the contents of the intestine flow out of the mouth.","['abdominal tenderness', 'digestive tract perforation', 'abdominal wound effluent fecal sample', 'abdominal pain', 'abdominal tension', 'toxemia', 'abdominal infection']",['malnutrition'],"['surgery', 'anorectal']","['medical conservative treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
colon cancer,"colon cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract, accounting for the second place in the gastrointestinal tumor.the predilection site is the junction of rectum and rectum and sigmoid colon, accounting for 60%. the incidence is more than 40 years old, the ratio of male to female is 2:1. the incidence of colon cancer is mainly related to the high fat and low cellulose diet.chronic inflammation of the colon causes the incidence of bowel cancer to be higher than in the general population.in colonic polyps, the incidence of colon cancer is five times higher than that of colon-free polyps.familial multiple intestinal polyposis, the incidence of cancer is higher.genetic factors may also be involved in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. early symptoms of colon cancer are obvious, and the middle and late stage can be manifested as abdominal distension, indigestion, and then changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, mucus or sticky stool.after tumor ulceration, blood loss, and toxin absorption, symptoms such as anemia, hypothermia, fatigue, weight loss, and lower extremity edema often occur. surgical resection can be performed in the early stage of colon cancer, but the recurrence rate after surgical resection is high. therefore, the combination of traditional chinese and western medicine in colon cancer is the best method. surgical resection of tumor lesions, tcm holistic treatment can remove residual cancer cells and prevent recurrence and metastasis, for patients who are unable to operate in the advanced stage or who are older and weaker, are treated with traditional chinese medicine, control the development of the disease, and gradually improve the treatment, and finally achieve the purpose of tumor survival.","colon cancer is the third leading cause of death in the world. although the treatment of colon cancer has made great progress, the 5-year survival rate of advanced colon cancer has not changed much. therefore, the significance of colon cancer prevention is becoming more and more important. according to the multi-stage theory of the cancer process. the occurrence of colon cancer also undergoes three stages of initiation, promotion, and progression. in morphology, it is characterized by normal mucosa L hyperplasia L adenoma formation L adenoma carcinogenesis L infiltration and metastasis. if the cancer of familial adenomatous polyposis becomes a model, the natural history of colon cancer can be as long as 10 to 35 years. this provides a very favorable opportunity for the prevention of colon cancer. according to different interventions at different stages of the natural history of colon cancer, china has developed the following prevention strategies. 1. primary prevention eliminates or reduces the exposure of the large intestinal mucosa to carcinogens before tumor formation, inhibits or blocks the carcinogenesis of epithelial cells, thereby preventing the occurrence of tumors. these include dietary interventions, chemoprevention, and treatment of precancerous lesions. (1) dietary intervention british scholar burkitt has long pointed out that colon cancer is a ""modern disease"" related to modern lifestyles and diet types. a large number of epidemiological studies, especially immigration epidemiological studies, show that colon cancer has excessive onset and energy intake, obesity, excessive intake of saturated fatty acids, decreased physical activity, dietary fiber and micronutrients (vitamins a, e, c, trace element selenium and calcium) are associated with insufficient intake. dietary fiber is the most studied in terms of dietary intervention. as early as the 1960s and 1970s, burkitt found that colon cancer was very rare among african blacks, and the african aborigines' diet contained a lot of dietary fiber, so he proposed that the high-fiber diet is a hypothesis for colon cancer protection factor. subsequent studies have shown that dietary fiber can dilute or absorb carcinogens in the feces, speeding up the passage of food residues in the intestines, thereby reducing the exposure of intestinal mucosa to carcinogens in food. at the same time, dietary fiber can also protect colon cancer by changing the metabolism of bile acid, lowering the ph of the colon and increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids. early observational epidemiological studies and case-control studies have shown that dietary fiber has a protective effect on colon cancer with increasing intake. for example, howe pooled data from 13 case-control studies with a total of 5,287 patients and 10,470 controls, and found that 12 of these studies supported a negative correlation between dietary fiber intake and colon cancer incidence; the intake of c and beta carotene has only a small negative correlation with the onset of colon cancer. in the prospective clinical intervention trials, such as the occurrence of colon cancer as an ""end-point"", long-term follow-up is required to reach a definitive conclusion, so some people advocate the use of precancerous lesions - adenoma (or recurrence) as an indicator of the risk of colon cancer, in recent years, some ""intermediate markers"" have been advocated to evaluate the effects of interventions, in order to greatly shorten the time required for intervention trials. the most commonly used meta-term index is the rectal mucosal crypt sputum-labeled thymidine (htdr) incorporation index (li), which reflects the proliferation of cells. studies have confirmed that li is associated with colon cancer risk and has been widely used in diets. evaluation of the intervention trial. in recent years, immunohistochemical assays have been established to detect the incorporation of brominated deoxyuridine (br-udr) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna). these assays do not require the use of radionuclides to reflect cell proliferation. other intermediate indicators for evaluation included microscopic examination of abnormal crypts and microadenomas, as well as protein kinase c (pkc) and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) activities. for example, alberts et al. added a 13.5 g/d wheat bran fiber to a group of 17 patients with colon cancer after surgery. the rectal crypt li was used as an indicator, and 6 of the 8 patients with high li were observed to have a significant decrease in li. the total decline rate of the whole group was 22% (p<0 001="""" reddy="""" 10g="""" d="""" decosse="""" 58="""" fap="""" 1="""" 4="""">11g/d wheat bran can reduce the recurrence of adenomas, while vitamin c (4g/d) and vitamin e (400mg/d) do not. however, large-scale prospective trials completed in recent years have failed to confirm the protective effects of dietary fiber. schatzkin et al reported that 2079 patients with a history of colon cancer were randomly divided into two groups, one group was given dietary advice and received a low-fat, high-fiber diet, and the other group was kept on a regular diet and was not consulted. colonoscopy was found 1 to 4 years later. there was no difference in the recurrence rate of colon adenocarcinoma between the two groups. a randomized controlled study by albert et al. in arizona recently showed that 1429 patients with a history of colorectal adenoma were given low fiber (adding 2.0 g of wheat bran/d) and high fiber (adding 13.5 g of wheat bran/d) diet. the recurrence rate of colorectal adenomas was the same in both groups. the results were also supported by a large sample prospective cohort study by fuchs and giovannucci et al. this is a health survey of 121,700 registered nurses (all women) in the united states since 1976. from 1980 onwards, the diet of each woman was investigated in a questionnaire form, and 88,777 subjects (34 to 59 years old) who met the study criteria were followed up until 1996. in the 16-year study group, 787 cases of colon cancer occurred, and 27,530 people underwent colonoscopy, and 1012 cases of colorectal adenoma were found. after analyzing the above data, after adjusting for age, total energy intake and other known risk factors, it was found that dietary fiber intake was not associated with the risk of colon cancer, and the highest fiber intake was compared with the lowest 20%. the relative risk of colon cancer was 0.95 (95% ci: 0.73 to 1.25), and no dietary fiber intake was found to be associated with colon cancer. the cochrane center in oxford, england, collected a randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber interventions until october 2001. systemic reviews and meta-analysis were used to evaluate dietary fiber for the reduction and recurrence of colorectal adenomas. and the protective effect on colon cancer. there were 5 clinical trials that met the analytical criteria, including 4349 subjects. the analysis found that the relative risk of colorectal adenomas in the intervention group and the control group was observed by dietary supplementation with wheat bran or high-fiber diet for 2 to 4 years. ) is 1.04 (95% ci: 0.95 to 1.13), and the risk difference (rd) is 0.01 (95% ci: 0.02 to 0.04). the authors concluded that ""so far, randomized controlled clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to support the increased intake of dietary fiber, 2 to 4 years can reduce colorectal adenoma occurrence or recurrence between dietary nutrients due the interaction is very complicated, the type of diet is more important than the specific ingredients, and dietary intervention is often not effective due to the addition of a single factor. in addition, the occurrence and development of tumor is a long process, and dietary intervention is also a behavioral interventions, the protective effects of dietary fiber and other dietary ingredients need to be verified by more scientific, more rigorous design and long-term prospective studies. (2) chemoprevention chemoprevention is a new concept of tumor control proposed in recent years. , refers to the use of one or more natural or synthetic chemicals, chemopreventive agents (cpa) to prevent the occurrence of tumors. in a broad sense, dietary intervention is also a chemoprevention, because it is achieved through changes in eating habits, it can also be seen as a behavioral intervention. chemopreventive agents can inhibit and block the formation and absorption of carcinogens. and acting to prevent the occurrence of tumor suppressor and its development. according to the colon carcinogenesis model vogelstein, from normal colon mucosa, molecular biology through a series of events, in an intermediate stage of adenoma, malignant eventually completed, while the chemical prophylactic agents can repress or reverse the onset of adenomas or inhibit their progression to malignant lesions at different stages (figure 13). 1 aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: aspirin and other nonsteroidal ant inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are the most widely studied colon cancer chemopreventive agents, the main mechanism is through irreversible acetylation and competitive inhibition ring oxidase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-1 and cox-2) block the synthesis of prostaglandins, promote tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibit tumor angiogenesis. thun et al. reported in 1991 that 662,424 people were taking aspirin between 1982 and 1989. infrequent use of those who died of colon cancer was 0.77 for men and 0.73 for women. the risk of male and female dying from colon cancer was further reduced to 0.60 and 0.58, respectively. in a 2-year follow-up survey of 47,900 medical staff, the relative risk of colon cancer was 0.68, as determined by a single survey, and the ※regular use§ determined by more than 3 surveys. the relative risk is further reduced to 0.35. in the nurses' health survey by giovannucci et al, the risk of colon cancer in asylum patients was found to be 0.62 among 89,446 female nurses, and the risk of taking 20 years or more was further reduced to 0.56. however, the role of aspirin in preventing colon cancer has not been demonstrated by randomized controlled clinical trials. in a trial of 22071 male medical staff using aspirin to prevent coronary heart disease, the relationship between aspirin and colon cancer was also analyzed. the data showed that the experimental group and the control group had no evidence of colon cancer, colon polyps or carcinoma in situ. significant differences, according to analysis, may be related to low doses of aspirin, short duration of administration or insufficient follow-up time. there are few reports on the protective effect of non-aspirin nsaids on colon cancer. a recent large-scale retrospective found that 104,217 elderly people over the age of 65 were taking prescriptions for non-aspirin nsaids from medicaid. the relative risk of colon cancer is 0.61, and of course, its role should be confirmed by well-designed prospective studies. 2 folic acid: folic acid is a micronutrient in the diet, rich in vegetables and fruits, epidemiological studies found that people with high folic acid intake have a low incidence of colon cancer, while decreased folic acid intake (often seen in large drinkers) increases risk of colon cancer and colorectal adenoma. studies have shown that diets containing large amounts of folic acid have a protective effect on colon cancer (male rr = 0.78, female rr = 0.91), while the effect of adding folic acid to the diet is more pronounced (male rr = 0.63, female rr = 0.66). ). in giovannucci's nurse health survey, women's daily intake of more than 400y8 folic acid has a significant protective effect on colon cancer (rr=0.25), but the protective effect should not appear until 15 years later, suggesting that folic acid is in the early stage of colon cancer. play a role. 3 calcium: case-control and cohort studies in the human body most showed that the application of high-calcium diet and calcium additive was negatively correlated with the occurrence of colon cancer and colorectal adenoma, but only some of the results were statistically significant. the main reason may be that the calcium intake is not accurately estimated or is related to other dietary factors. in recent years, baron et al reported that 930 patients with a history of colorectal adenoma were randomized to receive calcium supplements (3 g/d calcium carbonate, 1.2 g calcium) or placebo. colonoscopy was performed at 1 and 4 years after the start of the study. the incidence of adenoma in the calcium group was decreased, which was significantly different from the placebo group (rr=0.85). moreover, the protective effect of calcium additive was 1 after taking the drug. it can be observed in years. 4 estrogen: in the past 20 years, the mortality rate of colon cancer in males in the united states has been decreasing, while women are more obvious. one explanation is that women use hormone replacement therapy extensively after menopause. the mechanism by which estrogen prevents colon cancer may be related to reducing secondary bile acid production, decreasing insulin growth factor-1, or directly acting on intestinal mucosal epithelium. according to calle et al, colon cancer mortality was significantly lower in women who received hormone replacement therapy (rr = 0.71), and more significant in patients who continued to use it for more than 11 years (rr = 0.54). similar results were found in the nurses' health study (rr = 0.65), but the protective effects of hormones disappeared 5 years after discontinuation. the results of two meta-analyses published in recent years have also shown that hormone replacement therapy can reduce the overall risk of colon cancer by 20%. the above observations suggest that the protective effect of estrogen may occur in the late stage of colon cancer. 5 vitamins and antioxidants: vitamins and antioxidants in vegetables and fruits have been thought to reduce the incidence of colon cancer for many years, but many prospective studies do not support this hypothesis. for example, nurse health research, doctor health research, etc. have not found the addition of beta carotene to the diet, vitamin a, b, d or e for colon cancer. in a randomized controlled trial, 864 patients with a history of colorectal adenoma were given a placebo, beta carotene, vitamin c and vitamin e, and beta carotene and vitamins c and e. colonoscopy was performed 1 year and 4 years later, and no difference was found in the 4 groups of adenomas. (3) treatment of precancerous lesions precancerous lesions of colon cancer are generally considered to include adenomatous polyps, ulcerative colitis, and crohn's disease, and adenomas are particularly closely related to colon cancer. epidemiology, animal experiments, and clinical and pathological studies have confirmed that the vast majority of colon cancers are cancerous from adenomas, especially large, villous, and adenomas with severe atypical hyperplasia. according to morson's study, if the colorectal adenoma is not removed, colon cancer can occur in 4% of patients within 5 years, and 14% can be cancerous within 10 years. stryker et al also demonstrated that untreated colorectal adenoma patients can have a colon cancer rate of up to 24% within 20 years. therefore, early detection and timely treatment of colorectal adenoma is an ideal way to prevent and reduce the occurrence of colon cancer. gilbertsen began to perform sigmoidoscopy (hard-slice) examinations every year for asymptomatic people over 45 years old in the 1950s. he found that polyps were removed. a total of 18,158 people were examined in 25 years, and only 13 cases of low colon cancer occurred in the tested population. and both are early, which is 85% lower than the expected 75-80 cases. in 1976, lee analyzed the trend of colorectal cancer in the united states for 25 years. the incidence of colon cancer increased significantly while rectal cancer decreased by 23%. in the 1950s, rectal cancer accounted for 55% of colon cancer, while in the 1970s it was only 30.7%. it is believed that the cause of the reduction in rectal cancer is likely to be the result of extensive sigmoidoscopy and active treatment of low adenomas found. in zhejiang province medical university from 1977 to 1980, colon cancer screening was conducted in haining city over 30 years old. two screenings completed 238 826 cases of 15cm colonoscopy, and 4076 cases of low colorectal polyps were found. 1410 cases of adenoma were surgically removed. by 1998, a total of 6 colonoscopy or 60cm fiber sigmoidoscopy (after 1988) were followed up. all the polyps detected were removed. according to haining tumor registration data, the city's average rectal cancer from 1992 to 1996. morbidity and mortality were 41% and 29% lower than those from 1977 to 1981, respectively. however, the value of removing precancerous lesions for colon cancer prevention remains to be confirmed by more rigorous clinical trials. to this end, the us nci funded a multi-center prospective clinical trial (national polyp study, nlps) involving seven units including the sloan-kettering memorial cancer center. in the nps, 9112 patients who underwent total colonoscopy between 1980 and 1990, 2632 patients with adenomas who met the study conditions, and 1418 patients with adenoma were randomly divided into 2 groups and followed up according to different examination frequency. at the time of total colonoscopy and barium enema, the average follow-up time was 5.9 years, during which only 5 asymptomatic early colon cancers (polyposis) were found, but no invasive colon cancer. the incidence of colon cancer in this group was reduced by 90% and 88%, respectively, compared with the two reference groups in patients with polyp history without surgical removal. the incidence of colon cancer in this group also decreased by 76% compared with the general population. this study fully supports the idea that colorectal adenoma can develop into colorectal adenocarcinoma, and it proves that the treatment of precancerous lesions can prevent the occurrence of colon cancer. 2, secondary prevention screening for high-risk population of colon cancer, in order to find asymptomatic preclinical tumor patients. early diagnosis and early treatment can improve the survival rate of patients and reduce the mortality rate of the population. because screening can not only find early colon cancer, but also found precancerous adenomatous polyps of colon cancer, so that it can be treated in time to prevent cancer. in this sense, screening is both a secondary prevention measure for colon cancer and an effective primary prevention measure. the natural history of colon cancer is long. from the development of precancerous lesions to invasive tumors, it is necessary to undergo molecular biological events such as multiple gene deletions and mutations. it is estimated that it takes 10 to 15 years, which provides for screening for early lesions. opportunity. early colon cancer has a good prognosis. according to the us nci disease surveillance (seer) data, the 5-year survival rate of carcinoma in situ was 94.1% and the local lesion (dukes'a) was 84.6% in 59,537 colon cancers from 1978 to 1983. when there is a distant transfer, it drops to 5.7%. the 5-year survival rates of dukes a, b, c, and d in 1385 colon cancers in shanghai cancer hospital were 93.9%, 74.0%, 48.3%, and 0.31%, respectively. however, the proportion of a+b in the general clinical cases is usually only about 40%, while the c+d period is as high as 60%. armitage reports that dukes' phase a only accounts for 6% in most hospitals in the uk. because early colon cancer is mostly asymptomatic or the symptoms are not obvious, it has been confirmed that screening can increase the detection rate of early cases, and can also find precancerous lesions and timely treatment, thereby reducing the incidence of colon cancer. it is concluded that screening for colon cancer may reduce the mortality rate of the population. in the united states, the mortality rate of colon cancer decreased by 20.5% from 1973 to 1995, and the incidence rate decreased by 7.4%, especially after 1986. it is generally believed that this may be related to the widespread development of colon cancer screening and polyps found by colonoscopy. it is unlikely to be the result of changes in diet and lifestyle. recently, the united states nci, the united states preventive service task force (uspstf) and the american gastroenterological association have commonly used screening methods for colon cancer, including: anal finger test, fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, the use of gastroenterology and colonoscopy has been evaluated, and this is the most authoritative and comprehensive review of the evidence for the effectiveness of colon cancer screening. (1) anal finger examination is easy and easy to detect. it can be found in the rectum 8cm away from the anus. about 30% of colorectal cancer in the country is within this range, but only 10% of colorectal cancer in europe and america can be diagnosed by anal finger. and. the detection rate of polyps in the sigmoid colonoscopy (15-18 cm) of colon cancer in haining city in china was 1.7%, while the anus was only 0.17%. in addition, when the large-scale examination, the examiner's swelling and sensation of the fingertips failed, resulting in a decrease in the detection rate. a case-control study in the united states showed that patients who died of distal rectal cancer between the ages of 45 and 1971 between 1971 and 1986 had no difference in the rate of anal examinations 1 year before diagnosis compared with the control group (or= 0.96). therefore, anal digital examination has a limited effect as a screening method, but it is an essential part of a full physical examination for symptomatic patients. (2) fecal occult blood test intestinal invasive hemorrhage is the most common early symptom of colon cancer and colorectal adenoma. since greegor first used fobt to screen colon cancer in 1967, fobt has been applied for its economy, simplicity and safety. the most extensive screening method for colon cancer, the existing methods of occult blood test are mainly chemical and immunological methods. in the chemical method, hemoccult ii (smith kline diagnostics) is the most widely used and most studied. it uses the peroxidase-like activity of heme to react with guaiac in the presence of h2o2 to produce blue color; therefore, animal blood, red meat and some vegetables such as carrots, turnips, broccoli and certain drugs such as iron non-steroidal antipyretic and analgesic drugs can also produce false positive reactions. it is generally believed that the normal human intestinal gastrointestinal bleeding volume is less than 2ml per day, while the detection sensitivity of hemoccult ii is 4-6ml/100g stool, so fobt positive indicates pathological bleeding. ransohoff and lang systematically evaluated fobt: the sensitivity of a single unhydrated fobt screening colon cancer was 40%, the specificity was 96% to 98%, and the sensitivity after hydration increased to 50% to 60%, but specificity decreased to 90%. recently, lieberman et al reported that hydration fobt screening for colon cancer sensitivity is 50% (95% ci: 30% to 70%), for cancer and precancerous lesions (large villi-like with atypical hyperplasia) the adenocarcinoma has a sensitivity of 24% (95% ci, 19% to 29%) and a specificity of 94% (95% ci, 93% to 95%). in the western countries, the fobt positive rate was 2% under controlled diet conditions, and among fobt positive patients, about 10% were colon cancer and 30% were polyps. however, the false positive rate of the chemical method fobt (benzidine method) in the normal population of china's census can be as high as 12.10% (23706/206125), which greatly limits its application value, which may be related to other gastrointestinal bleeding diseases such as gastritis. gastric ulcer, gastric cancer and high prevalence of sputum are related. the earliest clinical trial of fobt screening for colon cancer was hosted by the sloan-kettering memorial cancer center from 1975 to 1985. 21,756 asymptomatic individuals over 40 years of age were screened, randomized to the screening group and the control group, in the colon among the cancers, 65% of the screening group were dukes'a and b, while the control group was only 33%; the 10-year survival rate of the screening group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p<0.001), and the colon of the screening group was followed up for 10 years. the cancer mortality rate was 43% lower than that of the control group (p=0.053). the study showed an increase in the proportion of early cancer, prolonged survival and decreased colon cancer death. the effect of fobt on screening for colon cancer can reduce colon cancer mortality, which has been demonstrated by at least three well-designed large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials (table 6), which is class i evidence, so the uspstf prioritizes it as a. class recommendations (ie strongly recommended) are used for crowd screening. (3) immunology fobt was developed in the late 1970s. the specific immune response of hemoglobin and corresponding antibodies avoids the disadvantages of chemical methods that limit diet and improves the specificity and sensitivity of screening. in 1987, zhejiang medical university successfully developed the reverse indirect hemagglutination (rpha-fobt) kit. in haining city and jiashan county, zhejiang province, a group of 3034 high-risk populations with a history of rectal polyps were screened for rpha fobt. 11 cases of colorectal malignant tumor, 465 cases of polyps (195 cases of adenoma), with 60cm fiber enteroscopy as the reference standard, proved that the sensitivity of rpha-fobt screening for colon cancer was 63.6%, specificity was 81.9%, youden the index is 0.46, which is superior to the chemical method. the study also showed that the sensitivity of rpha-fobt screening polyps was only 22.1%, but it was about 40% positive for villous and tubular villous adenomas with a high malignant tendency. on this basis, zheng shu et al. performed a colon cancer screening on 75,813 people over the age of 30 in jiashan county, a high incidence area of colon cancer. the total positive rate of rpha-fobt was 4.2%, and 21 cases of colon were screened. dukes' a and b in cancer accounted for 71.4%. a variety of immunological fobt reagents are available in the united states, such as heme (#sel#), insure, and flexsureobt, which use monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against human hemoglobin to detect fecal occult blood. one test for a high-risk group of 240 colon cancers with insure tm reagent showed that insuretm was 87% (20/23) sensitive for screening for colon cancer and 47.4% sensitive for >10 mm adenomas. (9/19), the specificity of detection in a group of normal people over 40 years old was 97.9% (88/98), and the specificity of the normal population under 30 years old was 97.8% (92/94). studies have shown that the immunological method fobt including insuretm does not react with myoglobin, animal hemoglobin, is not interfered by diet and drugs, and is negative for feces of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. recently, the american cancer society (acs) colon cancer advisory group evaluated the available evidence that immunological fobt can increase the specificity of screening compared to chemical fobt, adding the following in the 2003 acs colon cancer screening guidelines. description: ""in the detection of fecal occult blood, the immunological occult blood test is easy for patients to accept, its sensitivity and specificity is better than or at least the same as thexyloestermethod."" (4) gilbertsensigmoidoscopybegan in the early 1950s colonoscopy and polyps were screened by sigmoidoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy (25 cm hard) was performed on 18,158 patients. after 25 years of follow-up, the incidence of sigmoid colon and rectal cancer in the screening group was compared with the national average. significant decline. due to the difficulty in inserting the rigid colonoscopy, the patient acceptance rate is low. since the invention of the optical fiber endoscopy in 1969, the 60cm fiberoptic colonoscopy was introduced into the clinic in 1976. now the 25cm hard lens has been replaced by a 60cm fiber enteroscopy. more than 80% of family physicians have equipped and used 60cm colonoscopy. the kaiser permanence multiphasic health checkup (mhc) in the united states randomly divided 10,713 people aged 35 to 54 into trials and controls. among the 5156 people who were screened, 20 cases of colon cancer were detected, and dukes' a stage accounted for 60%. after 16 years of follow-up, the 5-year survival rate was 90%, and the 10-year survival rate was 80%. the control group dukes 'a phase is only 48%, and the 10-year survival rate is also 48%. the number of colon cancer deaths in the experimental group was significantly smaller than that in the control group (12 and 29, respectively). however, further analysis found that, if only the colon cancer mortality rate was within the range that can be achieved by colonoscopy, the difference between the experimental group and the control group was not statistically significant. lieberman et al found that 70% to 80% of patients with distal colonic polyps in the fiberoptic colonoscopy also had new organisms in the proximal colon. a randomized controlled trial found that in patients with polyps detected by colonoscopy, the incidence of colon cancer was reduced by 80% after a complete colonoscopy and removal of the adenomas found. therefore, 60cm fiber enteroscopy for screening can not only remove precancerous lesions within the reach of the endoscope, and can be used as an indication for full colonoscopy, which can reduce the incidence of all colon cancer. experts believe that if colonoscopy is found to have polyps, the indications for further colonoscopy should be as follows: patients over 65 years old; villi or ≡1 cm or multiple adenomas; family history of colon cancer. according to the statistics of 3147 colon cancers in china, 82% occur below the splenic spleen, that is, the 60cm colonoscopy is accessible. therefore, its application value seems to be larger than that of western countries. the cancer research institute of zhejiang medical university used 60cm fiber enteroscopy as a rescreening method for sequential screening of colon cancer. 60cm colonoscopy was performed on 36.2 high-risk groups, and 21 cases of colon cancer and 331 polyps were found. in another group of 3034 high-risk subjects, 11 cases of colorectal malignant tumors and 563 cases of polyps were detected by 60cm colonoscopy. before the 60cm colonoscopy, mannitol powder and plenty of drinking water were used for intestinal preparation. the intestinal cleanliness was satisfactory or basically satisfactory in 95%, and all of the more than 6,000 colonoscopy examinations did not have a perforation. according to china's national conditions, 60cm fiber enteroscopy can not be used as a primary screening method, but as a simple, feasible and relatively reliable rescreening or diagnostic measures is still worth promoting. at least two case-control studies have shown that sigmoidoscopy can reduce the mortality of colon cancer. in selby's study, sigmoid colonoscopy is used, while newcomb's study is mainly fiberoptic colonoscopy. both studies showed that those who had had more than one colonoscopy had a 70% to 90% reduction in the risk of dying from distal colon and rectal cancer than those who had never had a microscopy. according to thiis-evensen et al., 799 subjects were randomly selected from the norwegian general population in 1983 and randomly divided into the colonoscopy group and the control group. 81% of the screening group received a colonoscopy, such as polyps. mirror. 13 years later (1996), 451 (71%) of the 2 groups underwent total colonoscopy and found no difference in the incidence of polyps between the screening group and the control group, but the screening group had high-risk polyps (≡1 cm, with atypical the incidence of hyperplasia was lower than that of the control group (rr=0.6, 95% ci: 0.3-1.0, p=0.07), and another 2 cases of colon cancer occurred in the registered screening group and 10 cases in the control group (rr=0.2, 95% ci: 0.03 to 0.95). however, because the overall mortality rate of the screening group is greater than that of the control group (mainly due to cardiovascular disease death), it is difficult to conclude that the colonoscopy screening is conducive to reducing the mortality rate of colon cancer. currently, the","risk factors clinically, certain factors may greatly increase the risk of morbidity. they include: 1. age of onset, most patients develop after 50 years of age. 2, family history: if a person's first-degree relatives, such as parents, have had colorectal cancer, he is 8 times more likely to suffer from this disease in his lifetime than the general population, about a quarter of new patients have a family history of colorectal cancer. 3, history of colon disease: some colon diseases such as crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis may increase the incidence of colorectal cancer, their risk of colon cancer is 30 times that of ordinary people. 4. polyps: most colorectal cancers develop from small precancerous lesions. they are called polyps. among them, villus-like adenomatous polyps are more likely to develop into cancer, and the chance of cacao becomes about 25%. tubular adenocarcinoma the polyposis rate is 1-5%. 5, genetic characteristics: some familial tumor syndrome, such as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, can significantly increase the incidence of colorectal cancer, and the onset time is younger. some colon cancer epidemiological studies have shown that social development status, lifestyle and dietary structure are closely related to colon cancer, and there are phenomena suggesting that there may be differences in the environment and genetic factors affecting the incidence of colon cancer in different parts and age groups. environment (especially diet), genetics, physical activity, occupation, etc., are possible etiological factors affecting the incidence of colon cancer. epidemiological studies have shown that 70% to 90% of cancer incidence is related to environmental factors and lifestyle, and 40% to 60% of environmental factors are related to diet and nutrition to some extent, so diet in the onset of cancer factors are seen as extremely important factors. 1, high-fat, high-protein, low-cellulose mechanism of action: can be summarized as follows: 1 affect intestinal lipid metabolism, high-fat diet increased 7a-dehydroxylation enzyme activity, resulting in increased secondary bile acid formation, while fiber the effect of the element is opposite, and by inhibiting reabsorption, dilution and adsorption, chelation, reducing the deoxycholic acid concentration in the intestine, increasing the solid phase material in the feces and promoting the discharge; some dietary factors (such as calcium ions) can reduce the intestinal tract. the levels of ionized fatty acids and free bile acids, both of which have an damaging effect on the intestinal epithelium; inhibit the degradation of intestinal cholesterol. milk, lactose and galactose have the effect of inhibiting the redox effect of cholane. 2 cellulose also has the effect of changing the intestinal flora, affecting the structure and function of intestinal mucosa, affecting the growth rate of mucosal epithelial cells, mediating the ph of the intestine, and strengthening the mucosal barrier through mucin to reduce intestinal toxic substances to the intestine. invasion of the epithelium; 3 high fat and some carbohydrates can increase the activity of intestinal cell enzymes (such as glucuronidase, ornithine dehydrogenase, nitroreductase, azolasin, lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase) ), promote the production of carcinogens and auxiliary cancers. 4 the effect of biological macromolecular activity. when the cytoplasm is acidified, dna synthesis is inhibited and the cell cycle is prolonged. 2, vitamins: case-control study showed that carotene, vitamin b2, vitamin c, vitamin e are related to the reduction of the relative risk of colon cancer, and a dose-response relationship. vitamin d and calcium have a protective effect. 3, onion and garlic: onion and garlic foods have been widely concerned about the protection of the body, and in the experiment repeatedly confirmed the inhibition of this type of food on tumor growth. garlic oil can significantly reduce colonic mucosal cell damage caused by dimethyl cholestyramine, and can reduce the colon cancer induction rate of mice by 75%. according to the case-control study, the risk of colon cancer in high-intake garlic foods was 74% in the low-intake group. 4. salt and preserved foods: the relationship between salt content and gastric cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer. in the high salt intake group, the relative risk of the three cancers increased, and the case-control study suggested a weekly intake of 3 the excess risk of colon cancer in the above-mentioned cured foods was 2.2 times (p<0.01) for less than one time, 2.1 times for left colon cancer, and 1.8 times for right colon cancer. the explanation for this risk factor may be related to the carcinogens produced during the food pickling process, and high salt intake may be a concomitant state. 5, tea: tea polyphenols is a strong antioxidant, can inhibit the carcinogenic effect of carcinogens. according to the case-control study, the risk of rectal cancer in drinking tea (green tea or black tea) more than 3 times per week was 75% of that of less than one, but not related to the colon cancer group. in the past 10 years, the study suggests that tea drinking has a significant negative correlation with the risk of colon cancer, but there are also reports of the opposite. because of the small number of studies on the protective effect of tea drinking on colon cancer prevention, it is difficult to evaluate the role of tea drinking in the pathogenesis of human colon cancer. the relationship between coffee and colon cancer is still difficult to determine. 6. trace elements and minerals: 1 selenium: the mortality rate of various cancers (including colon cancer) is negatively correlated with local dietary selenium intake and soil selenium content. it is speculated that selenium and potassium are associated with a low risk of colon cancer. however, it is believed that these factors may be just some accompanying factors, and do not directly affect the risk of colon cancer in the population. 2 calcium: animal experiments have shown that calcium can improve the toxic effects of deoxycholic acid on intestinal epithelium. some scholars believe that the increase of the concentration of bile acids and free fatty acids in the intestine can promote the occurrence of colon cancer, and calcium can be combined with them to form insoluble saponified compounds, so that their effects on intestinal epithelial stimulation and toxicity are alleviated. some epidemiological studies have also suggested that calcium intake can prevent the development of colon cancer. insulated asbestos production workers are more common in colon cancer patients, and animal experiments have shown that swallowing asbestos fibers can penetrate the intestinal mucosa. in addition, the metal industry, cotton yarn or textile industry and leather manufacturing. it has been confirmed that in the production process of plastics, synthetic fibers and rubber, a compound which is often used - acrylonitrile has a role in inducing the stomach, central nervous system and breast tumors, and textile workers exposed to the substance, lung cancer and colon the incidence of cancer is high. despite this, colon cancer is generally not considered an occupational disease. in the analysis of occupational physical activity, it is found that the risk of colon cancer in long-term or frequent sitting is 1.4 times that of some major physical activity, and it is more closely related to cecal cancer. as a result of case-control studies, moderate-intensity physical activity has a protective effect against colon cancer, especially colon cancer. it is estimated that genetic factors may play an important role in at least 20% to 30% of colon cancer patients, including 1% of familial polyposis and 5% of hereditary polypoid-free colon cancer syndrome. 80% to 100% of patients with hereditary familial polyposis may develop malignant tumors after 59 years of age. in addition, patients with familial colonic polyposis have a majority of left colon cancer, while patients with hereditary nonpolyposis often have right colon cancer. through the case-control pedigree survey of the whole population (1328 cases of colon cancer probands and 1451 population control families), the results showed that the prevalence of colon cancer in the first-degree relatives of different proband groups was significantly higher than that of the second-degree relatives. the age at diagnosis of colon cancer proband is related to the risk of colon cancer in the first-degree relatives. the younger the proband is, the greater the relative risk of colon cancer in the first-degree relatives of the family. the relative risk is six times that of the >55 age group. family members (first-degree relatives) with a family history of colon cancer, especially those with a colon cancer age of 40 years or younger, should be given high priority. 1, intestinal inflammation and polyps: intestinal chronic inflammation and polyps, adenoma and suffering from extensive ulcerative colitis for more than 10 years: the risk of colon cancer is several times higher than the general population. patients with ulcerative colitis with severe dysplasia have a 50% chance of developing colon cancer. obviously, patients with ulcerative colitis have a higher risk of developing colon cancer than the general population. the data in china suggest that the risk of colon cancer in patients with onset of disease for more than 5 years is 2.6 times higher than that of the general population, but not closely related to rectal cancer. for patients with limited and intermittent lesions, the risk of colon cancer is small. crohn's disease is also a chronic inflammatory disease that invades the small intestine and sometimes the colon. a growing body of evidence suggests that crohn's disease is associated with colon and small bowel adenocarcinoma, but to a lesser extent than ulcerative colitis. 2. schistosomiasis: according to the retrospective investigation of cancer deaths in zhejiang province from 1974 to 1976 and the survey data of chinese malignant tumors from 1975 to 1978 and the chinese schistosomiasis atlas, the relationship between schistosomiasis endemic areas and colon cancer incidence and mortality was discussed. correlation. there is a very significant correlation between the incidence of schistosomiasis and the mortality rate of colon cancer in 12 counties and autonomous regions in southern china and 10 counties in jiaxing, zhejiang province. it is suggested that in areas where schistosomiasis is seriously endemic in china, schistosomiasis may be associated with high incidence of colon cancer. however, there is little evidence from epidemiological studies about colon cancer and schistosomiasis. for example, in jiashan county, zhejiang province, which is increasingly controlled by schistosomiasis, the mortality rate of colon cancer and the incidence of schistosomiasis in this area have been the highest in china, and the infection rate of schistosomiasis has decreased significantly. however, according to recent survey results, epidemiological and pathological studies of colon polyp carcinogenesis also suggest that polyp carcinogenesis has nothing to do with the presence or absence of schistosomiasis eggs in polyps. in addition, the results of the colon cancer screening conducted in the above two regions do not support schistosomiasis as a risk factor for colon cancer. in the case-control study, no history of schistosomiasis was found to correlate with colon cancer. 3, cholecystectomy: in recent years, there are about 20 literatures in china about the relationship between cholecystectomy and colon cancer. some of these studies have shown that after cholecystectomy can increase the risk of colon cancer, especially proximal colon cancer. men have an increased risk of colon cancer after cholecystectomy; in contrast, women have a lower risk of developing rectal cancer after the procedure. there are also views that the effect of cholecystectomy on female colon cancer is greater than that of men. it is generally believed that the occurrence of tumors is the result of a combination of factors, and colon cancer is no exception. colon cancer, as a disease closely related to the lifestyle of western society, is closely related to its etiology, and it is considered that the role of dietary factors is the most important. the etiology of ※high fat, high protein, high calorie and lack of cellulose intake§ is still dominant, and most of the results are consistent with this model. other carcinogenic factors have relatively weak effects, such as disease factors, genetic factors, and occupational factors. it can be considered that the carcinogenic process of colon cancer is based on the role of dietary factors, combined with the results of multiple links of other factors. with the deepening of etiology and the penetration of multidisciplinary, there is now a new understanding of the carcinogenic mechanism of colon cancer. in the field of epidemiology, modern technology is more widely used, and some factors that are not consistent with previous results are more deeply understood, and the possible causes of epidemiological results will be further clarified. pathogenesis 1. pathogenesis based on modern biology and epidemiology, it is increasingly clear that colon cancer is the result of synergy between environment, diet and living habits and genetic factors. the role of carcinogens combined with cellular genetic background leads to cytogenetic mutations gradually develop into cancer. because of the long course of colon cancer, and some have obvious stages of precancerous lesions of adenoma, colon cancer has become an ideal model for studying the pathogenesis of tumors and the pathogenesis of malignant tumors. in terms of etiology, in addition to genetic factors, other factors are classified into two categories according to the changes in cytogenetic, namely: genotoxic carcinogens and non-genotoxic carcinogens. colon cancer is formed by multiple factors and multiple stages, and various molecular events develop. various factors can be classified into endogenous and exogenous factors, and the occurrence of tumors is the result of internal and external interactions. external factors are nothing more than physical and biological factors, genetic or acquired genetic instability, microsatellite instability and chromosomal instability. in the gradual development and progression of colon cancer, molecular events can be primary genetic events and secondary molecular events. the former is a mutation in the gene structure, and the latter is a change in gene expression during the development and evolution, and does not involve changes in gene structure, such as changes in protein, enzyme levels, and phosphorylation, acetylation or glycosylation in translational modifications. malignant tumors are increasingly clear in the concept of a class of cytogenetic diseases. in the pathogenesis and pathogenesis of colon cancer, different genetic backgrounds have different susceptibility, which also determines the characteristics of colon cancer pathogenesis. the following three aspects describe the malignant transformation process of colon cancer. (1) malignant transformation process of colon cancer: the malignant transformation process is the whole process of primary genetic events, and a group of genotoxic carcinogens, ie, carcinogen promoters, initiates multiple attacks on cells, resulting in dna mutations occur in the corresponding genes, and the genotype changes, leading to genetic transformation of the cells - cancer. in colon cancer, morphologically, its phenotype includes epithelial hyperplasia, adenoma formation, carcinoma in situ, and invasion and metastasis of cancer. some colon cancers are derived from adenomas. adenomas may undergo a long period of time from the onset to the formation and associated with atypical hyperplasia, which is beneficial for observation and research. therefore, more oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in molecular events have been discovered. . the apc gene (adenomatous polyposis coli) and c-myc gene are the primary genetic events involved in the adenoma stage. cancerous changes occur in adenomas, but also in flat mucosa. molecular events of hyperplasia of the epithelium include genes related to the adenoma stage, involving a total of at least 9 to 10 gene molecular events, which can be summarized as dominant oncogenes and recessive anti-cancer genes 2 major categories. 1 dominant proto-oncogene: generally a positive regulator of normal cell growth, a single allele mutation sufficient to cause a change in cell phenotype, ie, genetic structure changes. even if the gene is mutated only on a single chromosome, its phenotypic change can be caused. ac-myc gene: is a pre-adenomas mutated gene, located in the 8q24 segment, about 70% of colon cancer, especially in the left colon cancer, c-myc overexpression can be several times to tens of times. its expression level is also high in normal cells with fast growth, which indicates that it plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation. the apc gene is intrinsically linked to the overexpression of c-myc. none of the c-myc mutants have apc gene loss, and the c-myc gene also has the function of regulating the ras gene. b.ras gene: colorectal adenoma larger than 1cm adenoma has a 50% chance of detecting point mutations in at least 1 of the ras gene family (h-ras, k-ras and n-ras), at <1cm the point mutation is about 10%, and the mutation rate is directly related to the degree of atypical adenoma. it can be used as a signal for adenoma with malignant potential. therefore, the degree of malignancy and the prognosis are estimated by the mutation detection rate. the vast majority of ras gene mutations occur in the 12th and 13th codons of the ki-ras gene, accounting for 88% of all mutant codons, and the other common site is the 61st codon. in the chinese colon cancer study, the two cell lines hr8348 and hce8693 were the 12th codon of ki-ras, and the second gLc base was converted. in 37 cases of chinese colon cancer cells, 37% have ki-rar gene fragments, and china has successfully detected the mutant ki-ras gene fragment in the feces of 33.3% (6/18) colon cancer patients by non-radioactive nuclides. provides possibilities for molecular diagnosis. 2 receptive tumor suppressor gene: a negative regulator, when a single allele is deleted or mutated, the corresponding gene on the other chromosome can still maintain its normal function of the normal phenotype, only in the 2 alleles in the absence or mutation, the dysfunction of the gene, phenotypic changes, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and canceration. a. apc gene: the apc gene was first discovered in the familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) and cloned at 5q21. fap is autosomal dominant syndrome, fap can be associated with extra-colonary lesions, such as gardner syndrome with bone disease or fibrosis, turcot syndrome with brain tumor, genetic deletion of chromosome 5q21, allelic loss (loss of heterozygosity). loss of this gene is also present in 35% to 60% of patients with no family history of colon cancer. b. mutation of the mcc (mutated in colorectal cancer) gene: the mcc gene is also located at 5q2l, which is close to the apc gene locus, and there are structurally similar fragments in the structure. however, there are few mcc gene mutations in the fap family, and about 15% of sporadic colon cancers are inactivated by somatic mutations, and mutations occur on gc base pairs (gcLat). c. dcc ((#del#)d in colorectal cancer) gene deletion or mutation: about 50% of late adenomas and more than 70% of colon cancers can be detected with loss of heterozygosity in chromosome 18q21 region. that is, the dcc gene is a large gene, which is more than 70kd. its function has not yet been completely determined. the inactivation of dcc gene in colon cancer is likely to cause the recognition of extracellular information molecules from other cells, extracellular matrix or soluble molecules. change to obtain some malignant phenotypes. d.p53 gene: the human p53 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.1) and is 16-20kd long. it consists of 11 exons and encodes a nucleoprotein of 393 amino acids. its molecular weight is 53kd. and got its name. it is currently the most studied tumor suppressor gene and is generally associated with various types of tumors. chromosome 17 short arm allele loss (17p) occurs in 75% of colon cancers, but is rare in adenomas. the naturally occurring wild-type p53 (wt-p53) gene maintains normal cell cycle and regulates cell cycle progression. in recent years, there have been many studies on apoptosis. apoptosis, also known as progressive programmed cell death, is a mechanism of cell self-destruction. it can counteract the accumulation of abnormal cells during tumor formation, so inhibition of apoptosis will lead to tumorigenesis. wt-p53 is involved in the induction of apoptosis. wt-p53 is mutated, rearranged, translocated in most tumors, and its p53 protein function is inhibited. inactivation of wt-p53 causes the proliferation of colorectal mucosal epithelial cells to become cancerous. in primary genetic events, genes involved in colon cancer include dominant oncogenes and recessive negative regulatory tumor suppressor genes. for example, according to their function, they can be classified into two categories, namely genes related to the replication signaling pathway and guarantees. the genes correctly replicated by dna, the former are ki-ras, apc and dcc, and the latter are hmsh2, hmlh1, hpms1, hpms2 and p53. at present, we can see the understanding of the mechanism of action of various genes. (2) the malignant evolution process of colon cancer: the malignant evolution, that is, the diffusion process of tumor invasion and metastasis, that is, the secondary molecular event, is the result of the gene expression product. under the action of these substances or factors, the growth of carcinoma in situ is out of control, and it is infiltrated, spread and metastasized from normal cells or surrounding cells, leading to a malignant progression. the evolution of colon cancer is similar to that of other tumors, and can have the following major changes: 1 colon cancer cells overgrow and get rid of normal growth patterns. this process includes functional changes such as growth factors, protooncogenes, and metastasis suppressor genes. it has been confirmed that colon cancer cells can produce angiogenin and basic fibroblast growth factor (b-fgf), transforming growth factor alpha and 汕 (tgf-汐, tgf-汕), synergistic, enriches blood supply, and provides conditions for rapid tumor growth. 2 the related receptors of cancer cells adhering to the basement membrane and matrix molecules are changed. the infiltration of cancer cells firstly contacts the cells and attaches to the basement membrane, penetrates to reach the surrounding matrix, and then moves to the outer wall of the blood vessels and enters the blood vessels, depending on the components. receptor-ligend interaction between receptors. in the interaction between the binding proteins on colon cancer cells and normal epithelial cells and matrices, the relevant binding proteins are identical, only the difference in expression levels, there is a specific protein in the attachment of colon cancer cells to the basement membrane and matrix molecules. body: a. non-integrated laminin binding protein; molecular weight 67kd protein, exists in the bottom cell membrane, and has high affinity with laminin. another protein has a molecular weight of 32 kd and also has high affinity. both of these binding proteins have increased expression in colon metastatic carcinoma and are associated with dukes stage progression. b. integrin: is a family of cell surface receptors composed of a combination of 汐 and 汕 peptide chains, which can specifically bind to laminin, collagen and fibronectin, and mediate cells. - a group of receptors for cells, cells, and extracellular matrices that are involved in cell growth, differentiation, formation of junctions, and cell polarity. c. lectin: the molecular weight of the protein that specifically binds to sugar or oligosaccharide is 31kd, which is significantly elevated in cancer cells, and is not expressed in benign tumors. it is significantly correlated with serum cea levels, and is also associated with tumor progression. consistent. in addition, the related receptor cd44 in lymphocytes is also expressed in epithelial cells, which are divided into epithelial cell type and lymphocyte type cd44, which are the main receptors for recognition of hyaluronidase, and can also bind to the basement membrane and matrix proteins. cd44 is significantly higher in colon cancer than in adjacent normal mucosa. 3 from the basement membrane and matrix, cancer cells immersed in the bloodstream or lymphatic flow, constitute infiltration and metastasis: the change of proteases is the basis of its molecular events, colon cancer cells can be autocrine protease: a. type iv collagenase: colon cancer at least it can produce three kinds of collagenases with molecular weights of 64kd, 72kd and 92kd, which can be higher than normal mucosa, can degrade type iv collagen, fibrin and laminin, but can not degrade type i and type iii collagen in interstitial. . b urokinase: is a plasminogen activator, colon cancer can secrete urokinase, its production is negatively correlated with tumor differentiation, and colorectal adenoma and cancer are higher than normal. 4 the tumor cells are directly inoculated on the surface of the cavity after detachment, and the molecular changes are: colon cancer cells secrete a kind of ligand, which binds to receptors of the lining cells of the epithelial space involved in metastasis, thereby forming planting, ligands including cancer cells. antigen, mucus or blood group antigen. (3) genetic susceptibility of colon cancer: due to external factors and genetic background, the occurrence and development of malignant tumors objectively formed some high-incidence populations or susceptible populations. 1 deletion or mutation of colon cancer suppressor gene: tumor suppressor gene mutation, corresponding cell growth and detachment regulation, resulting in cancerous growth, in the colon cancer, apc, dcc and p53 and other tumor suppressor genes are deleted, highly susceptible to carcinogens the blows formed a group of susceptible populations, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) and gardner syndrome (gs) family members, all of which are potential colon cancer susceptibility. in 1985, herrer found that 5q13~15 and 5q15~22 were partially missing in a patient with gs. in 1981, solomon found that the lymphocyte allele was absent in patients with sporadic colon cancer, ie apc and mcc. the apc gene mutation occurred in 60%~ 87% of patients with fap and gs. mcc mutations were only found in sporadic colon cancer with a mutation of approximately 15%. the apc gene mutation is the earliest molecular event currently detectable in somatic cells. dry moon wave et al. (1994) detected 2 cases of apc gene mutations in fap pedigree members in chinese peripheral lymphocytes (22 years and 24 years old). two cases of fap patients confirmed by fiber enteroscopy, so screening can be applied to families with genetic background for early detection, which is an effective measure for early treatment. 2 dna damage repair system defects: according to genetic epidemiological studies, colon cancer has a family agglomeration phenomenon, in addition to fap and gs, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (hnpcc) accounts for 3% to 30% of colon cancer %. in recent years, six genes have been found to be associated with hnpcc. hmlh1, hmsh2, hpms1, hpms2, hmsh3 and gtbp/hmsh6 genes can be isolated from this family, and compared with the dna mismatch repair system in e. coli and yeast. . mutations in any of the genes in the system result in defects or loss of cell mismatch repair function, resulting in increased accumulation of various spontaneous or non-spontaneous mutations in the cell, which in turn leads to replication errors and genetic instability. recent studies have found that there is genetic instability in most hnpcc patients, manifested as replication error (rer), a single or 2 to 6 nucleotide repeat in genomic dna. the length of the sequence has changed. according to the literature, the positive rate of rer in colon cancer of hnpcc patients is as high as 86%-100%, and the positive rate of rer in extra-colonal malignant tumors is 100%, while the positive rate of general sporadic colon cancer is only 12% to 16%, the two have significant differences. combined with the study of mismatch repair system in e. coli and yeast, it is thought that the defect or loss of dna mismatch repair function caused by mutation of mismatch repair gene (mmr) is the main cause of replication error, and thus may also it is the main cause of hnpcc. 3 genetic instability and susceptibility to colon cancer: hnpcc is a common autosomal dominant hereditary disease. in general, hnpcc includes the following two types: one is hereditary site-specific colon cancer (hsscc), also known as lynchi syndrome. at least 3 of the two generations have colon cancer, at least 1 of which occurred before the age of 50. these patients have an earlier onset age than normal colon cancer, 70% of which are located in the proximal colon; it is a cancer family syndrome (cfs), also known as lynch ii syndrome. in addition to the characteristics of hscc, it also shows a high incidence of colorectal malignant tumors. the most common is endometrial cancer, and other stomachs. transitional cell carcinoma of the small intestine, ovary, adenocarcinoma of the biliary system and the urinary system. using a variety of microsatellite markers, extensively (3/11) of hnpccs have been found to have erroneous repetitive dna sequences such as single to four nucleotide repeats (ca) n or (cag)n in hnpcc linkage analysis. it has also been found in colon cancer, but the number is small (6/46), suggesting frequent errors in the development of colon cancer, suggesting its genetic instability, and is also a group of susceptible people. regardless of whether (ca)n, (cag)n is the cause or the result, its appearance and existence show its susceptibility characteristics. the idea that hnpcc is involved in mutations in mismatch repair genes has been confirmed by more and more studies. most scholars believe that mutations in mismatch repair genes are early events in the process of carcinogenesis. according to vogelstein's colon cancer model, tumorigenesis is a multi-gene, multi-stage process involving the inactivation of many tumor suppressor genes and the activation of oncogenes. the relationship between the mutation of the mismatch repair gene and the changes of these genes, and how it ultimately leads to the formation of cancer, the mechanism is still unclear. it has been reported that in colon cancer patients, genetic instability caused by defects in mismatch repair function causes colonic epithelial cells to lose response to tgf-mediated growth inhibition mechanism, thereby promoting tumor formation. but this is only one of the possible mechanisms, and further research is still needed. the solution of these problems can help us to understand the occurrence and development of hnpcc more clearly, so as to help subclinical diagnosis and early diagnosis by detecting certain genes, and to provide early intervention and treatment to reduce the incidence of hnpcc and improve the survival rate. .

acute gastric mucosal lesions,"acute gastric mucosal lesions are lesions characterized by varying degrees of erosion, shallow ulcers and hemorrhage in the gastric mucosa, usually caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acute stress, which can be asymptomatic or heavier to the digestive tract in clinical practice. pathological changes are characterized by gastric mucosal erosion and bleeding.acute mucosal erosion lesions are mainly called acute erosive gastritis; mucosal hemorrhage changes can be called acute hemorrhagic gastritis, which occurs in stress state, and multiple ulcers can be called stress ulcers.this disease is one of the common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, accounting for about 20-30%.","1. pay attention to diet, eat clean and digestible food, quit smoking, alcohol, drugs that have a stimulating effect on the gastric mucosa, it is best to avoid taking it or taking it after meals.for patients taking long-term non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, enteric-coated tablets should be taken after meals, and mucosal protective agents or small doses of h2 receptor antagonists should be added to eradicate helicobacter pylori. 2. actively deal with basic diseases and risk factors, eliminate pathogenic factors: anti-infection, anti-shock, correct hypoproteinemia, electrolyte and acid-base balance disorders, prevent and treat intracranial hypertension, protect heart, brain, kidney and other important organ functions.for those with a history of ulcers, a gastroscopy can be performed prior to major surgery to determine if the ulcer is combined.","i. exogenous factors some drugs such as non-sterol anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, etc., as well as adrenocortical hormones, certain antibiotics, alcohol, etc., can damage the mucosal barrier of the stomach. the mucosal permeability is increased, and the hydrogen ions of the gastric juice are oozing back into the gastric mucosa, causing erosion and bleeding of the gastric mucosa.adrenal cortical hormone can increase the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsin, decrease the secretion of gastric mucus, and slow down the renewal rate of gastric epithelial cells to cause this disease.non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also affect the gastric mucosal repair process by inhibiting local prostaglandin synthesis. second, endogenous factors include systemic infection, severe trauma, intracranial hypertension, severe burns, major surgery, shock, excessive stress and fatigue.under stress, the sympathetic nerve and the vagus nerve can be excited. the former causes the vasospasm of the gastric mucosa to contract, and the blood flow is reduced. the latter causes damage to the mucosal epithelium, and erosion and bleeding occur.severe shock can cause release of serotonin and histamine. the former stimulates the gastric wall cells to release lysosomes and directly damages the gastric mucosa. the latter increases the secretion of pepsin and gastric acid and impairs the gastric mucosal barrier.","['shock', 'abdominal discomfort', 'upper gastrointestinal bleeding', 'gastric mucosal congestion', 'disgusting']",['peritonitis'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']",['medical treatement']

environmental protection agency to kill c. difficile spores or a detergent containing 500p.pm chlorine in potentially contaminated areas. 11. there is no sufficient evidence for probiotics to prevent cdi.","(a) the cause of the disease pseudomembranous colitis is caused by the production of toxins by the two flora. 1. clostridium difficile is an important cause of pseudomembranous colitis associated with antibiotics. in 1935, elongated and strict anaerobic gram-positive was first isolated from infant feces by hall et al. bacillus, which is a resident bacteria in the intestines of normal people. in patients who are not treated with antibiotics, the number of clostridium difficiles accounts for only 2% to 3% of anaerobic bacteria. the toxins are few, and even do not produce toxins that cause disease to humans. the detection rate of clostridium difficile in the population is 5% to 13%. under normal circumstances, these bacteria are mutually restricted, cannot be multiplied, and will not cause disease. long-term use of a large number of antibiotics can inhibit the growth of various bacteria in the intestine, and the drug-resistant clostridium difficile, which is not affected by antibiotics, rapidly multiplies, and the clostridium difficile in stool can be as high as 10% of anaerobic bacteria. ~20%, a large amount of exotoxin is produced, causing mucosal necrosis, exudative inflammation with pseudomembrane formation, and this exotoxin can be found almost in the stool of all pseudomembranous colitis. clostridium difficile produces at least four substances, toxin a (enteric toxin), toxin b (cytotoxin), motility-influencing factor and a heat-sensitive toxin, wherein toxins a and b have been purified. toxin a has a molecular weight of 500,000 and toxin b has a molecular weight of 360,000. they are all composed of glycoproteins, sensitive to acids and bases, and resistant to ethers. the two toxins are mostly destroyed at 50 ～ c for 30 min. trypsin, chymotrypsin and cell protease are sensitive and are not decomposed by ribonuclease and dnase. at ph 4 or ph 10, the toxicity of toxin b disappears and the virulence of toxin a is not affected. toxin a can stimulate mucosal epithelial cells to increase the secretion of water and electrolytes, causing a large loss of water and electrolytes. toxin b can cause local allergic reactions to degeneration and necrosis of intestinal mucosa, and cellulose and mucin exudate to form pseudomembranes. oral injection into animals can cause enteritis and death. toxin a can stimulate intestinal mucosal epithelial cells to activate guanosine cyclase at low concentrations, resulting in an increase in intracellular g-phosphate guanosine. the role of toxin a and toxin b is synergistic, first toxin a causes intestinal tissue lesions, after which toxin b acts on these damaged tissue cells. both toxins are antigenic and can interact with the corresponding antibodies. toxin a antiserum cannot neutralize toxin b. while the anti-blood clearance of toxin b neutralizes toxin b, it can also neutralize part of toxin a. in addition, toxin b can be neutralized by clostridium solani anti-toxin. the third toxin motility factor is present in the filter sterilizing supernatant of clostridium difficile culture medium, which can change the electrical activity of rabbit ileum iliac muscle. the fourth toxin is low molecular weight protein, which is sensitive to heat. it is very unstable, and its action is the same as that of vibrio cholerae and escherichia coli, which can cause an increase in the secretion of ileal fluid in rabbits, but does not cause tissue damage. 2. coagulase-positive hemolytic drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus inhibits the intestinal tract including escherichia coli after using a large number of broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cephalosporin, etc.) the various flora, resistant staphylococcus aureus, multiply and produce exotoxin, leading to the occurrence of pseudomembranous colitis. gram staining of the stool smears of such patients can find piles of cocci, such as this the bacteria produced by the toxins can also be injected into animals. pseudomembranous colitis can also occur. it has been reported that 17% of staphylococcus aureus is detected in the stool of a group of admitted patients, and golden yellow grapes are found in the stool after 1 week of antibiotic treatment. the detection rate of cocci is 38% to 40%. it is also believed that in pseudomembranous colitis, staphylococcus aureus is only a concomitant bacterium is not a true pathogenic factor, and some people have not found golden yellow in tissue culture or stool culture of autopsy materials for pseudomembranous colitis. staphylococcus, it has also been reported that antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis patients have staphylococcus aureus and its toxins in the stool, but the aforementioned clostridium difficile and toxin are not seen, which shows that it has been proved difficult at present. clostridium difficile is an important cause of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, but not all pseudomembranous colitis is caused by clostridium difficile. under normal circumstances, the gastrointestinal tract is a balanced ecosystem. there are a large number of bacteria in the intestine. the bacteria and the number of these bacteria are basically constant. these bacteria help the bacteria itself and the antibodies it produces. infection, once certain factors cause the system to lose its ecological balance, it will cause disease, and the proportion of antibiotics most likely to produce flora is imbalanced. therefore, it is one of the important causes of pseudomembranous colitis. in theory, any antibiotic can cause this disease. . the most common are broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially lincomycin, ampicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and third-generation cephalosporins, which inhibit the normal flora of the intestines and make it difficult to distinguish bacillus bacterium develops rapidly and produces toxins that cause disease. this case also occurred after surgery, especially after gastrointestinal cancer surgery, as well as other serious diseases such as intestinal obstruction, malignant tumor, uremia, diabetes, heart failure, sepsis, kidney transplant patients treated with tacrolimus, etc. patient. these cases generally have extremely low disease resistance and immunity, or are treated with antibiotics due to the needs of the disease. the environment in the body changes, and the intestinal flora is dysfunctional, which is conducive to the proliferation of clostridium difficile. (2) pathogenesis 1. pathogenesis the bacteria in the intestine come from the oral cavity. the bacteria that enter the digestive tract from the outside are mostly killed by gastric acid when passing through the stomach. only a small number of unkilled bacteria enter the duodenum and in the upper part of the ileum, the surviving bacteria in the duodenum and jejunum are mainly gram-positive streptococci, lactobacillus, mycobacterium and yeast, the total number is less than 105/ml, and the number of bacteria in the lower and middle ileum begins to increase. it is 105-106/ml, and the main part of the ileum is aerobic escherichia. after the intestinal contents enter the large intestine, the bacteria are neutral or weakly alkaline in the anoxic environment, and the contents move slowly. under the conditions of large-scale reproduction, the main one is the anaerobic opportunistic flora, the number of anaerobic bacteria can be as much as 1011 per ml of colon content, the normal human intestinal tract is mainly obligate anaerobic bacteria, facultative needs oxygen bacteria only account for 1%. the normal flora in the digestive tract is regularly distributed according to the colonization of bacteria, excreted and excreted while living, and remains unchanged for life. the results of the study on the fecal flora of healthy people in china are similar to those reported in foreign countries, suggesting that the intestinal flora is anaerobic bacteria mainly, the average order of 9 common bacteria are: bacteroides, bifidobacterium, true bacillus, enterobacter, lactobacillus, enterococcus, clostridium, staphylococcus, yeast, bacteria in normal human intestinal tract the division cycle is 6 to 48 hours. in addition to the important role of gastric acid in maintaining the number of bacteria in the jejunum, the gastric and jejunal mucosa also have an intrinsic ph-independent inhibition characteristic. in the stomach and small intestine of patients with gastric acid deficiency or partial gastrectomy, a significant increase in the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was observed, and escherichia coli and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were present in the proximal small intestine, and the number of streptococcus, lactobacilli and fungi also increased. the normal flora promotes the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the body and participates in the absorption and metabolism of cholesterol, steroids, fats, proteins, lipids, amino acids and certain drugs in the body. the intestinal flora plays a non-specific immune role through the following mechanisms: 1h2o2 action; 2 bacterial toxin action; 3 space-occupying protection; 4 organic acid action; 5 competition for nutrition, normal flora can also produce multiple antigenic substances stimulates the body's immune response, keeps the immune system active and protects against multiple infections. the intestinal flora is disordered. if the amount of bacteria is reduced, it will cause lymphatic tissue dysplasia, lymphocyte proliferation, bloody cell loss, gamma globulin content, etc. the weakening of lymphokine secretion will also affect the cellular immune response, the establishment of delayed type allergic reaction, one of the main physiological functions of escherichia coli is its immunogenicity, e. coli can produce trace amounts of toxins like other normal flora, as an immunogen causes an immune effect on toxins. the composition of the intestinal flora is affected by physiological factors such as intestinal peristalsis, digestive tract ph, intestinal endocrine enzymes, mucus, antibody secretion and function, which vary with intestinal bacterial interactions, food, drugs, climate, and age. . normal intestinal peristalsis is the main defense mechanism to prevent bacteria from overgrowing in the small intestine. the small intestine relies on strong creep to make the bacteria in the intestinal cavity far less than the colon. when the intestinal peristalsis is reduced, the small intestine bacteria will grow densely, and the stomach acid will kill the upper small intestine. bacteria make the flora of this part rare, once the stomach acid is reduced, the amount of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria entering the stomach and small intestine will increase significantly, and e. coli and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria appear in the proximal small intestine, while fungi and the number of streptococcus has also increased accordingly. under normal circumstances, the bacteria in the human intestine are interdependent and mutually restrict to form a natural ecological balance between bacteria and human body. the bacteria present in the intestine are basically balanced in the species and quantity, and the content per gram in the large intestine the number of bacteria in the body is 1010~1011, and the small intestine also contains 108. under normal ecological balance, these bacteria resist the pathogenic bacteria by the bacteria and the bacteria to produce the antibodies produced by the human body. the bacteria do not constitute humans. harmful and can also synthesize certain vitamins, a large number of antibiotics, especially oral administration to change the balance between intestinal bacteria, dysbacteriosis of intestinal bacteria, non-pathogenic intestinal bacteria, such as the large intestine bacillus and other bacteria are killed by antibiotics, and bacteria with relatively strong resistance, such as staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, some bacillus capsulatus and fungi, rapidly grow and secrete, secrete exotoxin to cause intestinal lesions. the immune function and disease resistance of the patient's body decline or some diseases lead to intestinal ischemia, congestion, etc. can cause intestinal flora imbalance health pseudomembranous colitis. the occurrence of pseudomembranous colitis requires a disorder of the intestinal flora, endogenous or exogenous refractory clostridium or staphylococcus aureus, and the above-mentioned bacteria produce toxins and susceptible organisms. in infants and young children, clostridium difficile is one of the normal intestinal flora. because the toxin receptors on the intestinal mucosa of newborns and infants may not be mature, it will not cause disease. it is difficult for infants in the intestines less than 1 month old. clostridium difficile can account for more than 50% of the total bacteria, 30% to 90% of infants within 1 year of age carry the bacteria in the intestines, and then gradually decrease with age, accounting for the intestinal tract in adulthood 3% of bacteria. after the patient uses antibiotics, the intestinal flora is killed or inhibited, resulting in disorder of the normal flora. although the clostridium difficile is also largely eliminated, it is easy to multiply if the antagonistic bacteria are reduced. the patient was not carriers before receiving antibiotics. after receiving antibiotics, the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the intestines were removed, and the intestinal colonization resistance decreased, resulting in the bacterial receptors on the intestinal mucosal cells originally occupied by these bacteria. clostridium difficile from the outside adhered to settle. in addition to the use of antibiotics, other diseases not treated with antibiotics, such as partial gastrectomy or vagus nerve ablation plus pyoplasty, gastrectomy, gastrojejunostomy, duodenum or jejunum diverticulum, surgical blindnessy (end side anastomosis), intestinal obstruction (stenosis, adhesion, inflammation, cancer) intestinal short circuit and sputum, low stomach acid and associated with motor dysfunction, intestinal fistula, ileocecal resection, etc. can cause gastrointestinal changes in motor function, combined with changes in the environment of the intestine, such as ileocecal resection, loss of ileocecal valve plays an important role in regulating the normal distribution of intestinal flora, can not prevent the colonic flora from flowing back into the small intestine, weakening the intestinal tract others such as leukemia, malignant tumors or receiving radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and infection, chronic wasting diseases can also change the ecological balance of the normal intestinal flora, and the feces may be separated. clostridium difficile-producing strains, pseudomembranous colitis. 2. histopathological studies have shown that typical pseudomembranous colitis has a histologically specific laminar pathological changes, no vasculitis, early lesions, normal mucosa between lesions and lesions, complete necrosis of advanced mucosa a small number of glands survive, covered with a thick layer of inflammatory cells, mucin and cellulose, edema and inflammation continue to develop, extending to the submucosa or even beyond the submucosa is not easily distinguished from other intestinal inflammation. about 60% of the lesions occur in the small intestine, 15% occur in the large intestine, and 25% in the large intestine. the pathological changes are mainly confined to the mucosa and submucosa. the affected intestines may have staged distribution of mucosal necrosis, pseudomembrane formation, and mucosal lesions. it is characterized by congestion and edema, and localized necrotic lesions can fuse with each other. (1) gross morphology: the intestinal lumen of pseudomembranous colitis is visible to the naked eye, and a large amount of thick mucus accumulates. the mucosa is covered with spots or patches of yellowish white, yellow, brown or yellow scattered from several millimeters to several centimeters. the green pseudomembrane is severely fused into a piece to completely cover the entire intestine segment with a pseudomembrane. the pseudomembrane is formed by the solidification of cellulose, neutrophils, monocytes, mucin, bacteria and necrotic cells, and the pseudomembranous texture is soft. it is brittle, easy to separate from the mucous membrane, floats in the intestinal fluid and excretes with the stool. after the pseudomembrane falls off, the submucosa is exposed to form an ulcer, the serosa is congested, edematous, thickened, even necrotic and perforated. (2) histomorphology: under the microscope, the mucosa of the lesion is congested, and the mucous gland tube contains a lot of thick mucus. after the mucus is discharged, it participates in the composition of the pseudomembrane. when the lesion is heavy, the villi and the top of the mucosa have different degrees of necrosis or disappearance. in the lamina propria, there are neutrophils, plasma cells and lymphocytes infiltrating, glandular rupture and necrosis, submucosal telangiectasia, congestion and thrombosis, and vascular wall necrosis can lead to mucosal ischemic necrosis. the lesions are generally limited to the mucosal layer. but it can also extend to the submucosal layer involving the whole layer, and even lead to large pieces of necrosis, generally can be divided into mild, severe, severe type 3 according to the degree of disease: 1 mild lesions: the initial damage is acute inflammatory in the lamina propria of the mucosa cells, eosinophil infiltration and cellulose exudation form focal necrosis, and fibrinogen and polymorphonuclear cells in necrotic lesions aggregate to form a special apical lesion. 2 severe lesions: the lesion did not invade the submucosa, the mucosal glands were destroyed, the pseudomembrane formed, the destruction of acute inflammatory cells containing mucin and the gland was covered by a typical pseudomembrane, the lamina propria neutral polymorphonuclear cells infiltration, accompanied by typical volcanic ridge-like necrotic lesions. 3 severe lesions: the mucosa is completely destroyed, the deep layer of the lamina propria is violated, and the lamina propria is covered by a thick and intertwined pseudomembrane. after the lesion healed, the pseudomembrane fell off, and the wound healing under the pseudomembrane became red. after 10 days after the pseudomembrane fell off, the endoscopy could completely return to normal.","['shock', 'intestinal', 'face pale', 'intestinal perforation', 'diarrhea', 'abdominal pain', 'clothing snow source', 'tachycardia', 'mixed acid-base balance disorder', ' toxic megacolon ', 'peritonitis']","['intestinal obstruction', 'toxic shock syndrome']","['surgery', 'general surgery']","['early stop related antibiotics, antibiotic treatment, fecal flora transplantation treatment, surgical treatment']"

(4) it has been reported that adrenocortical hormone is effective for fatty liver and active alcoholic hepatitis, but there are reports that the effect is not certain. (4) the propylthiouracil has been tried and the effect cannot be determined.","there are many factors affecting the progression or aggravation of alcoholic liver injury. the risk factors that have been found in domestic and international research include: alcohol consumption, drinking years, alcoholic beverages, drinking patterns, gender, race, obesity, hepatitis virus infection, genetic factors. , nutritional status, etc. according to epidemiological survey data, liver damage caused by alcohol has a threshold effect, that is, reaching a certain amount of alcohol consumption or drinking years, it will greatly increase the risk of liver damage. however, due to the large individual differences, studies have shown that the dose-response relationship between drinking and liver damage is not very clear. there are many varieties of alcoholic beverages, and the damage caused by different alcoholic beverages to the liver is also different. alcoholic drinking is also a risk factor for alcoholic liver injury. fasting drinking is more likely to cause liver damage than drinking with meals. women are more sensitive to alcohol-mediated hepatotoxicity, and heavier alcoholic liver disease may occur in smaller doses and shorter drinking periods than men. drinking the same amount of alcoholic beverages, the levels of alcohol in the blood of men and women are significantly different. the allele frequency and genotype distribution of alcohol-induced liver disease susceptibility genes alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) 2, adh3 and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) 2 in the han population are different from those in western countries, and may be chinese alcoholics and one of the reasons for the incidence of alcoholic liver disease is lower than in western countries. not all drinkers have alcoholic liver disease, but only in a small group of people, indicating that there are individual differences between groups in the same region. the rise in the mortality rate of alcoholic liver disease is related to the degree of malnutrition. the lack of vitamin a or the decrease in vitamin e levels may also aggravate liver damage. diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids can contribute to the progression of alcoholic liver disease, while saturated fatty acids protect against alcoholic liver disease. obesity or overweight can increase the risk of progression to alcoholic liver disease. hepatitis virus infection and alcohol have a synergistic effect on liver damage. drinking alcohol based on hepatitis virus infection or hbv or hcv infection based on alcoholic liver disease can accelerate the occurrence and development of liver disease. the pathogenesis has proven the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver in recent years: 1. free fatty acid enters the blood too much. 2. the new synthesis of fatty acids in the liver increases. 3. oxidation of fatty acids in the liver is reduced. 4. triacylglycerol is too synthetic. 5, lipoprotein release disorders in liver cells. it is currently believed that the direct toxic effect of alcohol on hepatocytes is the main cause of fatty liver. the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis has been shown to be involved in immune factors in recent years, and it is of great significance. it is currently believed that swollen hepatocytes cannot discharge filaments and accumulate in hepatocytes to form alcoholic transparent bodies and cause transparent bodies. the production of antibodies, self-hepatic antigens and isolated alcoholic transparent bodies, can stimulate lymphocyte transformation and migration-moving inhibitory factor (mif) activity in patients. alcoholic cirrhosis can detect autoimmune characteristics of natural dna antibodies, and liver cell membranes produce igg and iga antibodies, which can be adsorbed by liver infusion. in recent years, it has been proved that alcohol and acetaldehyde can change liver cell membrane antigen, and it is not directly affected by the toxicity of acetaldehyde on the liver cell membrane.","['hepatic lesions diffuse', 'upper abdominal discomfort', 'alcoholic cirrhosis', 'hepatic congestion', 'liver palm', 'nail is fan-shaped', 'tongue inflammation', 'spider', 'thickness', 'testicular atrophy']",['neuritis'],['hepatopathy'],"['alcohol treatment, medication, ', 'supportive treatment']"
hepatitis a,"hepatitis a is an acute liver inflammation caused by infection with hepatitis a virus (hav). it is mainly transmitted through the fecal-oral route. it is common in children and adolescents. it is one of the common intestinal infectious diseases in china. the incidence and infection rate of hepatitis is the highest.the source of hepatitis a infection is usually acute patients and latent infections, and the number of the latter is much higher than the former.the patient can be contagious to the peak of serum alanine aminotransferase (alt) one week before the onset of the disease, and can be extended to 30 days after the onset of the disease. the fecal-oral route is the main route of transmission, and daily contact is the main spread of sporadic cases. way.","(1) manage patients with early detection ofinfectious diseasesand isolate them. the isolation period is 3 weeks from the date of onset. after isolation, the patients are disinfected in their living quarters and activities. after the childcare institution finds hepatitis a, it is close. the contact was medically observed for 45 days. (2) cut off the transmission route to strengthen water source, diet, manure management, especially to manage the feces of patients with hepatitis a, to control the epidemic of hepatitis a, disinfect the shared tableware and drinking utensils, implement a meal-sharing system, and develop a meal before meals. good habit of washing your hands afterwards. (3) protecting susceptible populations for those who are susceptible to contact with hepatitis a, vaccination with human gamma globulin or human placental gamma globulin may be used. the dosage is 0.02-0.05 ml/kg, preferably by injection. within 2 weeks after exposure, the fundamental measure to prevent the spread of hepatitis a is extensive vaccination, domestic application of human embryo lung diploid cell culture, continuous low-temperature passage, and hav h2 and la-1 attenuated vaccine strains, and it has been developed into a live attenuated vaccine. the preliminary application proves that safety can induce specific antibody production, but the yield is limited and the cost is high. the foreign hav inactivated vaccine has been approved for wide application, and domestic inactivated vaccines and recombinant vaccines have been studied. the development of genetic engineering hepatitis a vaccine is the future development direction. 1, passive immunization: hepatitis a immunoglobulin. 2. active immunization: hepatitis a vaccine. live attenuated hepatitis a vaccine (this type of vaccine is only used in china). hepatitis a inactivated vaccine (this type of vaccine is widely used in countries all over the world and is internationally recognized).","hepatitis a is more common in children in the endemic areas after 6 months of age. as the age increases, the susceptibility gradually declines, so hepatitis a is less common in adults.it has been reported that hepatitis a can also be transmitted through blood and vertically (foreign medical dissemination, 1994), and further research is needed. hepatitis a takes the faecal-oral route as the main route of transmission, and the way of faecal-oral transmission is diverse. under normal circumstances, contact with daily life is the main mode of transmission of sporadic morbidity, so in collective units such as child care institutions, schools and troops. the incidence of hepatitis a is high. people who are not injected with hepatitis a vaccine are generally susceptible to hav, and people who have hepatitis a or have been infected with hepatitis a virus can obtain long-lasting immunity. the spread of water and food, especially aquatic shellfish such as edulis, is the main mode of transmission of hepatitis a outbreaks.","['big hepatocyte necrosis', 'total bilirubin high', 'appetite loss', 'appetite loss', 'abdominal pain', 'liver qi stagnation', 'transpeptidase high', 'fear cold' , 'respiratory heart', 'disgusting']",['hepatocarcinoma'],['hepatopathy'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
acute gastroenteritis,"acute gastroenteritis is an acute inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. the clinical manifestations are mainly nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever.the disease is common in summer and autumn, and it occurs mostly due to improper diet, overeating or eating cold and rot, turbid and unclean food.according to the difference in etiology and constitution, chinese medicine divides gastroenteritis into different types such as damp heat, cold dampness and stagnation.","1. pay attention to hygiene: keep food, utensils, containers, refrigerators and other food preservation places and the environment clean. 2, do not eat unclean food: when the food rots and deteriorates, must not eat.it is best not to wait overnight for meals, etc., and the fruits and vegetables must be cleaned before eating. 3, to avoid irritation: diet should be light, try to avoid irritating foods, such as pepper, coffee, tea and so on.at the same time, it is necessary to avoid the stimulation of drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can seriously stimulate our gastrointestinal mucosa. 4, strengthen exercise, pay attention to keep warm: summer and autumn season weather changes seriously, we must increase or decrease clothing in a timely manner, especially after entering the fall, we must pay attention to keep warm, cover the quilt at rest.strengthen physical exercise and improve the body's immunity.","salmonella and halophilic bacteria (vibrio parahaemolyticus) are often the most common infections. toxins are common in staphylococcus aureus, and viruses are also visible.there are often cases of collective morbidity or frequent family.if you eat contaminated poultry, livestock meat, fish, or eat seafood such as crabs and snails that grow halophilic bacteria, and eat leftovers, leftovers, etc. contaminated with staphylococcus aureus, the disease is induced. eating cold food or certain drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, certain antibiotics, etc.; or accidentally taking strong acids, alkalis and pesticides can cause the disease.","['stool does not form', 'nausea and vomiting', 'increase in intestinal absorption,' 'fever', 'diarrhea', 'dark yellow or green...', 'abdominal pain', 'diarrhea is watery zone sticky...', 'disgusting', 'children's front depression']",['dehydration'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment such as protection of gastrointestinal mucosa, antacids, antibiotics, fluid replacement, etc.']"
colon polyps,"it is a kind of bulging lesion that protrudes from the mucosal surface into the intestinal lumen of the colon. it is called colon polyps before the pathological properties are determined. according to the pathology, adenomatous polyps (including papillary adenomas) are most common. inflammatory polyps, the result of long-term inflammation-stimulated hyperplasia of the intestinal mucosa, hamartoma-type polyps, other, such as hypertrophic hyperplasia of hyperplasia, lymphoid tissue hyperplasia, carcinoid and other diseases.","1. aspirin prevents female colon polyps: some women have a common genetic variation that can slow down the breakdown of aspirin. these women can reduce the risk of colon polyps if they insist on taking aspirin. in contrast, in women who do not have this genetic variant, aspirin does not reduce the risk of colon polyps. 2, calcium supplementation helps prevent colon polyps: calcium can help humans fight colon polyps and colon cancer, even if patients have had these diseases before. studies have shown that those who take calcium tablets every day have a 19-34% reduction in the risk of recurrence of colon polyps. calcium-rich foods include milk and other dairy products, as well as broccoli. in addition, vitamin d (which helps the body's absorption of calcium) also shows a reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer. you can get enough vitamin d by properly ingesting some animal liver, egg yolk, fish and dairy products with vitamin d. sunlight also converts a chemical component of the skin into available vitamin d. if you don't drink milk or sun, you may want to consider taking a ""vitamin d + calcium"" compound supplement. 3. fruits, vegetables and whole grains help prevent colon polyps: these foods are rich in fiber and can reduce the risk of colon polyps. in addition, fruits and vegetables are also rich in antioxidants that can prevent colon cancer. 4, no smoking, drinking can prevent colon polyps: smoking, excessive drinking will increase the risk of colon polyps and colon cancer. women should not drink more than 150 ml of wine per day, or 360 ml of beer, or 40 ml of white wine, while men should not exceed twice as many as women. if you have a family history of colon cancer, you should especially reduce smoking and drinking to reduce the risk. 5, adhere to physical exercise, maintain a healthy weight: weight control can independently reduce the risk of colon disease. it is recommended to exercise at least 30 minutes each time, five times a week. if you have 45 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every day, it will work better in reducing the risk of bowel cancer. 6, have a good attitude to deal with stress, work and rest, do not fatigue. visible pressure is an important cause of cancer. chinese medicine believes that stress leads to excessive physical weakness, which leads to decreased immune function, endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders in the body, leading to the deposition of acidic substances in the body. stress can also lead to mental stress causing qi stagnation and blood stasis. invagination and so on. 7, do not eat contaminated food, such as contaminated water, crops, poultry, eggs, moldy food, etc., to eat some green organic food, to prevent disease from mouth.","so far, the cause of colon polyps is unclear.some may be associated with long-term inflammatory stimuli or heredity. the occurrence of colon polyps is related to many factors: 1. long-term diarrhea, many patients with intestinal mucosa are susceptible to allergies, such as drinking alcohol, eating chili or greasy food or seafood after diarrhea, some patients will have diarrhea without cause, thus, intestinal mucosa chronic inflammation can occur, which can lead to the growth of intestinal polyps. 2, long-term constipation, constipation patients often have a bowel movement once a day, feces long-term storage in the intestine will produce a variety of toxins, resulting in chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, easy to grow polyps. 3. genetics, such as familial polyposis, is a genetic disease. 4, inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease and other diseases are prone to polyps. the occurrence of colon polyps may be related to the following factors: the living habits (20%): the incidence of fibrous polyps in food is less, and vice versa, smoking is also closely related to adenomatous polyps, smoking history small adenomas occur within 20 years, and those with a history of smoking for more than 20 years are associated with large adenomas. genetics (20%): the occurrence of certain multiple polyps is genetically related. the patient inherits the defective apc allele from the parental germ cells, while another apc allele in the colonic epithelium is born. the time is normal. later, when the allele is mutated, an adenoma occurs at the mutation site. this mutation is called a somatic mutation. infection (10%): it has been reported that the occurrence of adenomatous polyps is associated with viral infection. age (10%): the incidence of colon polyps increases with age. embryo abnormalities (5%): juvenile polyposis is mostly hamartoma, which may be related to abnormal embryonic development.","['about the frequency of defecation', 'exhaust obstacle', 'emergency after heavy', 'blood blood', 'mucus stool', 'abdominal

acute appendicitis,"acute appendicitis is commonly known as ""cebiitis"", which is a misunderstanding on the anatomy. the actual appendix is an organ at the end of the cecum.if there is a fecal stone obstruction, lymphatic hyperplasia or parasitic invasion in the appendix, it is prone to inflammation of the appendix and cause disease.according to the severity of the disease, the disease can be divided into: acute, subacute, chronic, and can cause complications such as abscess, gangrene and perforation leading to peritonitis.general diagnosis and treatment is not difficult and is good afterwards.but because the end of the appendix can be located almost anywhere on the abdomen.therefore, the signs may vary greatly.therefore, it must be carefully identified with other acute abdomen to avoid misdiagnosis.","do not rush after the meal, summer heat should not be too cold, especially should not drink cold beer, and other cold drinks, usually pay attention not to be too fatty, avoid excessive irritating, should actively participate in physical exercise, enhance physical fitness, improve immunity if you have a history of chronic appendicitis, you should pay attention to avoid recurrence, and usually keep the stool smooth. 1. enhance physical fitness and pay attention to hygiene. 2, be careful not to suffer from cold and diet. 3, timely treatment of constipation and intestinal parasites.","the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis is not yet certain, but most of the opinions suggest that several factors occur in combination. among them, the recognized factors are as follows: the appendix is an elongated tube, and only one end is connected to the cecum. once obstructed, the lumen can be made. endocrine accumulation, internal pressure increased, oppression of the appendix wall obstructs the distal blood supply. on this basis, bacteria in the lumen invade the damaged mucosa, which is prone to infection. some people have found that gangrenous appendicitis has obstruction. the common cause of obstruction is :1 blocked the waste stone in the appendix cavity, dried fecal mass, food debris, foreign matter, aphids, etc.; 2 the wall of the appendix was destroyed and caused the lumen to narrow or adhere; 3 the appendix formed by the short tibial membrane was twisted and obstructed the tube is unobstructed; 4 the lymphatic tissue hyperplasia or edema in the wall of the appendix causes the lumen to become narrow; 5 the opening of the appendix is in the vicinity of the cecum, such as inflammation, polyps, tuberculosis, tumors, etc., so that the opening of the appendix is compressed and the emptying is blocked. fecal stone obstruction is the most common, accounting for about 1/3. obstruction is a common basic factor in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis. therefore, the early stage of acute appendicitis often has xiphoid or umbilical colic, which is caused by obstruction of the appendix lumen and increased internal pressure. in addition, the specimens of the appendix are often seen. the fecal stone obstructs the lumen, and the distal end is obviously inflammatory and even gangrenous. there are also cases of obstruction and the main cause of the direct infection caused by bacteria in the appendix cavity. the appendix cavity is connected with the cecum, so it has the same strain and quantity of escherichia coli and anaerobic bacteria. if the appendix mucosa is slightly damaged, bacteria invade the wall, causing different degrees of infection. a small number of patients occur after the upper respiratory tract infection, so it is considered that the infection can be transmitted from the blood to the appendix, and some infections occur from the adjacent organs. sexual infection, invading the appendix. among other factors that are thought to be associated with the disease, visceral nerve reflexes due to gastrointestinal dysfunction (diarrhea, constipation, etc.) cause the appendix muscles and vasospasm. once the normal strength is exceeded, the appendix lumen stenosis and blood supply disorders may occur. impaired mucous membranes and acute inflammation caused by bacterial invasion. in addition, some people believe that the incidence of acute appendicitis is related to eating habits and heredity. the incidence of polycellular diet is low, which may be related to the rapid emptying of the colon and constipation, due to constipation. habitual application of laxatives may cause intestinal mucosal congestion, but also affect the appendix. some people believe that genetic factors are associated with congenital malformations of the appendix, excessive distortion, small lumens, long length, poor blood supply, etc. are prone to acute inflammation. conditions of. pathogenesis 1, pathological type the basic pathological changes of acute appendicitis are tube wall congestion and edema, a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue damage to varying degrees, so it is divided into three types: simple, suppurative and gangrenous, the three are usually inflammation the three different stages of development, but also may be due to different factors of the three different direct consequences, due to concurrent perforation, combined with limited or diffuse peritonitis, the pathology of acute appendicitis is more complex and variable. (1) simple appendicitis: slight inflammatory changes in the appendix, edema congestion is not serious; or serosal hyperemia, inflammatory cell infiltration in all layers of the appendix wall, with a thick mucosa, superficial small bleeding point or ulcers (figure 3), such appendicitis is an early mild infection, clinical symptoms and body reactions are also light, if it can be treated in time, can achieve inflammation absorption, infection subsides, the appendix can return to normal. (2) suppurative appendicitis: caused by early inflammation, or due to obstruction of the appendix, internal pressure is increased, distal blood supply is severely blocked, infection is formed and spreads rapidly, resulting in suppurative or even cellulitis within a few hours. sexual infection, swelling of the appendix is significant, the serosa surface is highly congested and there are more purulent exudates, some or all of which are covered by the omentum, a large number of inflammatory cells infiltrate in the wall of the appendix, and some have formed tiny abscesses. or has been occupied by a large number of tiny abscesses of different sizes, there are purulent secretions in the appendix cavity, and there are obvious cases of escherichia coli and anaerobic infection. suppurative appendicitis can cause localized peritonitis around the appendix, but also because perforation leads to diffuse peritonitis. the appendix of this appendicitis has different degrees of tissue destruction. even if it is conservatively restored, the scar of the appendix wall shrinks, which can narrow the lumen and cause repeated inflammation (figure 4). (3) gangrenous appendicitis: due to aggravation of suppurative infection of the appendix, or due to severe obstruction of the appendix lumen, the appendix blood supply is completely blocked in a short period of time and causes appendix gangrene, reaching the most serious degree of acute inflammation of the appendix, according to the part of the appendix was blocked, and the appendix showed partial or complete necrosis. the necrotic part was purple-black. the mucosa was almost completely eroded and shed. there was bloody pus in the appendix cavity. most of them had perforation and were covered by the omentum. there are limited pus accumulations or diffuse peritonitis. such appendicitis can occur in specific conditions, or it can occur after clinical misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. once it appears, there are not only serious local signs but also severe the overall reaction, such as toxic shock, can have fatal consequences, so some people with gangrenous and perforated appendicitis are called advanced appendicitis, which should be prevented as much as possible during the development of acute appendicitis. if the above three types of acute appendicitis are still limited to the appendix and do not involve the surrounding area, the infection has a lighter effect on the body, and the treatment is easy and the effect is good. however, when the inflammation of the appendix is serious, it involves the surrounding, especially the perforation, and the infection invades the abdominal cavity. the inflammation spreads locally from the appendix to some or all of the abdominal cavity, and the pathology is complicated, which also causes difficulty in handling. appendicitis with localized peritonitis refers to the spread of acute appendicitis to the surrounding abdominal cavity. it can occur in the early or no perforation of the appendix. it is only formed by the suppuration of the serosal exudate. the peritoneal inflammation often occurs due to the omentum or peripheral intestinal fistula is surrounded and limited. the localized peritonitis caused by accumulated purulent exudate can also be transformed into abscess around the appendix because it is not treated in time. localized peritonitis may be absorbed and disappeared. once abscess is formed, the amount of abscess is small. surgical drainage is required, and the abscess may be due to multiple pus, high internal pressure, diffuse peritoneal inflammation due to ulceration of the abscess wall; or formation of multiple abscesses in the abdominal cavity; or ulceration to nearby organs (intestine, bladder, vagina) forming internal hemorrhoids; or breaking the abdominal wall to form the sinus; or due to the increased fibrosis of the abscess wall, forming a localized inflammatory mass and mistaken for the tumor. perforation of the appendix complicated with diffuse peritonitis is the most serious pathological change in acute appendicitis. the inflammation of the appendix is severe and progresses rapidly. the local area is too late to have the omentum or intestinal adhesion adhesion protection. once perforated, the infection quickly spreads to the entire abdominal cavity, so it is common in gangrene appendicitis, when the infection involves all abdominal cavity, because of the large abdominal area and large amount of exudate, it quickly leads to insufficient blood volume of the patient, and the bacteria and toxins in the intraperitoneal infection are absorbed in large quantities, so that the patient is fully systemic in a short time. in sepsis and shock, it is often critical and the mortality rate is high. acute appendicitis complicated with diffuse peritonitis is associated with perforation of appendix. perforation occurs in gangrenous appendicitis but can also occur in the late course of suppurative appendicitis. in the appendix or distal side of the appendix, there are 1000 cases of acute appendicitis. the perforation accounts for 21% and only 7% is complicated with diffuse peritonitis. the key is that the body has certain defense ability. the omentum, the nearby mesentery and the small intestine can be quickly adhere to the perforation to limit it, only when the patient lacks this ability, the perforation of the appendix the spread of infection can spread to the whole abdomen, the omentum of infants is too short, the uterus during pregnancy hinders the decline of the greater omentum, the elderly and the patients with acquired immunodeficiency, lack of limited infection ability, are easy to cause diffuse peritonitis after perforation of the appendix, must pay attention to, acute appendicitis complicated with sepsis can also be seen in severe infection through the appendix vein into the portal vein to become purulent portal phlebitis or multiple liver abscess, although rare, but there is a very high case fatality rate. 2, the disease is transferred to the above different pathological types can be random body defense mechanism strength, treatment is timely, correct and have different transformations. (1) inflammation subsides: simple appendicitis before the mucosa has not formed ulcers, timely anti-inflammatory may cause inflammation to subside without leaving pathological changes. early suppurative appendicitis, if treated, even if the inflammation subsides, it will be scar healing, causing the appendix cavity it narrows, the wall thickens, the appendix is distorted, and it is easy to relapse. (2) localization of inflammation: suppuration or gangrene. after perforation, the appendix is covered by the omentum to form an abscess around the appendix, or adhere to an inflammatory mass. this is a kind of outcome in which inflammation is limited, such as less pus. can be completely absorbed. (3) inflammation spread: if the body's defense mechanism is poor, or it is not treated in time, the inflammation is aggravated and the appendix is suppurated, the gangrene perforation is even diffuse peritonitis, and purulent portal phlebitis.","['dream pain', 'gastrointestinal symptoms', 'ischemic necrosis of the appendix wall', 'lower abdominal pain', 'abdominal pain', 'ischemic congestion of the appendix', 'abdominal rigidity', 'nausea', 'lower abdominal pain ']",['sepsis'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

acute colonic pseudoobstructive syndrome,"acute colline pseudoobstruction syndrome is a group of syndromes with primary or secondary colonic dilatation and no obstructive lesions in the colon itself.often occurs in chronic illnesses and long-term bedridden patients, often in the ileocecal or right colon.mainly manifested as progressive abdominal distension gradually worsened, patients with slow development of the disease can have no abdominal symptoms.","in the clinical application of antibiotics, the types of antibiotics should be carefully selected (broad-spectrum antibiotics are several times higher than narrow-spectrum antibiotics and cause aac, even pmc) and dosage.avoid the abuse of antibiotics and pmc.","its possible pathogenesis: parasympathetic nerves from the 2,3,4 sacral segment (s2 -4) of the spinal cord are blocked, leaving the left colon flaccid without tension; the body suffers from stress and other stress, hormonal disorders in body fluids; poor tension and prolonged bed rest, intestinal peristalsis is weakened, due to the above reasons, intestinal fluid accumulation can not be advanced to the far side, resulting in increasing intestinal pressure, the intestinal lumen is also progressive expansion and secondary colonic pseudo-obstruction.","['disgusting', 'acute abdominal pain', 'abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting']",['septicemia'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
acute cholecystitis,"acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder caused by cystic duct obstruction and bacterial invasion, including simple cholecystitis, suppurative or gangrenous cholecystitis, 80% with gallstones, is one of the common acute abdomen.common causes of this disease include: 1. stones in the cystic duct incarceration caused by obstruction, gallbladder cholestasis, concentrated bile salts damage the gallbladder mucosa caused by inflammation.the cause of obstruction is a basic factor that causes acute cholecystitis. 2. bacterial infection. the common pathogens are escherichia coli, aerogen, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are mostly retrograde from the biliary tract.3. chemical stimulation: high concentrations of bile salts stimulate acute inflammation of the gallbladder mucosa.often occurs after trauma, or after some abdominal surgery unrelated to the biliary system. in recent years, with the changes in the eating habits of the chinese people and the aging, the incidence of gallstones in urban people has increased significantly. therefore, acute cholecystitis is more common in urban residents, the incidence rate of adults is higher, and the incidence rate of the elderly is higher. obesity the incidence of women is high, according to statistics female: male is 2:1. repeated episodes of acute symptoms of this disease can be converted to chronic cholecystitis.at present, the cure rate of surgical treatment of this disease is high.mild simple cholecystitis can be treated with drugs; for suppurative or gangrenous cholecystitis should be treated promptly to avoid complications.","to prevent acute cholecystitis, we must do the following: 1. regular meals, no overeating.pay attention to diet, food should be light, eat less greasy and fried, grilled food. 2, keep the stool smooth. 3, to change the sedentary lifestyle, more walking, more exercise. 4, to raise sex, long-term family is not jealous, people with a bad mood can cause or aggravate the disease, to be broad-minded, comfortable.","this is a pioneering and basic factor in causing acute cholecystitis. the causes can be roughly divided into two categories: mechanical obstruction: it is generally believed that more than 90% of patients with acute cholecystitis have stones embedded in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, resulting in bile retention; some authors believe that even if there is no stone in the gallbladder during surgery or autopsy, it can not prove that there is no stone in the early stage of the disease, and the stone may have been discharged to the common bile duct. in addition to stones, the connection between the cystic duct and the common bile duct may also be due to a small angle, the cystic duct itself is too tortuous, deformed, or abnormal blood vessels, peripheral inflammation adhesions, aphid drilling, and enlarged lymph node compression caused obstruction and bile retention. functional disorders studies have confirmed that biliary muscles, neurological disorders, and normal emptying of the gallbladder are blocked, causing temporary bile retention. when there is a lesion in the abdominal organs, such as stomach, duodenal ulcer, chronic appendicitis or periarteritis, the splanchnic nerve is transmitted to the cerebral cortex by pathological stimulation, causing dysfunction of the cortex, thereby causing the cystic duct reflexively. the sphincter and duodenal papillary sphincter dysfunction causes paralysis, resulting in retention of bile throughout the biliary system. long-term bile retention and concentration in the gallbladder can stimulate the gallbladder mucosa, causing inflammatory lesions, and bacterial infection can form acute cholecystitis. about 70% of bacteria causing acute cholecystitis are escherichia coli, others include klebsiella, clostridium, staphylococcus, salmonella typhi, paratyphoid, staphylococcus, and pneumococcal. about 50% of patients with acute cholecystitis have positive bile culture. the path of bacterial invasion is usually through bile or lymphatic vessels, and sometimes it can be retrogradely into the biliary tract or blood-borne dissemination through the intestine. in short, there are many paths for bacteria to reach the gallbladder. there are a few cases in the clinic that have no bile retention or bacterial infection for other reasons. mainly seen in trauma and pancreatic reflux. trauma, including surgery, burns, etc., can lead to acute cholecystitis. in the case of trauma, bile viscosity increases due to pain, fever, dehydration, emotional stress, etc., and emptying slows down. in addition, when the pancreatic and bile ducts are obstructed, trypsin in the reflux pancreatic juice is activated by bile, which binds to bile acids and also activates phospholipase to convert lecithin to lysolecithin, both of which act on the gallbladder wall. , causing damage.","['fever"", 'small fingernails have depression', 'abdominal pain', 'wall thickness of gallbladder', 'coronary gallbladder sign', 'sudden pain', 'nausea', 'biliary colic', 'right back pain ']","['bile peritonitis', 'liver abscess', 'cholelithiasis', 'hyponatremia', 'nutrition', 'diarrhea', 'hiccup', 'biliary bleeding', 'intestinal obstruction', 'yellow sputum' ]","['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
gilbert syndrome,"gilbert syndrome is also known as constitutional liver dysfunction, hereditary non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia.it is a congenital non-hemolytic indirect bilirubin-enhancing jaundice.more common in young men, may have a family history.mainly due to the uptake of bilirubin and bilirubin into the microsomes by hepatocytes, or the lack of glucuronyltransferase activity in hepatocytes, the indirect bilirubin in the blood is increased.the disease is more common in men and can occur in any person, but it is more common in 15-20 years old. the patient has no obvious symptoms and is generally in good condition.","various incentives should be avoided. when the jaundice appears, liver enzyme inducer, such as phenobarbital 60 mg, 3 times a day, orally, can be used to increase the activity of glucuronyltransferase in hepatocytes, thereby reducing the indirect bilirubin in the blood.","mainly due to the uptake of bilirubin by hepatocytes, and the dysfunction of bilirubin to microsomes, or the insufficient activity of glucuronyltransferase in hepatocytes, the indirect bilirubin in the blood is increased.","['indigestion', 'low', 'hemolytic jaundice']",['viral hepatitis'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
calculous cholecystitis,"calculous cholecystitis refers to acute or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder caused by long-term or intermittent stimulation of stones in the gallbladder or incarceration of the gallbladder neck.its clinical manifestation depends on the location and size of the stone, whether it causes infection, obstruction, and the location and extent of obstruction.calculous cholecystitis is the most common lesion in the biliary system.","1. universal prevention: the purpose of primary prevention is to prevent the formation of stones.dietary changes are associated with stone formation, the type of stone induced (cholesterol stones or bile pigment stones), and stone dissolution.the occurrence of stones has both genetic and environmental factors. the former is more difficult to change, while the latter can be adjusted.studies of risk factors for cholesterol gallstones have also confirmed this: high calorie and fat intake, increased incidence of cholelithiasis; and reduced incidence of stones due to low intake.based on epidemiological and stone-forming mechanisms, the following preventive measures are recommended. 1 prevention of cholesterol super-saturated bile: obese people have too much cholesterol in the body, bile discharge.on the other hand, obese patients use various methods to reduce weight and consume body fat tissue, in which cholesterol is discharged into bile and also increases bile cholesterol.therefore, avoiding obesity has positive significance. 2 increase calcium and cellulose intake: dca increases bile cholesterol secretion, inhibits bile acid synthesis rate-limiting enzyme activity, and induces nucleation to accelerate.ruijin hospital of shanghai second medical university analyzed more than 400 patients with gallstones and found that serum dca content was significantly greater than normal.foods high in calcium and cellulose can reduce dca and prevent gallstone formation. 3 reduce the intake of saturated fatty acids: animal experiments have shown that the reduction of saturated fatty acids in food can not only reduce the cholesterol content of bile, but also reduce the nucleation activity of bile. 4 regular meals and increased exercise: recently in the animal model with a mixture of lipids and proteins or exogenous cholecystokinin (cck) to stimulate gallbladder emptying, prevent bile stasis, significantly reduced gallstones.it is recommended to eat on time to avoid excessive interval between the two meals and reduce the blocking time of bile acid enterohepatic circulation.when the liver secretes bile acids, the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in the bile bubbles decreases.it is recommended to add a small meal before going to sleep after three meals, shortening the fasting time of one night.frequent emptying of the gallbladder not only promotes the circulation of bile acids, but also reduces the residence time of bile in the gallbladder.this type of diet may increase the intake of calories and pose a risk of obesity, so it is necessary to increase physical activity and promote energy expenditure. 2. prevention of high-risk groups: in addition to primary prevention for the general population, it is also necessary to selectively prevent some high-risk groups who are about to form stones.high-risk people with stones refer to people with risk factors for the formation of gallstones.epidemiology points out that age, women, women, people with indian genetics, and hyperlipidemia are all risk factors.","clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is an important risk factor for the incidence of cholesterol gallstones in the gallbladder, and the incidence of obese people is three times that of normal weight. the reason why obese people are more susceptible to disease is that the amount of cholesterol synthesis in the body is absolutely increased, or the relative increase in bile acids and phospholipids makes the cholesterol supersaturated. epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence increases with age. the disease is rare in childhood and may be associated with hemolysis or congenital biliary disease. the 5-year incidence rate of 40-69 years old is 4 times that of the low-age group, and the boundary between high-incidence and low-incidence is 40 years old. although there are some differences in reports from various countries, the peak age of onset is 40-50 years old. one age group. the results of ultrasound diagnosis are about 1:2. the difference in sex ratio is mainly reflected in the incidence of cholesterol stones. there is no significant gender difference in the incidence of gallstones in the gallbladder. high levels of cholesterol in women may be associated with estrogen lowering bile flow, increasing cholesterol secretion in bile, lowering total bile acid volume and activity, and progesterone affecting gallbladder motility and causing bile stasis. pregnancy promotes the formation of stones and the number of pregnancies is positively correlated with morbidity. this view has been demonstrated by clinical and epidemiological studies. the causes of stones in pregnancyare:1 increased estrogen during pregnancy changes the bile composition, which increases the saturation of cholesterol in the bile. 2 the gallbladder emptying during pregnancy is slow, b-ultrasound shows that when the pregnant woman is fasting, the gallbladder volume increases, the residual volume increases after contraction, and the gallbladder contraction rate decreases. 3 changes in body weight during pregnancy and postpartum also affect bile composition, change the intestinal liver circulation of bile acids, and promote the formation of cholesterol crystals. there are some differences in the incidence rates in different countries and regions. the prevalence of calculus in western europe, north america and australia is high, and cholelithiasis is rare in many parts of africa. the types of gallstones vary from country to country, with cholesterol stones in sweden and germany, and calcium carbonate stones in the uk. eating habits are the main factors affecting the formation of gallstones. the incidence of refined foods and high-cholesterol foods is significantly higher. because refined carbohydrates increase bile cholesterol saturation. the differences in the incidence of calculous cholecystitis also suggest that genetic factors are one of the pathogenesis.the incidence of gallstones is high in people with indian genes.studies on single-oval twins have shown that the risk of gallstones in the relatives of the patients is also high, and the incidence rate in the family of calculous cholecystitis is also advanced, so it has a genetic predisposition. the incidence of calculous cholecystitis is also associated with cirrhosis, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, parenteral nutrition, surgical trauma, and the use of certain drugs.for example, the incidence of cirrhosis patients is three times that of no cirrhosis, and the incidence of diabetes patients is twice that of non-diabetic patients.the causes of the formation of cholecystitis are closely related to various factors such as lipid metabolism, nucleation time, gallbladder motor function, and bacterial gene fragments.","['extrahepatic bile duct stones', 'cholesterol volume reduction', 'bilirubin calcium stones', 'sustained pain', 'coronary

acute pancreatitis,"acute pancreatitis (ap) is a common acute abdomen, and its incidence accounts for the third to fifth places of acute abdomen.more than 80% of the patients have milder conditions, that is, acute edematous pancreatitis, which can be cured by non-surgery, which is basically a medical disease.about 10% of patients belong to severe pancreatitis, that is, acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis. the inflammation of the pancreas is irreversible or self-limiting. it is often treated with surgery and should be regarded as a surgical disease.due to the deeper understanding of acute pancreatitis, diagnostic techniques and treatment methods have been greatly developed, and it has become a problem of great interest to internal and external surgeons. at the same time, the mortality rate of severe pancreatitis remains high, reaching 30%. ~60%, and prone to various serious complications, is still a serious challenge for doctors.","acute pancreatitis has a recurring trend. preventive measures include removing the cause and avoiding incentives, such as abstinence, overeating, and treatment of hyperlipidemia. cholelithiasis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, so it is acute. patients with cholelithiasis with a history of pancreatitis should undergo elective cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration.","bile reflux occurs due to biliary mites, incomplete ampullary calculi, and narrowing of the duodenal papilla.if the lower end of the bile duct is obviously obstructed, the pressure in the biliary tract is very high, and the high-pressure bile refluxes the pancreatic duct, causing the pancreatic acinus to rupture, and the pancreatic enzyme enters the pancreatic interstitial and pancreatitis occurs. long-term drinkers are prone to pancreatitis. on this basis, when a large amount of alcohol and binge eating is used, the secretion of pancreatic enzyme is promoted, causing the pressure in the pancreas to rise suddenly, causing the pancreatic vesicle to rupture and the pancreatic enzyme to enter between the acinus. the interstitial causes acute pancreatitis.the simultaneous intake of alcohol and high-protein and high-fat foods not only increases the secretion of pancreatic enzymes, but also causes hyperlipoproteinemia.at this time, pancreatic lipase decomposes triglyceride to release free fatty acids and damage the pancreas. pancreatic small arteries, acute embolism, obstruction, acute pancreatitis caused by pancreatic acute blood circulation disorder; another factor is based on pancreatic duct obstruction, when pancreatic duct obstruction, pancreatic duct hypertension, passive pancreatic enzyme sexual ""infiltration"" interstitial.as a result of pancreatic enzyme stimulation, lymphatic vessels, veins, and arterial embolism in the stroma are caused, followed by ischemic necrosis of the pancreas. pancreatic trauma causes pancreatic duct rupture, pancreatic fluid spillover, and insufficient blood supply after trauma, resulting in acute severe pancreatitis. acute pancreatitis can cause various bacterial infections and viral infections. viruses or bacteria enter the pancreatic tissue through blood or lymph, causing pancreatitis.under normal circumstances, this infection is simple edematous pancreatitis, and there are fewer patients with hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis.","['abdominal tenderness', 'fading around the umbilical', 'inflammation', 'vomiting', 'peritoneal irritation', 'abdominal pain', 'fecal vomit', 'nausea', 'unique cell enzyme activity']","['pancreas abscess', 'pancreatic pseudocyst', 'shock', 'hematuria', 'gastrointestinal bleeding', 'diffuse intravascular coagulation', 'consciousness disorder', 'coma', 'septicemia', 'chronic pancreatitis']","['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['drug comprehensive treatment such as fluid replacement, enzyme inhibition, acid suppression, anti-infection, nutritional support, etc., serious complications need surgery]"
colon injury,"injury of colon is a common cavity organ injury caused by blunt abdominal injury and penetrating injury. it can also be caused by iatrogenic injury such as barium enema or colonoscopy. perforation, etc.because there are more bacteria in the colon, the peritonitis is serious, the symptoms of systemic poisoning are heavier, and often life-threatening. some parts of the colon are extraperitoneal. when the injury occurs, the peritonitis is not easily missed. the abdominal injury is often multiple organs, multiple segments of intestinal damage, peritonitis. obviously, it is easy to cover up the colon damage caused by misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis, should pay attention.","no specific precautions, pay attention to avoid trauma.in the case of abdominal trauma, the colonic rectal injury is guarded, and early treatment is found early to prevent complications.","the cause of colon injury is divided into three aspects: blunt injury (20%): due to traffic accidents, earthquakes and collapse of the house, etc., when the abdominal closed injury, the force directly on the spine, can cause transverse colon fracture; or because the colon wall is thin , the tension is large, the squeezing of the intestine is ruptured; or the damage to the blood vessels involving the mesenteric membrane leads to colon necrosis and the like. iatrogenic injury (20%): sigmoidoscopy or fiberoptic colonoscopy, due to improper operation, causing colonic perforation rupture; or electrocautery polyps caused by colonic perforation rupture, double-pressure contrast angiography in barium enema or sputum when the intussusception is reset, the colon can be ruptured and perforated; colon damage can also be caused by surgical damage to the intestinal wall and mesangium. colonic injury usually accounts for 10% to 20% of abdominal injury, more wartime, more complications after colon injury surgery, and correspondingly higher mortality. in the case of colon injury, the lamella layer is ruptured, the sarcolemma ruptures and the whole layer of the intestinal wall is ruptured or even broken; the contusion of the intestinal wall has a subserosal hematoma and a hematoma in the intestinal wall; if the mesangial is damaged, there is an arteriovenous rupture, or vascular thrombosis causes delayed intestinal necrosis. when the colon wall is completely ruptured or necrotic and perforated, the colon contents (feces) overflow into the abdominal cavity, diffuse peritonitis occurs, and if there is adhesion, localized peritonitis can be formed, occasionally due to small perforation, and fecal slag is blocked and healed, colon contents neutral to the peritoneal irritation is small, early peritonitis is not obvious, easy to misdiagnosis, late local pollution is serious (the most bacteria in the feces), plus the colon has ileocecal valve and anal sphincter both ends ""closed"", so that the intestinal pressure is increased the intestinal contents are overflowing a lot, causing serious infection of the abdominal cavity, serious symptoms of systemic toxicity, and even death. the colon wall is thin and the blood circulation is poor. therefore, the healing ability of the colon is ruptured and sutured, and it is easy to form intestinal fistula. it is a common concomitant disease. disease. penetrating injury (20%): the most common, usually seen in peacetime and wartime, such as knives, scissors and sharp sharps, explosions and gunshot wounds, etc. caused by open abdominal injury, can cause different degrees of colon damage.","['abdominal tenderness', 'guanjue silver', 'intestines', 'tension', 'moving dullness', 'peritoneal irritation', 'abdominal pain', 'disgusting', 'gas phlegm', 'toxic giant colon ', 'peritonitis']",['anemia'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

crohn's disease,"crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory granulomatous disease of the gastrointestinal tract that is not well understood. the disease is caused by a combination of factors such as infection factors, environmental factors, genetic factors, and immune factors.lesions are more common in the distal ileum and adjacent colon, but the digestive tract can be affected from the oral cavity to the anus. it is segmental or leaping.clinically, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal mass, fistula formation and intestinal obstruction are characterized by systemic manifestations such as fever and extraintestinal damage such as joints, skin, eyes and oral mucosa.the disease has a tendency to relapse throughout life, and patients with severe disease are prolonged and have a poor prognosis.the age of onset is mostly between 15 and 30 years old, but the first episode can occur in any age group, and the prevalence rate of men and women is similar.the disease is more common in europe and the united states, and there is an increasing trend.the incidence of this disease in china is not high, but it is not uncommon. the disease is treated internally and surgically. most patients can get the disease relieved and stable and have a good quality of life and health. the drug treatment mainly includes 5-aminosalicylic acid preparations, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants and biological agents. .non-pharmacological treatment methods mainly include fecal transplantation therapy and granulocyte adsorption therapy.patients with severe conditions or complicated obstruction, intestinal fistula, etc. need surgery for treatment.","daily prevention chinese medicine believes that the disease is caused by spleen and kidney weakness, feelings of external evils, emotional internal injuries, eating and fatigue, etc. modern medicine believes that the cause of crohn's disease is not clear, and may be closely related to viral infection, immunity, and genetic factors. relationships, combined with chinese and western perspectives, can be prevented from life, diet, spiritual care, and physical fitness. 1, living and living should be regular; 2, fasting and unclean food; 3, spiritual nursed back to health; 4, appropriate physical exercise; this disease is a chronic recurrent disease, because the cause is unknown, there is no fundamental cure, many patients have more than one complication in their course of disease requiring surgery, and the recurrence rate of surgical treatment is very high, as reported by up to 90%, the recurrence rate of the disease and the extent of the disease and the intensity of the disease invasion and other factors in addition, the mortality rate is not high. in addition, with the prolongation of the disease course and the increase of age, the recurrence rate gradually decreases and the ratio of healthy people increases. in recent years, various treatment measures have been effective for most patients, which can help the patient experienced the difficulty of the disease activity period.","first, the cause of the disease has not been determined so far. recent studies have tended to suggest that the disease may be the result of a combination of genetic susceptibility and a variety of exogenous factors. 1. genetic susceptibility (1) genetic factors: a large amount of data indicates that crohn's disease is related to genetic factors. the study found that the coincidence rate of crohn's disease among twins with single egg development was significantly higher, at 67%, while the twins of twins had a coincidence ratio of only 8%. at the same time, it was found that patients with crohn's disease showed inconsistency with their spouses and did not differ from the general population. the above indicates that the disease has family aggregation. it has also been reported that the jewish family has a high incidence of the disease in the jewish family compared with non-jewish people and finds mainly those of the ash kenazi race. the survey of askenazi people scattered around the world has a higher incidence of crohn's disease than those of non-askens children living in the same area. perhaps the askenaz jews represent humans. people with genetic susceptibility. it has also been reported that patients with crohn's disease are more associated with hla-dr4 type serum antigens. how genetic factors affect the occurrence of this disease is unclear. some people think that genetics determine the body's immune response. the genetic factors of patients with inflammatory bowel disease determine that they have an excessive immune response to some antigenic substances in the intestinal lumen. (2) changes in susceptibility: at present, most scholars believe that the occurrence of crohn's disease may be related to the abnormal immune response of the body to various antigens stimulated in the intestine. a growing body of evidence suggests increased t cell activation in the lamina propria of crohn's disease, including increased expression of surface markers for t cell activation, increased production of t cell cytokines, and increased cytotoxic t cell function. this increase in t cell activation leads to aggregation of effector cells such as neutrophils. subsequent synthesis of destructive substances (such as proteases and reactive oxygen metabolites) results in intestinal damage in crohn's disease. the triggering mechanism of t cell activation is unclear. in the past, there was some conviction that it was caused by chronic mycobacterial infection, but there is no reliable evidence. it is currently believed that it may not be singular and is more likely to be activated by a number of widely occurring triggering substances. the fundamental defect of crohn's disease leads to the permanent activation of t cells, a defect that is currently being explored. it may be a foreign antigen, increased antigen delivery (increased intestinal permeability), and a genetically predisposed mucosal immune disorder. the result of a complex interaction. current research indicates that the view that this disease was once considered an autoimmune disorder is inaccurate. in fact, there is no credible evidence that there is an immune response directly associated with any autoantigen that can cause the inflammatory process observed in crohn's disease. 2, exogenous factors (1) infectious factors: in early years, the pathological manifestations of crohn's disease were similar to those of non-calcified tuberculosis. it was suspected that the disease was caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the pathogen was not isolated by various methods. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were reports of mycobacteria of kansasii or mycobacteria similar to mycobacterium tuberculosis in the intestinal segment and mesenteric lymph nodes excised from crohn's disease. studies have found that these mycobacteria inoculated in the peritoneal cavity of mice can cause granuloma in the liver and spleen and develop acid-fast bacilli. these acid-fast bacilli are then administered orally to the dairy sheep, and non-caseal granuloma can occur at the end of the ileum of the sheep after several months. it is believed that mycobacteria may be the cause of crohn's disease. however, some authors have observed that these mycobacteria are also present in some non-inflammatory bowel diseases or normal human intestinal tissues, and it has been reported that streptococcus faecalis can cause local granuloma in the intestinal wall of rabbits, so these branches are not certain. bacilli is the exact cause of the disease. it has also been suspected that the cause of crohn's disease is a virus. in 1970, mitchell and rees inoculated mesenteric lymph nodes and tissue homogenates from patients with crohn's disease through a 220 nm filter screen and inoculated on the toes of rats. after 6-24 months, epithelioid cell granuloma and giant cell granuloma occurred on the toes of rats. in the same way, granuloma can occur in the ileum of rabbits. immunosuppressive drugs have no effect on the pathogenesis, suggesting that there may be an infectious microorganism that may be a virus. however, the results of this experiment have not been repeated. it is also believed that crohn's disease is associated with viral infections such as measles and influenza. however, the true virus particles have not been isolated from the intestinal tissue of crohn's disease patients, so the cause of this disease cannot be confirmed as a virus. (2) environmental factors: the incidence of urban residents is higher than that of rural people. this difference also exists in sweden, where rural health care is high, which may be related to social and economic status. some studies have shown that oral contraceptives increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. but other studies have failed to confirm. numerous studies have shown that smokers are at increased risk of crohn's disease. and smoking can increase the likelihood of recurrence of crohn's disease. the mechanism is still unclear. some potential environmental factors can trigger the development of crohn's disease. the increase in edible refined sugar has been identified as a disadvantage. an ordinary period of birth can also be used as a stimulating factor to cause some pregnant women to develop crohn's disease after childbirth. second, the pathogenesis 1, the distribution of lesions: the disease from the mouth to the anus of any part of the entire gastrointestinal tract can be affected, the lesions are skipping or segmental distribution. simultaneous involvement of the small intestine and colon is the most common, accounting for 40% to 60%; limited to 30% to 40% of the small intestine, mainly in the terminal ileum; lesions occurring in the anus or rectum alone are rare, accounting for 3%, mostly with the small intestine and colonic lesions are present in combination; colons are less common, accounting for 5% to 20%. the stomach or duodenum, esophagus, and oral lesions account for about 10% or less. 2, gross pathology: early lesions are small ulcers of the mouth sores, varying in size. the smallest is the tip of the needle, accompanied by bleeding; the larger one is clearly shallow and the bottom is white. if a small lesion is missed during surgical resection, it can recur from there. typical ulcers are longitudinal or limp, discontinuous, and vary in size. cobblestone-like changes are present in approximately 1/4 of the cases. thickening of the intestinal wall and intestinal stenosis are more common.about 95% of surgical cases have stenosis. some crohn's disease can be seen with multiple inflammatory polyps. 3, microscopic findings: microscopic lesions found in the intestinal mucosa, submucosa and serosal layer, mainly the submucosa.common lymphocyte aggregation can have a germinal center.the location of lymphocyte aggregation is closely related to blood vessels and dilated lymphatic vessels.lymphocyte aggregation of the serosa layer can form a rosette-like pattern.plasma cells, multinucleated cells, and eosinophils can also be seen.a mucosal layer can be seen in the sac abscess.non-case granuloma is one of the important features of this disease. it consists of epithelioid cells and giant cells. there is no cheese necrosis in the center, which is uncommon. it is only found in about 50% of cases.it should be noted that granulomas can also be found in yersinia infection or chlamydia infection, which can be identified by an experienced pathologist.glassy and adenoid inclusions are seen in 5% of cases, as seen in sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.granuloma is often very atypical and has a distinct boundary formed by lymphocytes.it can be seen in the whole layer of the intestinal wall, but the submucosa and serosal layer are most likely to appear.in addition to the intestinal wall, granulomas can also be found in local lymph nodes. the fissure ulcer of the intestinal wall extends deep into the muscularis propria.transmural penetration is the basis for the formation of internal fistulas and cutaneous fistulas and abscesses.the fracture under the naked eye is linear and may have branches, surrounded by edema and island-like mucosa.in the cross section, the fissure branches appear as intramural abscesses. due to edema and lymphatic vessel expansion and an increase in the number of collagen fibers, the submucosa is widened and the intestinal wall is thickened.","['vitamin deficiency', 'gut spleen', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'weight loss', 'diarrhea', 'mucus stool', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation', 'wasting', 'anorexia']","['intestinal obstruction', 'abdominal abscess', 'gastrointestinal bleeding', 'iron deficiency anemia', 'colon cancer']","['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'faecal transplantation therapy', 'granulocyte adsorption therapy', 'surgery', 'chinese medicine treatment']"
1-1-antitrypsin deficiency,"11 antitrypsin deficiency (aatd) is an autosomal co-dominant genetic disease and is a protein-deficient disease.1-1-antitrypsin (aat), also known as 汐1-proteinase inhibitor (汐1-pi), is an important plasma protein mainly synthesized by hepatocytes and has a serine protease inhibitor action.式1-antitrypsin deficiency is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the aat protein, which causes a decrease in the concentration of circulating normal aat protein in the body.often manifested as emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neonatal hepatitis, severe liver disease and liver failure.",early diagnosis of asymptomatic patients can help patients improve their lifestyle to prevent disease progression.,"portal fibrosis and biliary hyperplasia (35%): extensive portal fibrosis, even similar to cirrhosis, with obvious bile duct hyperplasia, jaundice subsided 6 months ago, but liver and spleen sexual enlargement and hardening. in the following 2 cases, portal hypertension occurred, but there was no abnormality in extrahepatic bile ducts. small bile duct dysplasia (25%): normal liver structure, mild hepatocyte injury, only fibrosis in the portal area, but the number of bile ducts is significantly reduced, cholestasis is scattered in the hepatic lobules, clinical progression is progressive jaundice, accompanied by itching and hypercholesterolemia. hepatocyte injury (15%): characterized by hepatocyte enlargement, relatively light inflammatory cell infiltration, and mostly mononuclear cell infiltration, with or without liver fibrosis, may have cholestatic, but no portal vein the gallbladder is formed.","['hepatic enlargement', 'portal hypertension', 'hepatic coma', 'upper gastrointestinal bleeding']",['emphysema'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
ulcerative colitis,"ulcerative colitis (uc), referred to as ulceration, is not fully elucidated, mainly chronic non-specific inflammatory disease invading the colonic mucosa, often from the left colon, to the proximal end of the colon and even the whole colon, the continuous approach is gradually progressing.the clinical symptoms vary in severity, and there may be remission and episodes. patients may have only colon symptoms or systemic symptoms.","reduce allergic foods and damage to intestinal drug intake, reduce mental burden and trauma, avoid infections, maintain long-term maintenance treatment, and reduce recurrence.","(a) the cause of the disease the exact cause of ulcerative colitis is still unclear. at present, the etiology of this disease has the following doctrines. infectious factors (35%): some bacteria and viruses have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. the pathological changes and clinical manifestations of this disease are very similar to those of bacterial dysentery. in some cases, bacteria are cultured in the feces. some cases are effective with antibiotics, which seems to suggest that bacterial infections are associated with this disease. in 1973, fakmer cultured cytomegalovirus (cmv) from 6 cases of ulcerative colitis. in 1977, cooper also developed from patients with toxic colonic dilatation. isolation of cytomegalovirus. in recent years, some studies have found that mycobacterium paratuberculosis, paramyxovirus, and listeria moncytogenes may also be associated with ulcerative colon. inflammation is related to the onset of crohn's disease. therefore, it is suggested that certain bacteria or viruses may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. but which pathogen infection causes the disease, is the infectious pathogen the cause of the disease the results require further research to determine. immunological factors (28%): people who hold this view believe that autoimmune-mediated tissue damage is one of the important factors in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. some authors have found that some pathogens (such as e. coli, etc.) that invade the intestinal wall have cross-antigens with human intestinal epithelial cells. when the body infects these pathogens, the autoantibodies in the circulation not only kill the pathogens in the intestinal wall but also kill their own epithelial cells. in recent years, a 40kd antigen has been found in the colonic epithelium of patients with ulcerative colitis. it activates the body to produce anti-colon epithelial antibodies and also activates complement and antigen-antibody complexes on the surface of colonic epithelium. after activation of immune lymphocytes and macrophages in patients with ulcerative colitis, a variety of cytokines and vasoactive activities are released. substance, promotes and aggravates the inflammatory response of tissues, has reported the role of cd95 (tnf-like)-mediated colonic epithelial cell apoptosis in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and found in areas of colonic inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis cd95-cd95l-mediated apoptosis occurs in adjacent non-inflammatory regions, inferred to be ulcerative one of the possible causes of the spread of enteritis. in addition, in recent years, it has been reported that antibodies and t lymphocytes in the body's circulation interact with heat shock protein (hsp) in intestinal epithelial cells of patients with ulcerative colitis, resulting in intestinal epithelial damage in ulcers. the results of t, b lymphocyte count determination, blood leukocyte, macrophage and lymphocyte transformation rate in patients with colitis suggest that the disease is related to changes in cellular immunology. genetic factors (15%): some data indicate that ulcerative colitis is closely related to genetic factors, racial differences in caucasians are significantly higher than blacks, and asians have the lowest incidence, among which caucasians the incidence of jews is 2 to 4 times higher than that of non-jewish people, and about 50% less in colored people. the incidence of twin twins is higher than that of twins. the authors report tissue-associated antigen hla in patients with ulcerative colitis. -dr2 is more common than normal people. japanese scholars have recently reported that the specific gene phenotype p-anca (peinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) found in patients with ulcerative colitis is significantly higher than the normal population. mental factors (15%): the role of mental factors in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis may be related to the autonomic dysfunction caused by mental disorders, leading to inflammation of the intestinal wall and ulcer formation, but some authors have compared the patients with ulcerative colitis with the normal population. there is no obvious mental incentive. on the contrary, after colectomy due to ulcerative colitis, the patient's original mental morbidity such as depression, anxiety, nervousness and suspicious symptoms are significantly improved. it seems that the mental factor is not caused by this. the cause of the disease is more like the consequences of the disease. (b) the pathogenesis 1, lesions ulcerative colitis can occur in any part of the colorectal, more common in the rectum and sigmoid colon, but also involving the ascending colon and other parts of the colon, or involving the entire colon, a small total colon involvement invasion of the terminal ileum, the affected intestine is mostly limited to the terminal ileum within 10cm from the ileocecal valve. in the data of 78 cases of ulcerative colitis in the surgical group of the people's hospital of beijing medical university, 38 cases involving the whole colon, accounting for 48.7%, rectum there were 32 cases (41%) with sigmoid colon, 8 cases with ileum, cecum and ascending colon, accounting for 10.2%, and 5 cases (6.4%) with invasive ileum alone. 2, pathological morphology (1) general morphology: ulcerative colitis is mainly mucosal inflammation, its complications are less than crohn's disease, so the surgical resection of the specimen due to complications without crohn's disease, pulp the film layer is generally intact, the appearance is smooth, the gloss, the blood vessels are congested, the intestinal tube is shortened, and the distal colon and rectum are most obvious. generally, the fibrous tissue hyperplasia is not seen, the surface of the intestinal mucosa is grainy, brittle, extensively hyperemic and bleeding, and there are many a superficial ulcer with linear or plaque-like distribution along the colonic zone. in severe cases, large mucosal exfoliation is observed, and even the muscular layer is exposed. the mucosal lesions are continuous, starting from the rectum or sigmoid colon, often far away. the proximal segment is light, the left colon is heavy, the right colon is light, and many inflammatory polyps of various sizes and shapes are seen on the surface of the mucosa. it is more common in the colon, less common in the rectum, and sometimes inflammatory polyps are seen. a mucosal bridge formed by adhesion. (2) histomorphology: mucosa and submucosa are highly congested, edematous, diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, initial inflammation is limited to the mucosa, in the epithelium and glands inflammation can progress to the submucosa after injury, generally does not involve the muscular layer and serosal layer, neutrophils infiltrate the intestinal epithelium, can lead to cryptitis and crypt abscess, epithelial cell proliferation, goblet cell reduction or disappear, small most of the ulcers are located in the mucosal layer, which is diffusely distributed. the bottom can reach the submucosal layer, and the whole layer is rarely involved. only the thin layer of granulation tissue is seen at the bottom of the ulcer. visual observation of the case of complete remission after repair, the colonic mucosa is difficult to distinguish from the normal mucosa, but the pathological examination still has abnormal changes, manifested as irregular glandular ducts, and branches, goblet cells, cell enlargement, pan cellular metaplasia, therefore, the most important pathological changes of ulcerative colitis are: 1 diffuse continuous mucosal inflammation, 2 mucosal ulcers, 3 crypt abscesses, 4 pseudopolyps, 5 special cell changes, pan cell proliferation, cup decreased cells.","['weakness', 'upper abdomen', 'black stool with blood', 'diarrhea', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation', 'wasting', 'disgusting', 'indigestion']",['rectung cancer'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
phosphorus poisoning,"poisoning caused by exposure to phosphorus.there are acute and chronic points.phosphorus has four allotropes of yellow phosphorus, red phosphorus, purple phosphorus and black phosphorus.yellow phosphorus, also known as white phosphorus, is the most toxic.a human absorption of 1 mg/kg can kill.occupational acute poisoning is more common in production accidents. the skin is burned by molten phosphorus and absorbed into the body to cause poisoning.in daily life, poisoning may occur due to misuse of yellow phosphorus.","the key to prevent poisoning is to use yellow phosphorus as raw material instead of red phosphorus or other chemical substances; pay attention to safe production, strengthen the maintenance of protective equipment and drug storage; do personal protection; pay attention to personal hygiene, the best after exposure to phosphorus rinse with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution; smoke and eat without contaminated hands; personnel engaged in phosphorus production should have regular physical examination, including liver function and x-ray examination of the jaw.those who suffer from serious oral diseases, liver and kidney diseases, blood diseases and endocrine diseases should not engage in phosphorus operations.","the toxicity of yellow phosphorus is very high. the minimum lethal dose to adults is about 60-100 mg, and the lethal dose of zinc phosphide is about 40 mg/kg.when yellow phosphorus enters the human body, its toxicological effect is to destroy the function of the enzyme in the cell, mainly causing damage to the liver, heart, kidney and other parenchymal organs, causing steatosis such as the above organs and striated muscles, peripheral circulatory failure, bone decalcification and bleeding, etc. in addition, yellow phosphorus can cause strong burns and corrosion on the skin and mucous membranes, and can absorb poisoning through the wound surface.phosphate enters the body and reacts with gastric acid to produce phosphine and zinc chloride, which have stimulating and corrosive effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa, causing inflammation, congestion, ulceration and hemorrhage, etc., and the phosphine produced by it in the cellular enzymes, affecting cell metabolism, causing internal suffocation, so that the central nervous system, respiratory, cardiovascular system and liver and kidney function are affected, and the central nervous system is the earliest and most severely affected.","['coma', 'central nervous system inhibitor...', 'blood pressure drop', 'breathing difficulty', 'delirium', 'abdominal pain', 'dizziness', 'disgusting', 'consciousness blurry', 'gastrointestinal tract symptom']",['pulmonary edema'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

carcinoid,"carcinoid, also known as carcinoid tumor, is a group of new organisms that occur in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs of chromaffin cells.in addition to the esophagus, carcinogenesis can occur in any part of the digestive tract. it is more common in the appendix and is more common in women, followed by the stomach, duodenum, colon (more common in men), gallbladder and meckel's diverticulum. it can also occur in the bronchi and ovaries, but it is less common.","as the cause of this disease has not yet been fully elucidated, it is important to pay attention to some dietary and environmental risk factors that cause cancer.","the etiology of this disease has not yet been elucidated. carcinoma is a tumor that produces small molecular peptides or peptide hormones, that is, apud cell tumors, which can increase the activity of circulating adenine monophosphate through target cells, and can secrete strong physiological active serotonin (serotonin), vasopressin and histamine, and some hormones that secrete other peptides, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, catecholamine, growth hormone, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, anti-urea, gonadotropin, insulin, glucagon, prostaglandins, gastrin, motilin and other substances, the main substances producing carcinoid syndrome are serotonin and bradykinin, and histamine also participates in some functions. serotonin has a direct contraction effect on peripheral blood vessels and pulmonary blood vessels, and also has a strong contraction effect on the bronchus. it has a stimulating effect on the vagus nerve and ganglion cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and the gastrointestinal tract peristalsis is enhanced and the secretion is increased. bradykinin has a strong vasodilator effect. some carcinoid tumors, especially gastric carcinoids, can produce a large amount of bradykinin, vasoactive substances such as histamine and cause skin flushing. increased circulating serotonin can also cause endocardial fibers. chemical. under normal circumstances, only about 2% of the tryptophan intake in food is used as a synthesis of serotonin (5-ht), 98% into the metabolic pathway of niacin and protein synthesis, but in patients with carcinoid syndrome. 60% of tryptophan can be taken up by tumor cells, resulting in increased 5-ht synthesis, reduced niacin synthesis, and 60% of tryptophan uptake of tumor cells by tryptophan hydroxylase to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-htp), which is then converted to 5-ht by dopa decarboxylase, partially stored in the secretory granules of the tumor cells, and the rest directly enters the blood. most of the 5-ht free in the blood passes through the liver and lungs. monoamine oxidase (mao) in the brain is degraded into 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) and excreted from the urine. the level of 5-ht in the serum of carcinoid patients originating from the midgut system is elevated, while 5-hiaa in the urine is discharged. increase, this is a typical carcinoid syndrome, this accounted for more than 75% of cases of carcinoid syndrome, the foregut system carcinoid often lacks dopa decarboxylase, can not make 5-htp into 5-ht, 5- htp is directly released into the blood, so the 5-htp level in the patient's serum is elevated, while the 5-ht is not elevated, and the patient's urine 5-htp and 5-ht are discharged. was added, while no significant increase in 5-hiaa, namely atypical carcinoid syndrome. more than 90% of carcinoid tumors occur in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the appendix, terminal ileum and rectum, and a few occur in the colon, stomach, duodenum, mckeel diverticulum and biliary tract, pancreatic duct, gonad, lung and bronchus, etc. ethnic groups, the prevalence of carcinoids may be different, in the case of japan in the stomach, duodenum and colon carcinoids are more than in europe and the united states, small intestine carcinoids, it is speculated that this may be with japan people and europeans and americans have different distributions of chromogranin cells in various organs. godwin comprehensively 2837 cases of carcinoid, 85.5% distributed in the gastrointestinal tract, the gastrointestinal tract outside the bronchial, lung, head, liver, pancreas, cervix, parotid gland, urethra, even testis or ovary, orloff comprehensive literature 3000 cases the distribution of gastrointestinal carcinoids was 47.0% in the appendix, 27.5% in the ileum, 17.0% in the rectum, 2.5% in the stomach, 2.0% in the colon, 1.5% in the jejunum, 1.3% in the duodenum, 1.0% in the meckel diverticulum, and 0.2% in the gallbladder. most of them are seen in the appendix, and the appendix, ileum and rectum account for more than 90% of all gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. typical gastrointestinal carcinoid, tumor is often a small yellow or gray submucosal nodular mass, single or multiple, mucosal surface more complete, its shape is different, nodular, polypoid or ring a few tumors can form ulcers on the surface, which looks like adenocarcinoma, often invading the muscle layer and serosal layer. some patients may have multiple-type carcinoid tumors. the ileal carcinoid is often multiple, the tumor is small, and the diameter is 3.5. below cm, mostly in 1.5cm, a group of 78 cases in china, rectal carcinoid sites are in the rectum below 10cm, the tumor size is about 0.2 ~ 2.5cm, more than 1.0cm, shaped like polyps, but no pedicle, cut face view it is gray or grayish yellow, hard and has a clear boundary. the cancer-like cells are square, columnar, polygonal or circular under the microscope, the nucleus is uniform, there is little mitotic phase, and the cytoplasm contains eosinophilic particles. according to electron microscopy, the cytoplasm of various parts of the gastrointestinal tract is intracytoplasmic. the morphology of the particles and histochemistry are different. the small intestine cancer cells contain large and polymorphic particles. the silver staining reaction is positive, so it is pro-silver. the particles of gastric cancer cells are round. when silver staining reaction, it must be adding an exogenous reducing agent is a positive reaction, so it is argyrophilic. the rectal cancer cells are large, round, uniform, and the staining reactions of both silver and silver are negative, so they are non-reactive. the histological structure of carcinoids is characterized by a variety of arrangement of tumor cells, and soga et al. are classified into 5 types according to the arrangement. type a cancer cells accumulate in solid nodular nests. the cells are roughly circular, irregularly arranged, and infiltrated around the cord. they are more common in carcinoids of the midgut system and are the most typical type. b-type tumor cells have a small structure, arranged in a layer, such as a shell, the nucleus in the peripheral part, arranged neatly like a grid or strip, more common in carcinoid originating from the foregut system. type c square cells are arranged in a glandular shape, but there are no cavities or rosettes. d-type tumor cells are irregular in shape and irregularly arranged, forming a large myeloid structure. types c and d are more common in carcinoid originating from the hindgut system. the e type is various hybrid types of the above four types. the atypical hyperplasia and mitotic phase of carcinoid are not obvious. it is generally difficult to judge the degree of malignancy from the cell morphology. reference can be made to the size of the type 1 cancer, comprehensive 843 surgical data, the maximum diameter of 1cm or less, 90%~ 100% manifested as a benign course, between 1 and 2cm, 30% to 50% have metastasis, diameter >2cm, 80% to 100% have metastasis, 2 degree of infiltration, according to statistics have invaded the gastrointestinal muscle layer cancer, 90% of metastasis, 3 growth sites, appendix carcinoids are almost benign, even if it has infiltrated into the serosa, metastasis is still rare (<2%). the metastasis rate of small intestine carcinoid is 30%, and the colon is 38%. the malignant carcinoid of duodenum and stomach is rarer than the small intestine. carcinoid metastasis can directly infiltrate and grow, penetrate the serosa to the surrounding tissues, lymphatic metastasis or hematogenous metastasis, no local lymph node metastasis and direct hematogenous metastasis. occasionally, there are reports of hematogenous metastasis. it can also be transferred to bone, lung and brain. other rare metastatic sites are reported: ovary, epididymis, skin, bone marrow, posterior peritoneum, eyelid, adrenal gland, spleen, pancreas, kidney, thyroid gland, bladder, prostate, child the cervix also reports of metastasis into the breast, and its clinical signs are very similar to those of the primary breast cancer. carcinoid cells originate from the enterochromaffin cells (also known as kulchitsky cells) in the apud cell system. these cells are derived from embryonic neural crests and are widely distributed in the digestive tract. they have chromophore-pro-silver particles and can produce a variety of peptide amines. hormones, in recent years, with the advancement of immunohistochemical techniques, a variety of hormones have been confirmed in tissue sections. carcinoid syndrome is a metabolite produced by the liver due to serotonin and various vasoactive substances, and enters the lungs through the blood. the heart, the pulmonary artery and subendocardial fibrous tissue hyperplasia, about half of the cases with right heart valve disease, including pulmonary valve and tricuspid valve thickening, shortening, stiffness, adhesion, endocardial and chordae can be fiber thickening , causing pulmonary stenosis, tricuspid atresia, etc., the left subendocardial elastic fiber has focal or diffuse fibrous hyperplasia and other heart disease, especially bronchial carcinogenesis, left heart, pulmonary artery, tricuspid valve, aortic valve fibrosis

diffuse esophageal fistula,"diffuse esophageal spasm is a disease of esophageal dysmotility, a rare esophageal dyskinesia, which can cause difficulty in swallowing and chest pain. the lesion is mainly located in the lower part of the esophagus, and the normal esophageal propulsive peristalsis disappears, which is intense. non-propelled continuous contraction replaces, causing the esophagus to spiral or beaded.","pay attention to avoid emotional excitement, nervous incentives, regulate eating habits, avoid eating too cold, overheating and other irritating foods, chew slowly, develop good eating habits, eat slowly, avoid cold and thick food.","(1) causes of the disease the function of the esophagus is to feed the food into the stomach through the esophageal sphincter barrier and the peristaltic contraction of the esophagus itself, and to prevent the gastrointestinal contents from flowing back to the esophagus. the esophageal motor dysfunction may be caused by poor esophageal contraction or abnormal esophageal sphincter function, or if the esophageal peristalsis is too weak, the food group cannot be delivered, and if the peristalsis is too strong or the peristalsis is prolonged, swallowing pain and dysphagia may occur, and abnormal esophageal sphincter function may also produce similar symptoms, that is, if the sphincter is flaccid poor can interfere with the delivery of the bolus. if the sphincter tension is low, the contraction of the gastroesophageal reflux will occur. esophageal dysfunction can be divided into primary and secondary, primary include achalasia, diffuse esophageal fistula, etc.; secondary is caused by systemic diseases, diffuse esophageal sputum it belongs to the primary esophageal motor dysfunction, and the cause of the disease is unknown. some authors have suggested that diffuse esophageal fistula is an independent disease, which is the result of secondary neuropathy, the so-called ""neuromyopathy theory"". the disorder of esophageal motor function is caused by the degeneration of the vagus esophageal branch or fiber break, and the nerve. there is no degeneration in the section. some authors believe that the cause of diffuse esophageal fistula and achalasia may be the same, because 3% to 5% of diffuse esophageal fistula can progress to achalasia, so it is pointed out that diffuse esophageal fistula may be in a transitional period of achalasia formation, narducci et al. (1985) reported that the nutcracker esophagus can be converted to diffuse esophageal fistula. ingelfinge (1967) also reported that patients with diffuse esophageal fistula eventually converted to achalasia. strong achalasia can be a common manifestation of achalasia and diffuse esophageal fistula. it can be seen that these esophageal dyskinesias are closely related. other authors suggest that diffuse esophageal fistula may be a syndrome caused by multiple causes, such as mental factors can lead to the disease (such as a history of traumatic episodes often after emotional agitation, typical patients often have neurotic personality, symptoms may be related to emotional stress), other factors such as gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal corrosive damage, cold drink cold food and other stimulating esophageal mucosa and sensitivity to gastrin can induce esophageal fistula, and sometimes certain drugs, such as domperidone can also induce diffuse esophageal spasm.

chronic gastritis,"chronic gastritis (chronic gastritis) refers to chronic inflammation or atrophic lesions of the gastric mucosa caused by different causes. the essence is that after the gastric mucosal epithelium suffers repeated damage, due to the mucous membrane-specific regenerative ability, the mucosa is remodeled and eventually leads to irreversible intrinsic the atrophy of the stomach gland even disappears.the disease is very common, accounting for 80-90% of patients undergoing gastroscopy. men are more than women, and the incidence increases with age. chronic superficial gastritis and chronic atrophic gastritis are the two most common chronic gastritis.the clinical incidence of chronic gastritis in children and chronic gastritis in the elderly has gradually increased in recent years.","daily prevention of chronic gastritis 1, to maintain a happy spirit: depression or excessive tension and fatigue, easy to cause pyloric sphincter dysfunction, bile reflux and chronic gastritis. 2, harmful components in tobacco can promote the increase of gastric acid secretion, harmful stimulation of the gastric mucosa, excessive smoking can cause bile reflux.excessive drinking or long-term drinking of spirits can make the gastric mucosa congestion, edema, and even erosion, and the incidence of chronic gastritis is significantly increased.you should quit smoking and avoid alcohol. 3, with caution, avoid using drugs that have damage to the gastric mucosa.long-term abuse of such drugs can cause damage to the gastric mucosa, causing chronic gastritis and ulcers. 4, active treatment of oropharyngeal infections, do not swallow sputum, nasal discharge and other bacterial secretions into the stomach leading to chronic gastritis. 5, too acidic, too spicy and other irritating foods and cold and difficult to digest food should be avoided, eat slowly, so that the food is fully mixed with saliva, is conducive to digestion and reduce stomach irritation.diet should be quantitative, nutrient-rich, foods containing more vitamins a, b, and c.avoid stimulating drinks such as strong tea and espresso. chronic gastritis health education people often say that ""people eat whole grains and grains, and they can have no disease.""the entrance to the diet, the first thing that affects the stomach.the gastric mucosa is rich in blood vessels and has functions of storing, digesting and transporting food.therefore, the diet is an important factor that causes stomach problems.chronic gastritis is a very common digestive tract disease. the non-specific inflammation of the gastric mucosa is the main pathological change. according to the histological changes of the gastric mucosa, it can be divided into three types: superficial, atrophic and hypertrophic.common symptoms in the clinic are: upper abdominal swelling, pain, frequent hernia, pantothenic acid, loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea and other symptoms.since dietary factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis, developing good eating habits is the key to preventing gastritis, which is also different from other diseases.in general, the following points are achieved when eating, and chronic gastritis has to be cured by half. should be slow.chewing slowly can reduce the stimulation of the gastric mucosa by rough foods. yijie.diet should have rhythm, avoid overeating and eating without timing. yi jie.pay attention to food hygiene and prevent external microbes from invading the gastric mucosa. should be fine.try to eat food that is finer, more digestible and nutritious. should be light.eat less fat, sweet, thick, greasy, spicy and other foods, drink less alcohol and strong tea.","it has been clarified that hp infection is the most important cause of chronic gastritis. some people call it hp-related gastritis, but other physical, chemical and biological harmful factors can cause this disease for a long time. chronic lesions can be formed by persistence or recurrence. a random sampling method for gastric mucosal examination in rural finland confirms that chronic atrophic gastritis is a chronic progressive disease with superficial inflammation and eventually irreversible atrophy. inflammation, from clinical observations, there is also evidence to explain this problem. young people are mostly superficial gastritis, and the elderly are mostly atrophic gastritis; superficial gastritis and atrophic gastritis often exist in the same patient at the same time; mucosal biopsy has also found that some superficial gastritis can become atrophic gastritis after several years. it is currently believed that chronic gastritis is caused by many factors. in 1982, marshall and warren first isolated a micro-aerobic, catalase-positive, gram-negative spirochete with urease activity, 3 米m G 0.5 米m in size, curved or s-shaped, with 2 to 6 sheaths at one end. flagella, active gastritis 95% of this bacterial infection, originally named campylobacter-like microorganism (clo), later renamed pylobacter pylori, in 1989 changed its name to pyloric screw according to its biochemical and morphological characteristics bacteria, we have confirmed through clinical studies that the detection rate of hp in chronic active gastritis is 98%-100%, indicating that chronic gastritis, especially chronic active gastritis is closely related to hp infection, marshall, 1985, morris ii, 1987 humans themselves as volunteers oral hp caused acute gastritis, cured by antibiotic treatment, in 1987 lam bert successfully established an animal model of hp gastritis with suckling pigs, so hp has basically met koch's criteria for pathogenic bacteria. the main mechanism of hp causing gastritis is as follows: 1. hp is spiral and has a flagella structure, which can move freely in the mucus layer. 2. hp has a target site on the mucus, which can bind to the glycoprotein and glycolipid targets of epithelial cells and mucus. 3, close contact with mucosal cells, and ""attachment pedestal""-like structure with epithelial cells, so that the microvilli fall off and the cytoskeleton is destroyed. 4, the production of a variety of enzymes and metabolites, such as urease and its products ammonia, superoxide dismutase, proteolytic enzymes, phospholipase a2 and c, our experiments confirmed that hp positive individuals gastric mucosa and gastric juice ammonia is significantly higher than hp negative individuals, indicating that urease hydrolyzes large amounts of urea in the stomach to produce large amounts of ammonia, which can cause significant gastric mucosal damage in animal experiments. 5. cytotoxin can cause vacuolar degeneration of cells. 6. after hp infection, gastric epithelial cells release il-1, 8 and other cytokines and tnf2 factors, causing neutrophils to migrate from the blood vessels to the gastric epithelium and activate them, which release metabolites and proteolytic enzymes. it can damage the gastric mucosa, and it can also cause activation of monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, etc., further aggravating the damage of the gastric mucosa. 7. immune response: hp infection can cause or aggravate the formation of gastritis by cellular immunity, humoral immunity (production of antibodies) and induction of autoimmune reactions in the body. due to the infection of hp, a large number of mononuclear cells infiltrate in the lamina propria, and the destruction of epithelial cells is directly proportional to the degree of bacterial infiltration and the closeness of bacterial contact with cells. when neutrophils appear, they are indicators of inflammatory activity, and surface mucus disappears. cell degeneration and necrosis, a large number of neutrophils pass through the glandular neck into the glandular fossa, forming a glandular abscess (tubular), which greatly affects the regeneration of the gland. when neutrophil infiltration is obvious, bacteria and cells the decrease in contact rate may be the result of an immune response, and the surface of the bacteria is surrounded by igg to prevent contact with the cells. the genetic predisposition of type a gastritis (gastric gastritis) vars and siurala have done a lot of work. they found that the incidence of gastritis in the first-degree relatives of pernicious anemia is significantly higher than that of the general population. the risk of severe atrophic gastritis is random. 20 times of the population, they believe that it plays an autosomal dominant gene. the study of gastric antrum gastritis also shows family aggregation. therefore, the genetic susceptibility of the human body plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis. . clinical statistics show that the incidence of chronic gastritis is significantly positively correlated with age. the older the age, the worse the gastric mucosal function, the ""resistance"", and the damage caused by external adverse factors. the incidence of gastritis in severe smokers can be increased. eward found that 40% of people who smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day had gastric mucosal inflammation, and oddson et al's gastric mucosal biopsy also showed this link. beaumont passed the first observation of alcohol in patients with stomach cramps to produce flaky flushing of the gastric mucosa. later, it was confirmed by gastroscopic observation, but it was restored after stopping drinking. wood used blind biopsy to observe 51 cases of chronic alcoholics. superficial gastritis, but it stops when drinking is stopped. if it persists for a long time, it can develop into chronic atrophic gastritis. palmer also found that soldiers who drink alcohol have superficial inflammation of the stomach. after stopping drinking for 3 weeks, inflammation can disappear. wolf through 1006 cases of investigation, it was found that drinking was closely related to gastritis. most cases with inflammation were older, so age was also considered as an important factor in addition to alcohol. animals with high concentration of alcohol could form acute gastric injury but could not form. chronic gastritis, low concentration of alcohol is not only harmless but also protective. it is speculated that low concentration of alcohol can increase the prostaglandin level of gastric mucosa. prostaglandins have protective effect on gastric mucosa. our observational materials suggest chronic gastritis drinkers. not much to see. various condiments and irritating foods promote the secretion of gastric acid, but have not been proven to cause chronic gastritis. drug non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin and phenylbutazone can cause gastric mucosal erosion, chronic gastritis can be left behind after erosion, and some antibiotics also have some damage to the gastric mucosa, but there is no evidence for long-term taking can cause atrophic gastritis.","['upper gastrointestinal bleeding', 'middle upper abdominal

adhesive intestinal obstruction,"adhesive intestinal obstruction refers to the intra-abdominal intestinal adhesion caused by various reasons, which causes the intestinal contents to not pass and run smoothly in the intestine.when the contents of the intestines are blocked, a series of symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and defecation disorders may occur.it belongs to the category of mechanical intestinal obstruction. according to the onset of illness, it can be divided into acute intestinal obstruction and chronic intestinal obstruction; according to the degree of obstruction, it can be divided into complete intestinal obstruction and incomplete intestinal obstruction; according to the obstruction site can be divided into high and low high intestinal obstruction is small intestinal obstruction, low position refers to terminal small intestine (ileum) and colon obstruction; according to intestinal blood supply, it is divided into simple intestinal obstruction and strangulated intestinal obstruction.most of the adhesive intestinal obstruction can be relieved by non-surgical treatment, but recurrent or conservative treatment is ineffective, surgery can be considered.","timely and correct treatment of abdominal inflammation is important to prevent adhesions.it is also necessary to pay special attention to: hematoma formed by incomplete abdominal hemostasis, exposed to the abdominal cavity for too long or gauze dressing for a long time to cover the damaged serosa, blood clot, residual abdominal cavity, peritoneal tear, defect, large tissue ligation, placement of abdominal drainage, etc., are all iatrogenic factors that contribute to adhesion. most of the intra-abdominal adhesions do not lead to intestinal obstruction. the occurrence of obstruction often has some incentives. patients with a history of abdominal surgery must be reminded to pay attention to: (1) the diet should be regular, avoid overeating, and prevent a large amount of food from entering the affected by adhesion. in the proximal intestine; develop good bowel habits. (2) pay attention to food hygiene, prevent gastrointestinal inflammation, and avoid abnormal peristalsis of the intestine; (3) it is not advisable to do vigorous physical activity after meals, especially the sudden change of body position.","intestinal obstruction is easy to occur under the following conditions: external factors (40%): 1. the contents of the proximal intestine suddenly increase after binge eating, and can not smoothly pass through the narrow intestinal lumen, forming a relative obstruction. 2, inflammation or adhesion edema in the adhesion site, as well as food debris, foreign body blockage, can lead to intestinal stenosis. internal factors (30%): a group of intestinal fistulas are closely adhered to each other.and fixed under the abdominal wall incision scar, because the intestinal lumen is small, intestinal peristalsis is affected, the intestine can not expand, prone to obstruction.a segment of intestinal fistula adheres and is fixed at its own folded position, so that the intestinal lumen at the tortuous portion is narrow and prone to obstruction. a section of intestinal fistula adheres to a point farther away, and due to pulling the intestinal fistula to make the adhesion point an acute angle, obstruction is easy to occur.the other end of the abdominal cord-like adhesion is fixed to the posterior wall of the abdomen, and the intestinal tube is compressed to cause obstruction. strangulated intestinal obstruction (20%): the intestinal wall adheres to the abdomen wall, and other parts of the intestinal tract do not adhere. due to strong intestinal peristalsis or sudden changes in body posture, the intestinal fistula may be twisted with the adhesion as a fulcrum, causing the twist narrow intestinal obstruction.","['intestinal', 'aphid intestinal obstruction', 'peritoneal irritation', 'abdominal tension', 'abdominal pain', 'fecal vomit', 'low fever', 'peritonitis']",['stomach ache'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
cystic fibrosis,"a hereditary exocrine gland disease that primarily affects the respiratory and digestive systems and can also affect the reproductive system.it is usually characterized by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficient pancreatic exocrine function, and abnormally elevated sweat electrolytes. there are many possible treatments for the clinical manifestations and complications of cystic fibrosis.the main goal of treatment is to prevent infection, reduce the amount and viscosity of the secretions in the lungs, improve breathing, and maintain adequate nutrition.","the course of the disease varies greatly, depending on the extent of lung involvement. however, deterioration is unavoidable, leading to failure and eventual death, usually due to both respiratory failure and pulmonary heart disease.in daily life, it is necessary to prevent cold and keep warm, reduce cold and respiratory infections; avoid contact with harmful gases or dust, particles, etc.; diet rules, avoid eating irritating foods; seek medical treatment for changes in the condition.the lung, spleen and kidney can be adjusted by chinese medicine to improve the overall disease resistance of the body.at the same time, diet can be appropriate to eat yam, glutinous rice, jujube, etc. to strengthen the spleen and stomach; black sesame, walnuts, etc. to tonify kidney and essence; white radish digestion and phlegm; lily, american ginseng, medlar, etc. to benefit qi and yin.","cystic fibrosis (cf) is the most common hereditary disease with shortened life span in whites. the incidence rate in the united states is about 1/3300 white infants, 1/15300 black infants, 1/32000 asian americans; 30% the patient is an adult. cf is autosomal recessive, with 3% of genes in whites.the related gene is located on the 250,000 base pair of chromosome 7q (long arm) genomic dna, which encodes a membrane-associated protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulatory substrate (cftr).the most common gene mutation, 忖f508, results in the deletion of a phenylalanine residue at the 508 position of the cftr protein and occurs in about 70% of the alleles; another 30% has more than 600 rare mutations. the function of cftr is not clear, but it is clearly a part of the chloride channel regulated by camp, and regulates the transport of chlorine and sodium across the cell membrane. the heterozygote has no abnormal clinical symptoms, but there is a mild abnormality in epithelial membrane transport. cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the cf gene on chromosome 7.the patient is homozygous and his parents are heterozygous.half of the patient's siblings can carry recessive genes, and 1/4 can get sick.heterozygous genes with recessive genes generally account for 2% to 5% of newborns, and one in 2000 to 2500 newborns.the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis exocrine gland dysfunction is unclear.studies have shown that the patient's epithelial cells have defective chloride channel regulation, and the transmembrane transport of water and electrolyte in the mucosal epithelium of the respiratory tract is impeded. the content of acid glycoprotein in the mucus gland secretion increases, changing the characteristics of mucus rheology, possibly secretory. the reason why the material becomes sticky.","['hepatic insufficiency', 'portal hypertension', 'intestinal atresia', 'hepatomegaly', 'cholelithiasis', 'liver failure']",['arthritis'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']",['multidisciplinary treatment']

boric acid poisoning,"boric acid or borax (sodium borate) can be rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, serosal cavity and damaged skin, so it can be poisoned by internal or topical application.common causes of poisoning in children are as follows: application of boric acid containing boric acid powder, boric acid powder or boric acid ointment to coat large areas of wounds, eczema and diaper rash. the mother is repeatedly sucked with boric acid solution to wash the nipple and sucked by the baby. thirsty or accidentally eat a lot of killing pills (including 30% boric acid); use boric acid solution for physiological saline injection.the lethal dose of oral boric acid in children is generally 5-6g. some infants have died of oral administration of 1g boric acid.","because borate can cause vitamin b2 deficiency, and vitamin b2 can form a water-soluble complex with borate, reduce its cytotoxicity, and assist in elimination, so in the treatment, intravenous or intramuscular injection of vitamin b21mg / kg, as for treatment of skin, eyes or inhalation exposure, due to low borate irritation, usually only rinse with water or move the patient to fresh air, but for skin multiple or large exposure, care should be taken the possibility of systemic poisoning.","sodium perborate is more alkaline and acts in the intestines with acid, which can be decomposed into borate (such as nabo2), boric acid and peroxide (such as hydrogen peroxide). as far as borate is not very toxic to human body, however, in the case of a large number of exposures, it can cause irritation to the human medullary areadores, causing spontaneous vomiting. in addition, borate can cause toxicity to the central nervous system and renal pelvis in a single large or repeated exposure, and may cause vitamins. b2 (riboflavin) is lacking.","['coma', 'peeling', 'exfoliative dermatitis', 'diarrhea', 'aphrodisiac', 'dizziness', 'corner arch reversal', 'disgusting', 'stunning']",['anemia'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hypersplenism,"hypersplenism (referred to as splenic spleen) is a syndrome of splenomegaly, cytopenia and myeloproliferation caused by different diseases. the clinical manifestations are splenomegaly, one or more kinds of blood cells are reduced, and bone marrow hematopoietic cells are correspondingly hyperplasia. can be relieved by splenectomy, after the treatment of the primary disease, the clinical symptoms of some cases can be alleviated, it is generally believed that hypersplenism is accompanied by varying degrees of spleen enlargement, this swollen spleen has a retention effect on blood cells, the proliferation of spleen sinus enhances the phagocytosis and destruction of blood cells, which is an important reason for the clinical manifestations of hypersplenism.after the spleen is removed, the clinical symptoms can be corrected. mainly due to splenomegaly and cytopenia and corresponding symptoms, the nature and size of the spleen vary according to the primary disease, to the late spleen can be significantly enlarged, blood cell reduction can lead to anemia, infection and bleeding, and some patients although white blood cells or the number of platelets is very low, but the signs and symptoms of infection or bleeding are not necessarily obvious or very mild.","actively prevent cirrhosis caused by various causes (especially schistosomiasis cirrhosis), chronic infections such as malaria, tuberculosis, malignant tumors such as lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelofibrosis and chronic hemolytic anemia and rare nets endothelial cell disease.","primary person refers to a series of manifestations of basic diseases that are not confirmed, but clinically have hypersplenism, also known as primary spleen hyperplasia, non-tropical idiopathic splenomegaly, primary splenic granulocyte reduction, primary spleen whole blood cell reduction, spleen anemia or splenic thrombocytopenia, due to unknown etiology, it is difficult to determine whether the disease is a different disease caused by the same cause or an independent disease that is not related to each other. secondary to the spleen, which affects the spleen due to diseases other than the spleen, leading to hypersplenism, most of the primary diseases have been diagnosed clearly, and more clinically seen secondary hypersplenism, including the following the cause is more clear: 1, acute infection with splenomegaly: such as viral hepatitis or infectious mononucleosis. 2, chronic infections: such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, malaria and so on. 3, congestive splenomegaly portal hypertension: intrahepatic obstructive such as portal cirrhosis, necrotizing cirrhosis, biliary cirrhosis, hemosiderosis, sarcoidosis, and extrahepatic obstructive there is external pressure or thrombosis of the portal vein or splenic vein, and so on. 4, inflammatory granuloma such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, felty syndrome and sarcoidosis. 5, malignant tumors such as lymphoma, leukemia and cancer metastasis. 6, chronic hemolytic diseases such as hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and marine anemia. 7, lipidoidosis such as gaucher disease and niemann-pick disease. 8, myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera, chronic myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis. 9, other: such as splenic aneurysm and cavernous hemangioma. regardless of primary or secondary splenomegaly, because the bone marrow compensatory hyperplasia is good, the peripheral blood picture does not show blood cell reduction, but once the infection or drugs and other factors inhibit the hematopoietic function, it can lead to single or whole blood cell cytoreduction. pathogenesis although the pathogenesis of hypersplenism still needs further investigation, according to the physiological functions of the spleen, there are several theories: 1. excessive retention: the blood vessels in the spleen are rich and the structure is special. the blood cells are in the sinusoids and the spleen and cords are retained for a long time. the sinus cells and the macrophages in the red pulp are rich in the blood cells filtered by them. , the performance of retention, under normal circumstances, most of the blood cells that are blocked are aging, congenital morphological abnormalities, abnormal hemoglobin structure, cells damaged by oxidized substances or encapsulated by antibodies, these blood cells are usually in the spleen the internal resistance is retained and destroyed. there is no red blood cell or white blood cell storage in the normal spleen, but about 1/3 of the platelets and some lymphocytes are retained in the spleen. when the spleen has pathologically significant swelling, not only more platelets 50% to 90%, and lymphocytes are retained in the spleen, and more than 30% of red blood cells are retained in the spleen, resulting in a decrease in platelets and red blood cells in the surrounding blood. 2, excessive screening and phagocytosis: spleen spleen mononuclear-macrophage system is overactive, while spleen cord abnormal red blood cells such as spherical cells and antibodies, oxidants or other chemical poisons, physical factors damaged red blood cells, etc. increased, and cleared by macrophages, resulting in a significant reduction in red blood cells in the surrounding blood, some erythrocyte membranes appear hydantoplasts, or there are gluten-like bodies in the pulp, and even the trophozoites of the malaria parasite. when the spleen enters the sinus, the common red blood cells are dilemma due to the inclusion of the hydantoplast or the giant-gel body in the small hole of the sinus base membrane, and finally the sinus wall macrophage is excavated, and the erythrocyte membrane is damaged. after repeated damage, the red blood cells become spherical cells, and eventually cannot be swallowed through the small pores of the basement membrane. 3, body fluid factors: some scholars have suggested that the spleen can produce certain secretin to inhibit the formation and maturation of bone marrow blood cells, and also inhibit the release of mature blood cells in the bone marrow. once the inhibitory factor is removed, the abnormal performance of bone marrow cells quickly returns to normal. it has been proved that: 1 spleen leachate can be injected into animals to reduce blood cells. 2 patients with spleen after the increased tolerance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, may be the result of removal of body fluid factors. 4. immune factors: it is considered that hypersplenism is a type of autoimmune disease. the spleen can produce antibodies, destroying its own blood cells, and reducing peripheral blood cells. the bone marrow has compensatory hyperplasia, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura. and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the spleen is the main place to produce antibodies, but also the place to destroy blood cells, when the spleen is removed, the blood and bone marrow often tend to improve. 5. dilution: when the spleen is enlarged, the total plasma volume is also significantly increased, which can dilute the blood and cause blood cells to decrease. the anemia is the result of the double action of pseudo-anemia caused by the retention and dilution of the spleen on blood cells. the enlarged spleen can correct the dilute anemia and restore normal plasma volume.","['bleeding tendency', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'granulocytopenia', 'spleen and kidney yang deficiency', 'thrombocytopenia', 'dizziness', 'nose yellow or brown', 'heart palpitations',

cardia cancer,"the incidence of cardiac cancer in high-risk areas of esophageal cancer in china is also very high. according to the statistics of these areas and cancer research institutions, the ratio of esophageal cancer to cardiac cancer is about 2:1.due to the inconsistent understanding of the scope of tuen mun, there are different views on the definition of cardia cancer, so that the statistics are larger and larger.the correct cardia cancer definition is an adenocarcinoma that occurs in the gastric cardia, which is about 50px below the esophagogastric line. it is a special type of gastric cancer and should be distinguished from the lower esophageal cancer. the etiology of cardia cancer is complex.it is generally believed that the living environment and diet are the two main carcinogenic factors of various cancers in the human digestive tract, and may also be related to gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal hiatus hernia. symptoms of cardia cancer include upper abdominal discomfort, mild postprandial fullness, indigestion, or pain in the heart and socket, etc., which are easily confused with the symptoms of peptic ulcer, which can not attract the attention of patients until the difficulty of swallowing is aggravated. the patient is seeking medical attention. the best treatment for cardiac cancer is the treatment of traditional chinese medicine with aldehyde.because cardia cancer is almost ineffective for radiation therapy, the effect of chemotherapy is not very satisfactory. therefore, the use of traditional chinese medicine for cardia cancer is widely used in clinic. traditional chinese medicine treatment can not only reduce the body weakness after surgery or chemotherapy, but also enhance the resistance.reduce the toxic side effects after chemotherapy.it can also prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis and serve the purpose of treating tumors.","there are many factors that induce cardia cancer, and it can effectively prevent cardia cancer. in daily life, we must pay attention to the following points: 1. no smoking or alcohol abuse. according to statistics, smoking is one of the main factors that induce cancer in the door. long-term smoking can directly induce the cardia. cancer, the relevant data show that the incidence of cardiac cancer in smokers is 10 times higher than that of non-smokers. in addition, alcohol is very irritating to the gastric mucosa, which may cause degeneration and necrosis of the surface of the cardia, and also contains nitrosamine, a variety of carcinogens, according to statistics, drinkers have a 10-fold higher incidence of cardia cancer than non-drinkers, and smokers and drinkers have a 30-fold higher incidence of cardia cancer than non-smoking and non-drinkers. 2, do not eat hot and hard food, the relevant experts in the high incidence of tuen mun cancer in henan province, yangzhong county, jiangsu province and other areas of the investigation showed that the occurrence of cardia cancer and diet overheating, hard, thick, fast, too hot tea, porridge can cause cancer of the gastric epithelium of the cardia. 3, do not eat mildew pickled food, mildew peanuts, mildew dried vegetables, cured meat, bacon and other foods are often contaminated by fungi such as aspergillus flavus, geotrichum candidum, easy to produce nitrosamines, nitrite and other carcinogens, prone to occur after consumption cardia cancer.","as with other tumors, the cause is unknown and may be related to dietary factors, environmental factors, genetic factors, and helicobacter pylori infection. pathogenesis 1, general classification (1) progression: gastrointestinal tumor classification generally follows borrman classification, the basic classification is scorpion, ulcer type i, ulcer type ii and invasive type, according to the author of this country divided into 4 types. 1 bulge type: the tumor is a lump with a clear edge to the cavity, which is cauliflower, nodular mass or polypoid, and may have shallow ulcer. 2 localized ulcer type: the tumor is a deep ulcer, and the edge tissue is like a ridge-like bulge, and the boundary between the cut surface and the normal tissue is clear. 3 infiltration ulcer type: the edge of the ulcer is not clear, the cut surface and the surrounding tissue are unclear. 4 infiltration type: the tumor infiltrates and grows in the wall of the cardia, the affected area is evenly thickened, and there is no boundary with the surrounding tissue, and the surrounding mucosa often shows radial contraction. gross type is related to histological type. types 1 and 2 are more highly differentiated adenocarcinomas and mucinous adenocarcinomas. invasive ulcers are more common in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and mucinous adenocarcinomas. invasive types are mostly poorly differentiated. diffuse adenocarcinoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma, surgical treatment prognosis with the best type of bulging, limited ulcer type second, invasive ulcer type is poor, invasive type is the worst. there are two main types of histological types of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma: adenocarcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma with obvious mucus secretion. these two types are divided into three subtypes of high differentiation, poor differentiation and diffuse according to the degree of differentiation. high and low are closely related to the prognosis of surgery. in addition to adenocarcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma, cardia cancer has some rare histological types, such as adenosquamous carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, carcinoid (sinusoidal cell carcinoma) and carcinosarcoma. (2) early stage: the general morphology of early cardiac cancer is similar to that of other parts of the stomach and early stage of esophagus, and can be easily divided into three types. 1 depression type: the mucosa of the cancerous tumor is irregularly mildly depressed, and a few are shallow ulcers. the boundary with the surrounding normal mucosa is not clear, and the differentiation under the microscope is often poor. 2 uplift type: the mucosa of the cancerous part is thick and rough, slightly bulging, and some of them are plaques, nodules or polyps, with a majority of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. 3 concealed type: the mucosa of the lesion is slightly darker in color, slightly thicker in texture, and there is no significant change in the body. it is diagnosed by histological examination and is the earliest form of type 3. 2, the spread and metastasis of cardia cancer (1) direct infiltration spread in the lower part of the stomach of the esophagus, the diaphragmatic muscle, left liver lobe, liver and stomach ligament, pancreatic tail, spleen, spleen and other retroperitoneal structures. (2) lymphatic metastasis: in the wall of the cardia, especially in the submucosa and subserosal layer, there are abundant lymphatic network and esophageal lymphatic network traffic, which are combined into extra-parenchymal lymphatic vessels, which are drained upward to the mediastinum and drained downward to the abdominal cavity. finally entering the thoracic duct, some authors suggested that the three lymphatic drainage systems of the cardia are: 1 litre of dry: along the esophageal wall up to the mediastinum. 2 right stem: from the small curvature of the stomach along the left ventricle of the stomach and the esophageal branch of the cardia to the celiac artery. 3 left stem: to the posterior wall along the large bend to the upper edge of the pancreas and retroperitoneum. it can also be divided into large curved branches, posterior gastric branches and sacral branches. there are lymph nodes along the system. the first station is next to the cardia (left and right), the lower esophagus and small curved lymph nodes, and the second station has left gastric vessels. next to the spleen and the omental lymph nodes, the distant side has the celiac artery, the abdominal aorta, the hilar region, the mediastinum and the supraclavicular lymph nodes.

pelvic floor syndrome,"sastic pelvic floor syndrome refers to a functional disease in which the pelvic floor muscles contract without loosening during forced bowel movements.the disease is more common in women, the ratio of male to female is about 1:2; there are symptoms such as difficulty in bowel movement, discomfort and pain; defecation is performed once every 2 to 3 days.may have bloating, blood in the stool and long-term constipation, the perineal nerve may be damaged at the same time; other secondary changes (such as intestinal fistula, visceral droop, etc.) may occur, and the rectal prolapse, rectal prolapse, mucosal relaxation or internal hemorrhoids and external hemorrhoids may occur. wait.","exercise properly and actively prevent constipation.all patients with pelvic floor syndrome should report to the hospital. it is best to follow up with the hospital for a long time. more importantly, the regular review in 2 is for early detection of malignant transformation, but sometimes there may be residual blister blocks. patients should take effective contraceptive measures for at least 2 years, and should be reviewed monthly for the first half of the year. if irregular vaginal bleeding, hemoptysis, headache or other discomfort occurs, they should go to the hospital immediately. in addition to asking whether menstruation is normal, you should also pay attention to the above symptoms.check should pay attention to whether the uterus is well-recovered. vaginal vulva has purple-blue nodular chest (preferably chest film) with shadows. the pregnancy test is very important in the follow-up, and about 60% of the moles are completely removed.if the patient is negative for more than 40 days after the pregnancy test is negative for 30 days, the patient should be highly suspected of malignant transformation or still have blister-like blocks. pregnancy test has been turned into a negative gynecological re-diagnosis, such as non-pregnancy should be highly suspected of malignant transformation, such as the original urine positive dilution test.the dilution test in the negative referral has turned positive again, especially those with increased dilution should also be highly suspected of malignant transformation.","etiology: thecause ofthis syndrome is not well understood and may be related to congenital anomalies, inflammation, and abuse of laxatives.this dysfunction is likely to be a normal muscle dysfunction, rather than a persistent paralysis of abnormal muscles, as both anal manometry and electromyography demonstrate that the function of the external sphincter is normal when the anus is still and tight.in some patients, the faecal colon has a delayed passage of time, and subtotal colectomy has no benefit. therefore, the delay in the smooth passage of patients with pelvic floor sputum condensate should be regarded as the retention of feces caused by export obstruction, instead of the power of the colon is declining. in 1993, stelzner found that persistent constipation in patients with pelvic floor syndrome was associated with increased sphincter activity.pelvic floor syndrome may also be associated with neurological dysfunction because pelvic floor syndrome can be treated by stimulation at the level of the receptor.the mechanism of action may be to depolarize the conductive tactile nerve fibers, especially the a汕 fibers, and the a汕 fibers produce presynaptic inhibition, inhibiting the transfer to the spinal motor neurons, thereby causing the muscles to produce relaxation.like all functional diseases, pelvic floor syndrome may be associated with psychological factors.","['bleeding blood', 'constipation']",['acne'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation biofeedback treatment', 'chinese medicine surgery treatment']"

ischemic colitis,"colonic ischemic disease due to insufficient blood flow perfusion or obstruction of the intestinal wall may account for nearly 50% of mesenteric ischemia.more common in the elderly over the age of 50, female patients are relatively common, occur in the left colon, especially in the intersection of arterial blood supply, such as the colon spleen and sigmoid colon.common causes: atherosclerotic stenosis, thrombosis, occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery or its branches, various causes of intestinal perfusion.uncommon causes are: hypercoagulable state, iatrogenic ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (such as during aortic surgery), embolism, vasculitis, and various causes of colonic obstruction.long-distance running, intra-abdominal inflammation or infectious diseases can sometimes induce the disease.non-gangrenous ischemic colitis accounts for 80%-85% of the total number of cases, and two-thirds of patients present with mild onset abdominal cramps, diarrhea, blood in the stool, abdominal pain and colonic ischemic lesions. the site is consistent, most of the symptoms are mild and short-lived, may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and some patients may have fever, weight loss and other performance.gangrenic ischemic colitis accounts for 15%-20% of the total number of cases. intestinal damage is serious, and it can develop into intestinal necrosis, perforation, and shock and acidosis. serious cases can be life-threatening.","for the prevention of this disease, middle-aged and elderly people should pay attention to regular living, avoid tobacco and alcohol, eat more vitamins and vegetables such as vegetables and fruits, try to avoid eating fat meat, animal internal organs and other high-fat foods. in addition, moderate participation should be taken. some indoor and outdoor sports within reach.","(1) causes of the disease 1. vascular anatomy and physiological coloration of the colon is mainly derived from the superior mesenteric artery, the inferior artery and the internal iliac artery, the artery of the right colon is from the superior mesenteric artery, the left colon and the upper part of the rectum are from the inferior mesenteric artery. the arterial blood in the middle and lower part of the rectum comes from the internal iliac artery. (1) superior mesenteric artery: originated in the anterior wall of the abdominal aorta about the first lumbar vertebrae, located 1.0 to 1.5 cm below the starting point of the celiac artery, which is passed through the lower edge of the pancreatic neck and longitudinally across the twelve rectum the transverse part enters the root of the small mesentery, and then the middle colon, the right colon and the ileal artery are separated, providing blood supply to the proximal transverse colon, ascending colon and ileocecal, respectively. the middle colon artery originates from the superior mesenteric artery at the lower edge of the pancreas and enters the transverse mesenteric membrane after the stomach. it is divided into two left and right branches. it is consistent with the ascending branch of the right colon artery near the hepatic collateral of the transverse colon. the riolan anastomosis is passed near the splenic flexion. the left colon artery is anastomosed, the anastomosis of the site is relatively small, and about 5% of the population is absent, making it the weakest part of the blood supply to the colon, prone to ischemic damage. in the normal population, there are about 20% of human colonic arteries are absent or stunted. the right colonic artery starts from the superior mesenteric artery 1 to 3 cm below the starting point of the middle cerebral artery, and goes diagonally to the right through the retroperitoneum. it is divided into ascending and descending branches near the ascending colon, respectively, with the right middle branch of the colon and the ileocolonic colon. the anastomosis forms the vascular arch at the edge of the colon and branches along the way to the ascending colon to supply the ascending colon. the ileal artery originates from the superior mesenteric artery below the starting point of the right colonic artery, and sometimes forms a trunk with the right colonic artery. it is obliquely descended to the right through the retroperitoneum, and is divided into upper and lower branches near the cecum, and the ascending branch and the right colon artery descending branch. the anastomosis, the reduction to the ileocecal part and the two branches with the superior mesenteric artery ileum anastomosis, supply the lower part of the ascending colon, the ileocecal and the end of the ileum. (2) inferior mesenteric artery: in the third lumbar vertebra, 3 to 5 cm below the horizontal part of the duodenum originates from the anterior wall of the abdominal aorta, and is arched obliquely to the left lower side. after 2 to 7 cm, the left colon artery is successively separated. and the sigmoid colon artery, and across the left common iliac artery, shifting behavior of the superior rectal artery. the left colonic artery is divided from 2.5 to 3.5 cm from the root of the inferior mesenteric artery. the ascending and descending branches are divided into the upper left and lower left through the retroperitoneum. the ascending branch is anastomosed to the left branch of the spleen and the middle cerebral artery. the descending branch and the sigmoid colon arterial anastomosis provides blood supply to the distal and descending colons of the transverse colon, respectively. the starting point of the sigmoid colon artery varies greatly. about 36% of the population originates directly from the inferior mesenteric artery, and 30% originates from the left colon artery. the number is also quite different, generally 2 to 6. the sigmoid colon is obliquely to the lower left through the peritoneum. the square enters the sigmoid mesenteric and conforms to each other to form an arterial vascular arch and an edge artery. the upper artery and the left colon artery form an anastomosis branch, which supplies the blood supply to the distal side of the descending colon. there is no between the lowermost part and the superior rectal artery. the borderline arteries connect and become another weak point in the blood supply to the colon, also known as the sudek point, which is prone to ischemic lesions. the superior rectal artery originates from the lower part of the sigmoid colon artery, and is divided into left and right posterior segments at the level of the second atlas. it supplies blood to most of the rectum. the blood supply to the lower rectum is mainly supplied by the middle and middle rectal arteries from the internal iliac artery. (3) peripheral arteries: each colonic artery is anastomosed near the intestinal wall, forming a plurality of continuous arterial arches parallel to the colon wall, called the marginal artery, also known as the drummond vascular arch, and the marginal artery is distributed from the ileocecal portion to the rectosigmoid colon. the junction is connected by a single artery or by a grade 1, 2 arterial arch, and a small terminal blood vessel is distributed from the vascular arch closest to the intestinal wall to the intestinal wall. these vascular arches have important clinical significance. in most cases, they constitute traffic between the various colonic arteries at different levels. when the trunk of a certain colonic artery is blocked, the colon in the blood supply area can pass. the vascular arch receives blood supply from other arterial trunks, and no ischemia occurs. however, if the occlusion occurs at the site of the vascular arch closest to the intestinal wall, the terminal artery supplying the intestinal wall is difficult to obtain blood supply through the collateral circulation. . (4) terminal arteries: small arteries that vary in length from the marginal artery to the intestinal wall. they are perpendicular to the colon and are responsible for supplying blood directly to the intestinal wall. there are two types of long and short branches in the terminal artery. after being separated from the marginal artery, it is divided into two branches at the mesenteric margin of the intestinal wall. the blood supply to the mesenteric 1/3 intestinal tube is supplied through the free edge between the serosa and the muscular layer to the intestinal wall. the terminal arteries have less anastomosis at the mesenteric margin of the intestine and at the margin of the mesentery, making the blood supply to the mesenteric margin of the colon susceptible to dysfunction; short branches from the long branch of the marginal artery or terminal artery, near the mesenteric margin penetrates into the intestinal wall and supplies 2/3 of the intestine of the mesenteric margin. the development and distribution of the terminal arteries are dense in the left colon. the right colon is relatively rare, and the distance from the marginal artery to the intestinal wall is also relatively high. long, these terminal arteries are very sensitive to vasoconstrictors, and there are few collateral circulations between them. for the above reasons, when a long time of vasoconstriction occurs, it is difficult to obtain sufficient blood supply to the intestinal wall, which is prone to ischemia. this is more pronounced in the right colon. there are vascular plexuses in the whole layer of the colorectal wall, but the vascular plexus of the mucosa and submucosa is the most abundant. the blood vessels supplying the mucosa gland are derived from the submucosal vascular plexus. when the blood flow of the terminal artery is reduced by shock or hypotension, arteriovenous shunt occurs in the intestinal wall, causing ischemia of the mucosa. the degree of ischemia depends on the collateral circulation of the intestinal wall and the location of vascular occlusion. when the vascular occlusion occurs at the root of the larger colonic artery, the edge of the vascular arch is passed. the collateral circulation, the colon in the relevant area does not necessarily have ischemia, but if accompanied by abnormal development of the marginal vascular arch, segmental intestinal ischemia or even necrosis occurs in the blood supply area, and the arterial occlusion is closer to the intestine wall, the more likely to cause blood supply disorders of the intestinal wall, it has been reported that a long-branch vessel damage can cause the intestinal tube to necrosis about 2.5cm. (5) venous: the venous plexus in the colon wall is pooled into small veins, which are synthesized into larger veins at the mesenteric margin. parallel to the colonic artery, it becomes the vein accompanying the colonic artery, the colonic vein, the right colon vein and the ileum. intravenous synthesis of the superior mesenteric vein, into the portal vein, sigmoid colon vein, left colon vein and superior rectal vein synthesis of the inferior mesenteric vein, in the lateral direction of the inferior mesenteric artery, to the outside of the duodenal jejunum, through the back of the pancreas into the splenic vein, the final entry vein . 2. etiology and pathogenesis cause colonic ischemia for many reasons, which can be roughly divided into two categories, one is vascular obstruction type, and the other is non-vascular obstruction type. (1) vascular obstructive colonic ischemia: in vascular obstructive colonic ischemia, the most common causes are trauma of mesenteric artery, mesenteric vascular thrombosis or embolism, and ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery during abdominal aortic reconstruction or colon surgery. . in the case of blunt abdominal injury, if the mesenteric vessels are damaged and thrombosis or retroperitoneal hematoma is formed, it may cause colonic ischemia. patients are often accompanied by extensive internal organs, limbs, cardiopulmonary and nervous system damage. dauterive et al. of the patients with abdominal blunt trauma, 41 were associated with intestinal ischemic lesions. abdominal aortic angiography can induce thrombosis in the mesenteric artery, causing ischemic enteritis, but the incidence is relatively low, which may be caused by the stimulation of the inner wall of the blood vessel by the contrast agent or the damage of the blood vessel by the catheter during the examination. a atherosclerotic shedding, or a left atrial embolus from a patient with atrial fibrillation, can also cause obstruction of the mesenteric artery, if only the inferior mesenteric artery is obstructed without collateral dysfunction, progressive emboli and obstruction of the superior mesenteric artery root, due to the presence of the marginal vascular arch, the affected part of the colon can obtain blood supply through the collateral circulation, generally does not occur colonic ischemia, if the patient's colonic vascular arch congenital dysplasia or bilateral sacral if the artery is obstructed, the simple inferior mesenteric artery occlusion can also cause colonic infarction. williams reported that the severity and survival rate of the disease are not directly related to the obstruction of the inferior mesenteric artery. the survival rate of the obstruction group is 65%, non-obstruction. the group was 60%, so the obstruction of the simple aorta did not seem to affect the clinical manifestations and prognosis of the disease. in recent years, ischemic colitis associated with abdominal aortic surgery has attracted more and more attention. bjorck et al. followed up 415 patients with abdominal aortic surgery and found that the incidence of ischemic colitis was 2.6. %, if there is shock during the operation, the incidence rate can reach 7.3%, the incidence rate after emergency surgery is significantly higher than the elective surgery, which occurs on the one hand related to intraoperative ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery in the root, on the other hand may also other factors are related, such as the degree of openness of the internal iliac artery of the patient, the time of interruption of the intra-aortic aorta, the location of the inferior mesenteric artery, the degree of opening of the colonic vascular arch, the degree of arteriosclerosis, the time of hypotension, and the state of cardiac function. whether accompanied by small blood vessel disease and so on. more important than the obstruction of the inferior mesenteric artery is the obstruction of the surrounding small arteries, especially in young patients, which causes many causes of small arterial occlusion, including diabetes, vasculitis, systemic collagen disease, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, and knots. segmental polyarteritis, allergic granulomatosis, behcet syndrome, buerger's disease, application of certain drugs, aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease, lymphoma, leukemia and tumor chemotherapy can also cause ischemic enteritis . colonic ischemia caused by venous return obstruction and venous thrombosis often occurs in the right colon. studies have shown that venous obstruction can cause edema, infarction and fibrosis of the intestinal wall. common causes are portal hypertension, pancreatitis with pancreatic abscess. and pancreatic pseudocysts, as well as long-term oral contraceptives, the mortality rate of pancreatitis with colon necrosis can reach about 50%. the blood supply to the colon wall is affected by the diameter of the intestine, the muscle tension in the intestinal wall, and the pressure in the intestinal lumen. saegesser reports that as the pressure in the intestinal lumen increases, the blood flow in the intestinal wall decreases, and the difference in arteriovenous oxygen content in the intestinal wall is also reduced, at this time, the degree of intestinal mucosal ischemia is more obvious than the serosa layer, colonic expansion causes colonic ischemia, and colonic ischemia will further lead to colonic expansion, thus forming a vicious circle, in the case of intestinal obstruction, if the ileocecal valve good function, almost all cecal perforation is caused by intestinal wall ischemia and necrosis. in addition to the effects of obstruction time, obstruction site, ileocecal valve closure function and degree of intestinal dilatation, tissue perfusion is insufficient due to various reasons. such as shock, dehydration, acidosis, myocardial failure, etc. can also aggravate intestinal ischemia caused by colonic obstruction. (2) non-vascular obstructive colonic ischemia: mostly spontaneous, usually without obvious vascular occlusion, it is difficult to find a clear cause of colonic ischemia in the clinic. most of the patients are elderly, and colonic deficiency occurs. after blood changes, vascular abnormalities revealed by mesenteric angiography may not be consistent with clinical symptoms. spontaneous colonic ischemia can be induced for a variety of reasons, including hypotension, which is most common in various causes, such as septic shock, cardiogenic shock, anaphylactic shock, neurological shock, etc., accompanied by heart disease, hypertension diabetes and taking drugs that affect visceral blood flow (such as booster drugs) can significantly increase the chance of colonic ischemia, reduce mesenteric blood supply, and cause colonic ischemia; and a wide range of acute mesenteric blood supply disorders causes significant irreversible cardiac output reduction, thus leading to a vicious circle of mesenteric ischemia. (b) the pathogenesis 1. pathological classification ischemic colitis can be divided into vascular obstruction according to the cause; bald scorpion 恶u j Xq Xq Xq Xq rJ rJ rJ A A 翔 翔 翔 翔 翔 翔 w w w w w wtwo types of ischemic colitis and non-gangrene, of which non-gangrene can be divided into transient reversible and chronic irreversible. 2. ischemic colitis of thepredilection sitecan occur in any part of the examination, but the incidence of left colon in the lower mesenteric artery is the highest. saegesser reports 112 cases, of which 37 cases are located in the descending colon and 33 cases are located in the colon spleen. qu, 24 cases in the sigmoid colon, the right semi-colon with less distribution of terminal arteries is also a common predilection site. individual lesions can affect the whole colon, and the location of the lesion is also related to the cause of ischemia. ischemic lesions of blood pressure occur mostly in the right colon, especially in the posterior wall of the colon, and in patients with abdominal aortic surgery, the lesions are mostly located in the left colon. 3. pathological changes (1) reversible colonic ischemia: most of the only involving the mucosa and submucosa, the lesions are relatively light, no obvious tissue necrosis, visible thickening of the intestinal wall, mucosal edema, cobblestone-like changes, accompanied by mucosa linear ulcers and hemorrhage, severe mucosal ulcers can be seen in severe cases, but there is little ischemic change in the mucosal muscle layer, the serosa layer is normal, and some patients may have mucosal shedding before tissue repair. the typical histological manifestations are chronic submucosal inflammatory cell infiltration and granulation tissue formation. visible mucosal islands can be seen between widely existing ulcers. granulous tissue and inflammatory cells can be seen in the mucosal bed of the mucosal exfoliation site, sometimes small arteritis and fibrin emboli can be seen in the submucosal artery. capillary hyperplasia, fibroblasts and macrophages can be seen in the epithelial regeneration site. eosinophils and hemoglobin-containing tissue cells can be found around the granulation tissue. infiltration, the presence of these hemoglobin-containing macrophages suggests the occurrence of hemorrhagic intestinal infarction, which can be used to differentiate between ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease. in addition, in ischemic colitis, about 80% of mucosa the lamina propria is hyaline-like and can be distinguished from pseudomembranous colitis. (2) gangrene type: typical pathological manifestations are tissue necrosis of varying degrees in the lesions. in mild cases, intestinal lumen dilatation, mucosal hemorrhage, weak and thin intestinal wall, and depth and range can be seen. mucosal ulcers and necrosis, the intestinal lumen is filled with blood, and the pathological changes of the naked eye are similar to fulminant ulcerative colitis. during the vascular regeneration period, the intestinal wall becomes thicker, and if the ischemic changes in the whole layer of the intestinal wall can cause intestinal stenosis, if the ischemia is light, only the pathological changes of the mucosa can be made, and the serosa layer is normal. in severe cases, the intestinal wall is black or green, the intestinal wall tissue is dissolved and thinned, the intestinal mucosa is shed, the muscle layer is exposed, and some patients have muscle layer. necrosis and shedding, perforation of the intestinal wall. histological examination showed mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage, edema, and the surface layer of the intestinal gland first changed. the glandular tube was filled with inflammatory cells and red blood cells. the mucosal surface was covered with fibrin and necrotic tissue. the pathological changes of pseudomembranous colitis were sometimes difficult. the difference is that early lesions have a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration, followed by mucosal shedding, forming irregular necrotizing ulcers, typical fibrin emboli can be seen in the mucosa of the mucosa and submucosa, and gram staining shows bacterial invasion under the mucosa. in patients with severe ischemic enteritis, normal tissue has rarely survived, and only necrotic mucosal and submucosal tissues are revealed. (3) chronic stenosis: the tissue structure is replaced by fibrous tissue in the process of chronic inflammation, and tubular stenosis is formed locally. the obstruction caused by stenosis is generally incomplete, the distance is relatively short, and it is most common in the sigmoid colon. the stenosis caused by disease and crohn's disease is difficult to identify. the typical manifestation of histological examination is that the annular mucosa disappears. the ulcer area is covered by granulation tissue and newborn capillaries. the edge of the ulcer is accompanied by epithelial regeneration, and the mucosal muscle layer is distorted. with extensive fibrosis, submucosa filled with granulation tissue, fibroblasts, plasma cells, eosinophils, and chronic inflammatory cells, scattered inflammatory changes in the serosal surface of the intestinal wall and fat around the colon.","['shock', 'grand jue silver', 'entertaining', 'colon inflated', 'blood blood', 'peripheral irritation', 'abdominal pain', 'disgusting', 'colon obstruction', 'peritonitis']","['hypertension', 'arteriosclerosis', 'heart disease', 'shock', 'intestinal obstruction', 'paralytic ileus', 'shock']","['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

dumping syndrome,"dumping syndrome refers to the loss of the pylorus or its normal function after gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy due to surgery. the food in the stomach suddenly falls to the duodenum or jejunum, which can cause a series of symptoms that can occur in any type of stomach. after the operation, it is more common after the billroth ii type gastric resection. the vagus nerve injury caused by esophageal surgery can also cause dumping symptoms.after gastrectomy, the patient lost the pyloric regulation function, the volume of the residual stomach was reduced, and the vagus nerve resection affected the relaxation of the stomach after the meal, so that a large number of hypertonic chyme suddenly poured into the duodenum or jejunum after eating.the hyperosmolar sugar in the intestine and the extracellular fluid in the intestinal wall are rapidly exchanged to maintain the balance of the osmotic pressure between the intestinal cavity and the intestinal wall, and cause a significant increase in blood glucose and a decrease in blood volume in a short period of time. up to a quarter of the fluid with an effective circulating blood volume can penetrate into the intestinal lumen, causing the blood to concentrate, causing symptoms such as pulse acceleration and collapse.","the method of prevention should be that the gastric resection should not be excessive during surgery, the residual stomach should not be too small, the anastomosis should be moderately sized, generally suitable for 4cm width. if there is symptoms after eating, it should be supine, try to eat high-nutrition and digestible solids. food, eat less and eat more, and avoid too sweet, too salty, too concentrated diet and dairy products, drinking water and liquid food can be taken between meals, not at mealtimes, most patients with post-prandial symptom group after surgery are mild. after a period of gastrointestinal adaptation and dietary adjustment, the symptoms can disappear or be easily controlled.the control of dietary ingredients and eating meals is the most important part of all treatments. dietary intake should be low-sugar, high-protein, high-fat foods.","after gastrectomy, the patient lost the pyloric regulation function, the volume of the residual stomach was reduced, and the vagus nerve resection affected the relaxation of the stomach after the meal, so that a large number of hypertonic chyme suddenly poured into the duodenum or jejunum after eating. the hyperosmolar sugar in the intestine and the extracellular fluid in the intestinal wall are rapidly exchanged to maintain the balance of the osmotic pressure between the intestinal cavity and the intestinal wall, and cause a significant increase in blood glucose and a decrease in blood volume in a short period of time. up to a quarter of the fluid with an effective circulating blood volume can penetrate into the intestinal lumen, causing the blood to concentrate, causing symptoms such as pulse acceleration and collapse. the accumulation of up to a thousand milliliters of fluid in the intestine will cause the intestine to swell, accelerate peristalsis and emptying, causing colic and diarrhea. (1) vasorine-bradykinin: patients with gastric resection have a rise in serum tachykinin in patients with dumping syndrome, and no patients with no dumping syndrome. intravenous bradykinin production in normal subjects and dumping syndrome are closely related to the level of bradykinin in the blood. angione can increase peripheral blood flow and capillary permeability, and can increase gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction, which can lead to vasodilation and gastrointestinal symptoms. therefore, it is believed that the occurrence of intrinsic symptoms is related to the activity of the vasopressin-bradykinin system. (2) vasoactive intestinal peptide: the blood vasoactive intestinal peptide was significantly increased in patients after gastrectomy, and the increase in concurrent dumping syndrome was particularly significant. the intravenous input of vasoactive intestinal peptide to normal people may have similar dumping syndrome. symptom. in addition, gastric atrophin, motilin, serotonin, substance p, etc. have also been considered to be related to the occurrence of this disease, but there is no conclusion yet. clinical observations have shown that the preoperative mental state of the patient is excitatory or stress-type, and the dumping syndrome is more likely to occur after surgery. psycho-neural factors can cause pyloric regulation of dysfunction and accelerate gastric emptying, and even dumping syndrome can occur in patients who have not undergone gastrectomy. pathogenesis the mechanism of symptoms is generally believed to be: 1. a large amount of food directly enters the small intestine to expand and expand the intestine. hypertonic food in the small intestine absorbs a large amount of body fluid from the intestinal wall and also expands and expands the intestine. 2. the expansion of the intestine can cause a reflex response of the autonomic nerve, so that the intestinal wall releases serotonin, bradykinin, substance p, and other intestinal vasoactive intestinal peptides, which leads to increased intestinal peristalsis and vasodilation. the latter causes a decrease in blood pressure and a cyclical symptom such as an increase in heart rate. 3. infiltration of extracellular fluid into the intestine can cause a decrease in effective circulating blood volume, a decrease in serum k, aggravation of the symptoms of the circulatory system, and a faster emptying of the food during the standing position. the above symptoms are more pronounced. in short, the postprandial symptom group it is a comprehensive response of the above three factors.","['blood pressure drop', 'gut sound', 'post-meal hypoglycemia', 'diarrhea', 'postprandial syndrome', 'dumping syndrome', 'tachycardia', 'dizziness', 'belch']",['hypoglycemia'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
umbilical bulging - giant tongue - giant somatic syndrome,"umbilical bulge - exomphalosmacro-glossia-gigantism syndrome is also known as neonatal hypoglycemia - giant tongue - visceral hypertrophy - umbilical bulging syndrome, neonatal hypoglycemia with visceral hypertrophy - giant tongue - cerebellar syndrome, congenital hereditary disease is an autosomal recessive inheritance.often occurs in the offspring of close relatives.in 1963, beckwith first described the intrinsic, so it was called beckwith syndrome. in 1964, weidemann reported that the disease occurred in a three siblings.therefore, it is also known as beckwith-weidemann syndrome.the pathogenesis of this disease has not been fully understood. it has been determined that the plasma insulin concentration of 4 children has been significantly elevated. it is believed that the proliferation of islet 汕 cells secreting function and then producing hyperinsulinemia is the basis of hypoglycemia.some people think that the function of islet 汐 cells is relatively insufficient, and the disorder of glycogen decomposition may also be the cause of hypoglycemia.",regular abdominal ultrasound examination during pregnancy can be used to detect umbilical bulge early so that treatment can be taken immediately after delivery.,"the etiology of this disease is unclear. it is a congenital hereditary disease. it is an autosomal recessive inheritance. it often occurs in the offspring of close relatives. the pathogenesis of this disease is not yet clear. some people measured the plasma insulin concentration in 4 children and found that they are obvious. elevated, it is believed that the proliferation of pancreatic islet 汕-cells and the production of hyperinsulinemia are the basis of hypoglycemia. some people believe that islet 汐-cell function is relatively insufficient, and glycogenolysis may also be the cause of hypoglycemia.","['cryptordema', 'mega tongue', 'small head', 'twitching', 'curious hypertrophy', 'loss of consciousness', 'diaphragmatic defect', 'wasting']",['hepatoblastoma'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
lead poisoning,"lead and its compounds are toxic to all tissues of the human body. the poisoning route can be inhaled by the respiratory tract by its vapor or dust, and then the phagocytic cells in the respiratory tract can be quickly brought to the blood; or absorbed through the digestive tract and enter the blood circulation to cause poisoning.poisoners generally have a history of exposure to lead and lead.oral administration of 2-3 grams can cause poisoning, 50 grams can be fatal.clinical lead poisoning is rare.","1. develop good hygiene habits, especially pay attention to washing hands before meals, and do not put foreign objects in the mouth. 2. when the food bag is filled with food, prevent the words, paintings or trademarks on the plastic bag from coming into direct contact with food, especially acidic food. 3, avoid the use of pottery or porcelain painted inside the pattern to hold food. 4. do not paint the walls in your home. the paint contains a lot of lead, which causes lead pollution in the living room. 5. don't carry infants and toddlers to play near the road where cars travel more and more, because the exhaust gas from cars often contains a lot of lead. 6, do not eat foods with higher lead, such as pine eggs, canned food. 7, vegetables and fruits should be washed before eating, peeling and peeling, in order to prevent lead in pesticide residues. 8. when the faucet is turned on for the first time every day, do not drink the water that flows out. 9, pay attention to diet balance, especially rich in calcium, zinc, iron, vitamin b, etc., is beneficial to reduce the load and harm of lead in the body. 10, if you are exposed to lead at work, you should wear protective clothing, take a bath after work, put on clean clothes and go home, so as not to bring lead dust home. 11. try to eat more high-fiber foods. oats, brown rice, wheat bran and vegetables are rich in cellulose. add more fruits and kelp rich in pectin and seaweed. (note: when taking supplemental fiber, it should be taken separately from other supplements and drugs.) 12. the ideal daily meal should include more than 3-5 kinds of vegetables and 2-3 kinds of fruits. try to eat fruits rich in fruit acids, vitamin c and bioflavonoids, such as thorn pear, sea buckthorn, kiwi and so on. they help antagonize lead damage and remove lead from the body. 13. drink high-protein drinks or supplement essential amino acids such as milk and soy milk. because the lack of amino acids affects other functions. 14. increase the intake of manganese by eating pecans, barley, buckwheat, whole wheat, and dried peas. manganese-rich foods provide important chelating agents and prevent lead and calcium from entering arterial epithelial cells. 15. the daily recipe should contain onions and garlic. they produce natural chelation in the body and help remove lead from the body. 16, eat more foods rich in sulfur, such as garlic, onions and beans, but pay attention to zinc can inhibit the role of sulfur. 17, should pay attention to supplement b vitamins. this is important because chelating agents can be excreted in combination with certain vitamins. 18. pay attention to the necessary minerals during the use of chelating agents, especially zinc and chromium, because the use of chelating agents will reduce the minerals in the body. it is recommended to use sputum, kelp, iron supplement and zinc supplement to supplement. 19. for lead inspection of talcum powder, add a little acetic acid, and then add 1% potassium iodide solution. if golden yellow appears, it is lead.","causes of the disease: environmental pollution (35%): 1. in the atmosphere, it mainly refers to lead emissions from industrial production, life and transportation. lead poisoning is caused by unavoidable industrial waste gas, leaded gasoline, automobile exhaust, coal burning, steel metallurgy, and chemical plant emissions. 2. in soil and dust, in general, the soil contains lead 10~50mg/kg, but in urban areas, the lead content in the soil may be hundreds or even thousands of times higher. indoor lead dust is also an important source of lead exposure in children. 3. in the water, wastewater contaminated drinking water can cause an increase in lead content in the water. studies have shown that children's absorption rate of lead can be as high as 50% or more. ingestion of excessive lead-containing drugs (20%): black tin, medusa, etc., can cause acute poisoning. lead poison can also be absorbed by the respiratory tract, such as lead-containing talcum powder (which can be inhaled by infants). the lead-containing soot generated by burning the battery can cause inhalation poisoning in infants and young children. children living in the environment with lead dust around can often inhale a certain amount of lead workers in the work clothes for a long time to bring home pollution dust, so that their children often inhaled dust containing lead poison and symptomatic lead poisoning . others (20%): lead-leading industries include: lead mining, printing and casting, casting, shipbuilding, welding, and production of batteries, cables, paints, ceramics, glazes, leaded glass, bullets, medicine, plastic stabilizers, etc. in the production process, lead pollutes the air in the form of dust or smoke. the emphysema of the car contains lead, and a large amount of emissions can pollute the atmosphere. in daily life, the use of lead-containing containers to store food, beverages, and excessive lead-containing drugs such as hydrazine, black tin, etc. may cause accidental lead poisoning. pathophysiology 1. absorption, distribution and discharge of lead normal people enter 300米g of lead daily from the diet, about 10% of which can be absorbed. about 40% of the lead inhaled by the respiratory tract can be absorbed. after the lead is absorbed, it enters the blood and is distributed in soft tissues such as liver, spleen, kidney, brain, etc. after that, lead is redistributed in the body. 90%-95% of the lead is stored in the bones. the lead absorbed into the body is mainly excreted by the kidneys, and a small part is excreted by feces, saliva, sweat, milk, etc., and the daily lead absorption exceeds 0. 5mg can accumulate and become toxic. lead in blood and soft tissues is transportable lead, which is biologically active. its amount exceeds normal, but it is lead absorption when there is no poisoning symptom. excess lead can cause toxicity. lead in bone is stored as lead, no biological activity, blood lead, soft tissue lead and bone lead are in a state of dynamic equilibrium. in the case of infection, drinking, acidosis, etc., lead transport in the bone to the blood and soft tissue can cause poisoning. 2. poisoning mechanism the toxicity of lead and its inorganic compounds is related to the amount of lead in the body. lead compounds with small particles are easily inhaled by the respiratory tract. lead compounds with high solubility are easily absorbed into the body, so they are more toxic, and lead is easy to protein with in the body. the combination of thiol groups inhibits thiol-containing enzymes, particularly those involved in heme synthesis. lead inhibits erythrocyte delta-汐-amino-r-ketovalerate dehydratase (alad), which increases serum and urinary 汛-amino-r-ketovaleric acid (ala), and lead inhibits coproporphyrinogen decarboxylase, causing urine in the feces. increased porphyrin, lead inhibits heme synthase, interferes with the binding of iron to protoporphyrin to heme, and affects hemoglobin production, resulting in accumulation of iron (forming ring-shaped iron granules) and free protoporphyrin (fep) in young red blood cells the free protoporphyrin is chelated with zinc to form zinc protoporphyrin (zpp). lead poisoning can increase the number of rainbow cells, which is because lead inhibits erythrocyte pyrimidine-5-nucleotide plum, which causes the degradation of pyrimidine nucleotides in erythrocytes, and also hinders the degradation of ribosomal rna. degraded pyrimidine nucleotides and ribosomal rna form basophilic spots. lead is attached to the erythrocyte membrane, interfering with na+, k+atpase, and making red blood cells fragile and easy to hemolyze. in recent years, ala has been found to pass the blood-brain barrier. a large amount of ala entering the brain tissue during lead poisoning can cause various behavioral and neurological effects. the mechanism may be that ala is similar in structure to r-aminobutyric acid (gaba) and can compete with gaba for postsynaptic membrane. the gaba receptor affects the function of gaba. some aspects of the pathogenesis of lead poisoning have not yet been elucidated.","['the face is gray', 'the wrist is drooping at

believed that due to certain factors, the integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa is destroyed, food and other antigens enter the tissue, mast cells are sensitized and degranulated, and histamine eosinophil chemotactic factors are released. acidic granulocyte infiltration and degranulation, resulting in tissue damage, the release of eosinophilic peroxidase further stimulates mast cells to release histamine, forming a vicious circle, except for type i allergic reactions, abnormal immune function in eosinophils the incidence of gastroenteritis plays an important role, but no consistent immune dysfunction has been found. it is suggested that eosinophilic gastroenteritis is digestive. specific inflammation, allergic reactions such eosinophilic inflammation is caused by some unknown antigens, as crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis part, amoebic dysentery, milk protein colitis reaction. it has been reported that eosinophilic enteritis has a genetic predisposition, and there is no final conclusion because of no familial investigation. the affected parts can be from the esophagus to the rectum, and the small intestine and stomach are most common. the histological features are a large number of eosinophil infiltration, which can be aggregated into a heap. eosinophil infiltration can affect the whole gastrointestinal wall, or a certain one layer is mainly affected, the most common are mucosa and submucosa, followed by muscle layer, serosal layer is rare, other pathological changes include edema, small intestine villi atrophy, mucosal and glandular epithelial cell necrosis and regeneration, eosinophil infiltration can be seen in any inflammatory process, while other inflammatory cells are significantly increased, should be noted to identify with it. ureless classification: type i: extensive eosinophilic invasive gastritis (referred to as eosinophilic gastroenteritis), including polyenteric, monoenteric, and regional. type ii: localized eosinophilic invasive granuloma (referred to as eosinophilic granuloma), including regional, polypoid. the disease can be extensively involved in the gastrointestinal tract, from the pharynx to the rectum. among them, the stomach and small intestine are most common, and the liver and the omentum can be invaded. a large amount of eosinophil infiltration can be seen under the microscope, which can be piled up. may be involved in the mucosa and submucosa, but also a layer of involvement, the most common is the mucosa and submucosa, followed by the muscle layer, the serosa layer is the least seen. type i (eosinophilic gastroenteritis): a characteristic type of gastroenteritis, fiber gastroscopy, diffuse type of mucosal congestion, edema, thickening, occasionally superficial ulcer erosion, stomach lesions resemble general superficial gastritis, biopsy confirmed a large number of eosinophilic infiltration, intestinal lesions are mostly diffuse, affected intestinal wall edema, thickening, serosal surface tarnish, covered with cellulose exudate, single intestinal table is mostly stomach or small intestine a certain organ lesion, localized lesions, localized in the stomach, lesions often in the stomach pylorus or antrum, multiple intestinal, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, etc. have lesions, often extensive sexual, non-continuous lesions. according to the degree of eosinophilic infiltration, kleim divides the lesion into three types: 1. prominent mucosal lesions: mainly mucosal infiltration, mucosal edema, ulceration, and blood loss, iron deficiency, malabsorption and low protein. 2. prominence of myometrial lesions: mainly myometrial invasion, nodular thickening of the gastrointestinal wall, and bulging into the gastrointestinal tract, leading to stenosis or obstruction of the pylorus or intestine, clinically required to type ii ( identification of eosinophilic granuloma. 3. serosal lesions prominent: mainly serosal infiltration, thickening of the serosa, edema, often involving mesenteric lymph nodes, and more eosinophilic (or eosinophils) ascites. type ii (eosinophilic granuloma): this type is rare.single or multiple tumors can be formed under the mucosa, often with pyloric obstruction.the stomach (stomach sinus) is the most common.and spread to the surrounding growth, invading the ileum, colon.it is a solid or rubbery polypoid mass, pedunculated or pedicled into the cavity, with a smooth surface and mucous membrane coverage.eosinophilic granulation is most common in the stomach (53%), followed by the colon, rectum (28%), and small intestine (16%).","['nausea and vomiting', 'incremental absorption of water in the intestines', 'abdominal pain', 'diarrhea']",['ascites'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal

neuropathic vomiting,"neuropathic vomiting, also known as psychogenic vomiting or functional vomiting, refers to a group of mental and psychological disorders that spontaneously or deliberately induce repeated vomiting.neuropathic vomiting does not affect the appetite of the next meal. it is often associated with unpleasant mood, psychological stress, and inner conflict. the disease generally has no other symptoms, no basis for organic disease, but may have the idea of being afraid of getting fat and losing weight, but because of the total the amount of food intake is not reduced, so the weight is not significantly reduced.this disease is more common in women, usually in the early and middle stages of adulthood. some patients have hysterical personality, which is characterized by self-centeredness, good performance, and cues.","the prevention of neurological vomiting mainly depends on the psychological factors of finding and solving bad drugs, and the symptomatic treatment of drugs is less effective.children should be reasonably arranged to live, including diet, exercise and physical sleep.people around you should not pay too much attention to the child's vomiting symptoms, and should avoid showing nervousness and concern in front of the child to improve their confidence in treatment.severe children may have repeated vomiting, causing malnutrition, physical weakness, and even water and dielectric disturbances.therefore, we must pay attention to the systemic nutritional status of children with neurological vomiting and maintain the balance of water and electricity.in addition, low-dose chlorpromazine can achieve sedative vomiting.","1. emotional confusion caused by various factors, such as sudden separation from parents, strong stimulation, death of relatives, etc. 2. responding to thoughts and experiences that are unpleasant or abhorrent, such as a girl who goes to school to meet a behavior that causes brains to smash out due to a car accident, and then vomits when she sees the tofu food. 3. excessive mental stress, such as encountering various types of examinations, especially some girls, showing particularly nervous, and often have a history of past attacks. 4. as a means of opposing parents, when children are over-stimulated or when parents force their children to do things they are not willing to do, some children may vomit to object. 5. as a means of exerting pressure on the family, some parents, who love and indulge their children, sometimes use vomiting to put pressure on their parents, such as children who are afraid of going to school or attending kindergarten, vomiting often occurs in the morning, and weekends. or vomiting does not occur on holidays; if the mother forces the child to eat or overfeed, the child can also vomit to resist.","['disgusting', 'tension']",['malnutrition'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['psychological treatment', 'drug treatment']"
esophageal cancer,"esophageal cancer is a malignant tumor that occurs in the esophageal epithelium, accounting for 2% of all malignancies.about 200,000 people die of esophageal cancer every year in the world. china is a high-risk area for esophageal cancer. the death of esophageal cancer is second only to that of gastric cancer. the age of onset is more than 40 years old. men are more than women, but in recent years, there is a growing trend among people under the age of 40.the occurrence of esophageal cancer is related to chronic nitrosamine stimulation, inflammation and trauma, genetic factors, and trace element content in drinking water, food and vegetables.but the exact reason is not clear and needs to be studied. esophageal cancer often has no obvious symptoms in the early stage, and occasionally manifests as painful discomfort after the sternum.as the tumor enlarges, the patient may experience swallowing discomfort or foreign body sensation while eating.often expressed as a slower eating speed and often need soup to deliver rice.after several months, because the tumor is further enlarged and the esophageal lumen is blocked, the patient can only eat fluid. when the tumor completely blocks the lumen, the patient appears to be ""difficult to drip.""","1. primary prevention primary prevention, ie etiology prevention, is the fundamental way to reduce the incidence of esophageal cancer. it is closely related to the progress of epidemiological research and etiology research. this is the most ideal method, but it is very difficult. it is still difficult to carry out in full. (1) changing the habit of eating mildew food: there is sufficient evidence to show that the consumption of mildew food, especially sauerkraut, moldworm and fish sauce, is one of the important factors in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer. therefore, it is necessary to vigorously promote such food pairs. the harm of human health makes the people eat less or not, and encourages the cultivation of vegetables and fruits to increase the intake of fresh vegetables and fruits and to supplement vitamin c. mildew foods, on the one hand, produce mycotoxins or metabolites, on the one hand promote the internal synthesis of nitrosamines, which is the main cause of esophageal cancer. eating more fresh vegetables or supplementing vitamin c can block the synthesis of nitrosamines in the body. it can reduce the content of nitrosamines in the stomach, thereby reducing the exposure level of nitrosamines in the stomach. in addition, lin county's nutritional prevention test found that supplementation of riboflavin and niacin can reduce the incidence of esophageal cancer by 15%. at the same time, we should actively study scientific methods for making and preserving sauerkraut to meet the traditional eating habits that have been developed by local residents since generations. change bad eating habits, don't eat moldy food, eat less or not eat sauerkraut. improve water quality and reduce nitrite content in drinking water. promote trace element fertilizers and correct the trace elements such as molybdenum deficiency in soil. the application of chinese and western medicine and vitamin b2 in the treatment of esophageal epithelial hyperplasia to block the process of cancer. active treatment of esophagitis, esophageal leukoplakia, achalasia, esophageal diverticulum and other diseases associated with esophageal cancer. susceptible people to monitor, popularize anti-cancer knowledge and improve anti-cancer awareness. (2) anti-mildew of grain: mild grain food contains a variety of carcinogenic toxins, so it is very important to actively carry out anti-mildew and detoxification work of food, especially the importance of anti-mildew for household grain storage. generally, the water content of grain is below 13% to meet the requirements of mildew proof. once the grain has been mildewed, it should be taken after diligence, picking when eating, washing twice and adding alkali, which can effectively reduce the intake of mycotoxins. (3) strengthening the sanitation management of drinking water: it has been found that the content of nitrosamines in water in high-incidence areas of esophageal cancer is significantly higher than that in low-incidence areas. therefore, it is very important to do a good job in environmental sanitation and prevent water pollution. gradually reduce the area where drinking pond water is used and promote soil tap water. the bleached powder disinfection should also be carried out on the ditch pond water, which can significantly reduce the nitrosamine content in water and kill other infectious diseases. (4) prevention of genetic pathogenic factors: esophageal cancer has a relatively common family aggregation phenomenon, indicating that the cancer susceptibility of family history of esophageal cancer does exist, and the monitoring work of the same generation should be strengthened. when the patient is a male, the male monitoring is strengthened, especially in the group before the age of 49. the patient is a female, and the female monitoring is strengthened, especially in the 50-69 year old population, and 2 or more esophagus should occur in 3 generations. a family that has died of cancer is considered a dangerous family. members of these families who are 40 to 69 years old are considered as risk groups. regular medical examinations, provision of preventive drugs or vitamins, and persuasion to change lifestyle habits are positive for reducing the incidence of esophageal cancer. significance. 2, secondary prevention(1) census: the high-incidence area is over 35 years old, family history of esophageal cancer, or patients with esophageal epithelial hyperplasia are classified as high-risk groups, and key monitoring is carried out, and residents over 35 years old in areas with high incidence of esophageal cancer should be investigated as much as possible. the census is mainly based on esophageal cytology. when suspicious patients are found, endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible to achieve early diagnosis. the early manifestations of esophageal cancer, such as ""swallowing discomfort"" should be well known to the general population in high-incidence areas, and the patient's visit time can be advanced for early diagnosis and treatment.(2) drug prevention of precancerous lesions: precancerous lesions of esophageal cancer mainly refer to severe hyperplasia of the esophageal epithelium, with anti-cancer b iii tablets (soybean root, sabina, white sable, yellow medicinal, prunella, caohe) six kinds of anti-cancer tablets containing anti-cancer tablets, 2mg 5-fluorouracil, anti-cancer tablets and tailuolong treatment of severe hyperplasia of esophageal epithelium, the cancer rate of the untreated group was 7.4%; the cancer rate of the treatment group: anti-cancer b group iii 2, 5%, 1,4% in the anti-cancer group, 2, 3% in the tyloron group, were significantly different from the untreated group and more normal than the untreated group. for esophageal cancer, it is impossible to completely achieve primary prevention at present. due to the long-term occurrence and development of esophageal cancer, it is a realistic and feasible method for tumor prevention if early detection, early diagnosis and timely treatment, especially the prevention of the development of precancerous lesions. since 1983, the chinese academy of sciences has conducted a study on the treatment of esophageal precancerous lesions in heshun township, lin county, henan province, and leikou township, anyang county. through esophageal cytology screening, 2,531 patients with esophageal epithelial recurrence were randomly divided into three groups, taking anti-cancer tablets, retinoic esters and placebo. a total of 3393 people were detected and randomly divided into two groups, taking riboflavin and placebo. in 3 and 5 years, the patient's medication rate was over 90%. after 3 and 5 years of medication, esophageal cytology was reviewed. the results were confirmed. anti-cancer b tablets reduced the cancer rate of esophageal re-increase by 52% and 2%, reaching the target. valetamine and riboflavin also showed a certain blocking effect, which reduced the cancer rate of esophageal re-increase and mild increase by 37, 3% and 22, 2%, respectively, and found that the dose of retinoic ester was appropriately increased. significantly improve its anti-cancer effect. after taking riboflavin for 5 years, the cancer rate of esophageal deliberation decreased by 34% and 8%, which was 22% and 2% higher than that of 3 years after taking the drug, which increased by 56% and 8%, indicating that the longer the riboflavin was taken, the effect of inhibiting mild carcinogenesis is more obvious. the anti-cancer tablets used in the experiment are made of six traditional chinese medicines, which are unique in china and low in price and easy to promote. retinoids are currently the most adequate and promising class of cancer preventives. the retinoic ester has a strong action, low toxicity and good preventive effect. riboflavin is an essential vitamin for the human body. if it can further confirm its anti-cancer effect, it has far-reaching significance.","pathogenic factors the exact cause of esophageal cancer is unknown. obviously, the environment and certain carcinogens are important pathogenic factors. nitrosamines and mycotoxins (20%): nearly 30 kinds of nitrosamines are known to induce animal tumors. in the country, benzylnitrosamine, sarcosine ethyl nitrosamine, a estradiol, nitrosamine and diethylhylamine induced esophageal cancer in rats. the investigation in china found that the content of nitrate, nitrite and secondary amine in grain and drinking water in high-incidence areas increased significantly, and the prevalence of esophageal cancer and esophageal epithelial hyperplasia is positively correlated. these substances are easy to synthesize carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach. esophageal injury (20%): esophageal injury and certain esophageal diseases can promote esophageal cancer, incidence of esophageal cancer in patients with corrosive esophageal burns and stenosis, esophageal achalasia, esophageal diverticulum or reflux esophagitis it is higher than the general population. it is presumed to be caused by long-term chronic inflammation, ulceration, or chronic irritation due to retention in the esophagus, and then esophageal epithelial hyperplasia, which eventually leads to canceration. epidemiological investigations have found that residents with high incidence of esophageal cancer have food. very hot diet, drinking spirits, eating a lot of pepper, chewing betel nut or tobacco, the chronic physicochemical stimulation of these esophageal mucosa can cause local epithelial cell proliferation, animal experiments prove that diffuse or focal epithelial hyperplasia may be precancerous lesions of esophageal cancer. malnutrition and trace element deficiency (20%): insufficient intake of animal protein and vitamin a, b2, c deficiency, is a common feature of the diet of high-level esophageal cancer residents, but most of the high-incidence areas of malnutrition, esophageal cancer is not high, therefore, this cannot be a dominant factor. genetic factors (10%): the incidence of esophageal cancer often shows family aggregation. in the surveys of shanxi, shandong, henan and other provinces in china, it is found that there are positive family history of about 1/4 to 1/2, in the high-risk area. there is a high proportion of positive family history, with the highest paternal line, the second maternal line, and the lowest sideline. pathological change the lesions of esophageal cancer are reported in different parts of china, but they are most in the middle (52, 69% to 63, 33%), followed by the lower (24, 95% to 38, 92%), and the least in the upper part (2, 80) %~14, 0%), of the 622 cases in our hospital, the middle part accounted for 68, 90%, the lower part accounted for 26, 40%, and the upper part accounted for 4, 70%. (1) clinical pathological staging and classification 1. the clinical pathology of esophageal cancer atclinical pathological stageis important for the selection of treatment options and the evaluation of therapeutic effects. the clinical pathological staging criteria formulated by the national conference on esophageal cancer in 1976. (1) pathological morphological classification of early esophageal cancer: early esophageal cancer can be divided into concealed type, erosive type, plaque type and nipple type according to its morphology. (2) pathological morphological classification of advanced and advanced esophageal cancer: it can be divided into medullary type, sputum type, ulcer type, narrowed type, intraluminal type and unshaped type, of which medullary type is the most developed, a few, advanced esophageal cancer cannot be classified as above, and is called undetermined. 2, histological classification (1) squamous cell carcinoma: the most common. (2) adenocarcinoma: less common, can be divided into simple adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. (3) undifferentiated cancer: less common, but high degree of malignancy. on the esophagus, the majority of the cancer in the middle stage is squamous cell carcinoma, and the carcinoma of the lower esophagus is mostly adenocarcinoma. (2) diffusion and metastasis of esophageal cancer 1. diffusion of the underlying cells of the esophageal cancer adjacent to the esophageal cancer or cancer in situ is one of the surface diffusion modes of cancer, and the cancer cells often have no esophageal membrane function. lymphatic infiltration of the submucosa. 2, direct infiltration of adjacent organs of the upper esophageal cancer can invade the throat, trachea and soft tissue of the neck, and even invade the bronchus, forming a bronchial-esophageal fistula; can also invade the thoracic duct, azygous vein, hilar and lung tissue, part of the invading aorta the formation of esophageal-aortic fistula, causing massive bleeding and long-term, the lower esophageal cancer can often involve the cardia and pericardium. 3, lymphatic metastasis is more common, accounting for about 2 / 3 of the case, the middle esophageal cancer often metastasis to the esophageal or hilar lymph nodes, can also be transferred to the neck, around the cardia and the left gastric lymph node, the lower esophageal cancer can often be transferred to the side of the esophagus, next to the cardia, the left gastric artery and the abdominal cavity and other lymph nodes, occasionally to the upper mediastinum and cervical lymph nodes, lymphatic metastasis in turn for the septum, abdomen, trachea and trachea, hilar and bronchi. 4, blood transfer is more common in advanced patients, the most common metastasis to the liver (about 1/4) and lung (about 1/5), other organs are bone, kidney, adrenal gland, pleura, omentum, pancreas, heart , lungs, thyroid and brain.","['resistance', 'sound hoarseness', 'difficulty swallowing', 'esophageal smooth muscles...', 'hiccup', 'gas rush']",['upper gastrointestinal bleeding'],"['oncology', 'oncology']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
upper gastrointestinal bleeding,"upper gastrointestinal bleeding refers to the digestive tract above the ligamentous ligament, including hemorrhage caused by lesions such as esophagus, stomach, duodenum or pancreas. the jejunal lesion bleeding after gastrojejunostomy is also in this range.a large amount of bleeding refers to blood loss in excess of 1000ml or circulating blood volume within 20 hours. its clinical manifestations are hematemesis and/or black feces, often accompanied by acute peripheral circulatory failure caused by decreased blood volume, which is a common emergency. the case fatality rate is as high as 8% to 13.7%. there are many causes of massive bleeding in the upper digestive tract. commonly, there are peptic ulcers, acute gastric mucosal damage, esophageal varices, and gastric cancer. acute massive bleeding or bleeding persists, and there are circulatory failures such as palpitations, cold sweats, irritability, pale complexion, damp skin, increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, and fainting. treatment consists of two major categories: surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment.because many diseases and lesions can cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the indications for surgical and non-surgical treatment of each disease are not the same.","1. actively treat the cause of bleeding. 2, pay attention to living habits, eating habits, emotional, to avoid stimulating factors.","1, esophageal disease: esophagitis, esophageal cancer, esophageal peptic ulcer, esophageal injury (physical injury); esophageal cardia mucosal tear syndrome (mallory-weiss syndrome), device examination, foreign or radioactive damage, chemical damage; strong acid damage caused by strong alkali or other chemicals. 2, gastroduodenal diseases: peptic ulcer, acute gastritis, chronic gastritis, gastric mucosal prolapse, gastric cancer, acute gastric dilatation, duodenitis, zhuo-ai syndrome, post-surgical lesions. 3, jejunal disease: jejunal crohn's disease, gastrointestinal ulcer after gastrointestinal anastomosis. 1, a variety of cirrhosis decompensation period. 2, portal vein obstruction portal vein, portal vein thrombosis, portal vein compression by adjacent masses. 3. hepatic vein occlusion syndrome. 1, biliary bleeding: bile duct or gallbladder stones, gallbladder or cholangiocarcinoma, postoperative biliary drainage tube caused by biliary compression necrosis, liver cancer or hepatic aneurysm broke into the biliary tract. 2, pancreatic disease: involving duodenal pancreatic cancer, acute pancreatitis complicated by abscess ulceration. 3, aneurysm broke into the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, aortic aneurysm, liver or spleen aneurysm rupture. 4. the mediastinal tumor or abscess breaks into the esophagus. 1, blood diseases: leukemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemophilia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and other coagulation mechanisms. 2, uremia. 3, vascular diseases: atherosclerosis, allergic purpura, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, elastic pseudo-yellow tumors. 4. nodular polyarteritis: systemic lupus erythematosus or other vasculitis. 5, stress ulcer sepsis: trauma, burns or major surgery, shock, adrenal glucocorticoid treatment, cerebrovascular accident or other craniocerebral lesions, emphysema and pulmonary heart disease caused by stress. 6, disease factors: 1 esophageal lesions, esophageal tumors, esophageal scar stenosis, etc., resulting in food or small food retention.2 mediastinal lesions mediastinal tumor or abscess formation lesions, oppression of the esophagus, resulting in esophageal stricture, easy to retain food or small foreign bodies.3 neurological lesions pharyngeal reflexes or swallowing reflexes are diminished, which may cause accidental swallowing.","['vagus nerves excited', 'black stool with blood', 'pale pale', 'lethal upper respiratory tract bleeding', 'nails suddenly whitening', 'vomiting blood', 'black stool', 'ascites', 'disgusting ']",['peritonitis'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment']"

food poisoning,"food poisoning has a wide range of meanings, including food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria and their toxins, food contaminated with poisons, or acute poisoning diseases caused by animals and plants that contain toxins such as poisonous mites and puffer fish.according to the causes of food poisoning, they are divided into two categories. first, bacterial food poisoning, deteriorating foods, unclean hands, tableware and flies are the main routes of transmission.the second is non-bacterial food poisoning, which is found in food contaminated with toxic substances or the consumption of toxic animals and plants. there are many reasons for food poisoning. the most common and most common cause is food contamination by bacteria. clinical manifestations of acute gastrointestinal symptoms such as above vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, severe cases may be life-threatening due to dehydration, shock, circulatory failure.","1. do a good job in food hygiene supervision and canteen hygiene. it is forbidden to eat sick and dead poultry or other degraded meat.it is best not to eat drunk shrimps, salted crabs, etc. 2, refrigerated food should be quality and fresh, animal food should be thoroughly heated before cooking, and should be fully heated before the meal. 3, cooking and cooking should be separated to avoid cross-contamination. 4, canned salted food, should be boiled for 6 to 10 minutes before eating. 5. it is forbidden to consume poisonous animals and plants such as poisonous cockroaches and puffer fish. 6. if the cook or nurse has a salmonella infection or a carrier, the worker should be removed from the work and returned to the original position after 3 stool cultures are negative.","nan there are many reasons for food poisoning, which can be divided into the following categories:there are many reasons for food poisoning. the most common reason is that food is contaminated by bacteria. according to the statistics of food poisoning in china in the past five years, bacterial food poisoning accounts for about 50% of the total food poisoning, while animal food is the main food causing bacterial food poisoning, among which meat and cooked meat products rank first, followed by spoiled poultry, sick and dead meat and fish, milk, leftovers. wait. there are several reasons for food contamination by bacteria: 1. poultry and livestock are sick birds and sick animals before slaughter; 2. cutlery, chopping boards and utensils are unclean, raw and cooked cross-infection; 3. poor hygiene, mosquitoes and flies; 4, food workers with bacteria contaminated food; 5, not fully heated before eating, not fully cooked. the initiators of bacterial food poisoning include salmonella, staphylococcus, escherichia coli, botox, and hepatitis virus. fungi grow and multiply in grains or other foods to produce toxic metabolites. poisoning of toxic substances such as humans and animals is called fungal food poisoning. poisoning occurs mainly through food contaminated by fungi, using common cooking methods. heat treatment can not destroy the mycotoxin in food. the growth and reproduction of fungi and the production of toxins require certain temperature and humidity. therefore, poisoning often has obvious seasonality and regionality. food poisoning caused by ingestion of animal poisoning foods is animal food poisoning. there are two main types of animal poisoning foods; certain parts of animals or animals that naturally contain toxic components are used as foods, and ingestion causes poisoning reactions; a large number of edible animal foods with toxic components, such as eating squid, can also cause poisoning. in recent years, animal food poisoning in china is mainly puffer fish poisoning, followed by fish gallbladder poisoning. there are mainly three kinds: 1) plants or their processed products that naturally contain toxic components are used as foods, such as tung oil, cannabis oil, etc.; 2 plants that fail to destroy or remove toxic components during food processing. as food, such as cassava, bitter almonds, etc.; 3 under certain conditions, improper consumption of a large number of toxic ingredients of plant food, edible fresh day lily, germinated potatoes, unsalted pickles or uncooked lentils, etc. poisoning, usually caused by eating poisonous plants or toxic plant seeds, or improper cooking and processing methods, without removing the toxic substances in the plant, the most common plant food poisoning is bean poisoning, poisonous mushroom poisoning, cassava poisoning; toxic mushrooms causing death, potatoes, mandala, ginkgo, bitter almonds, tung oil, etc., most of the plant poisoning has no specific treatment, for some serious poisoning that can cause death, it is very important to eliminate the poison to the prognosis of the poisoned person as soon as possible. mainly include: 1 eating food contaminated with toxic chemicals; 2 adding food additives that are not food-grade or forged or banned, foods for nutritional supplements, and food poisoning caused by excessive use of food additives 3; foods that cause chemical changes in nutrients due to storage, etc., such as rancidity caused by poisoning, food poisoning caused by chemical poisoning foods is chemical food poisoning, the characteristics of chemical food poisoning are: onset and eating time it is related to the amount of food. it usually occurs soon after eating. it is often group-based. patients have the same clinical manifestations. the remaining chemical foods, vomit, blood and urine can be detected in chemical poisons. when dealing with chemical food poisoning, highlight a ""fast"" word!timely processing is not only important for saving the lives of patients, but also for controlling developments, especially when group poisoning and chemical poisons are not known for a while.","['fever with abdominal pain,...', 'lary gland sweat glands and parotid glands...', 'common in the ramie sputum...', 'diarrhea', 'food allergy', 'hepatic cell scaffold collapse' , 'metabolic acidosis', 'shoulder belt's simulation paralysis']",['shock'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
esophageal achalasia,"athelixia is a primary general esophageal motor dysfunction disease characterized by: 1 no peristalsis in the esophageal body.2 the lower esophageal sphincter does not relax or is not completely relaxed when swallowing.3 at the resting time, the lower end of the esophageal sphincter pressure increased.although achalasia is a benign disease, it has a great impact on quality of life, health and longevity. due to difficulty in swallowing, patients can use all methods, including body position, drinking water, repeated swallowing, etc., so that patients are ashamed to eat in front of everyone. may eat alone, causing psychological stress and seriously affecting social activities.","there is no effective preventive measure for this disease, and early diagnosis and early treatment are the key.","the disease is characterized by distal esophageal stenosis, prolonged flexion of the body, thickening of the muscular layer, especially the ring muscle, histological examination of ganglion cells, mononuclear cell infiltration of the intestinal myenteric plexus in the esophagus and fibrosis, the number of ganglion cells in the distal esophagus is reduced, vagus nerve fibers, regardless of myelin rupture, neurofilament rupture, axoplasmic swelling, axonal - xuwang membrane and axonal membrane separation, vagus nerve dorsal nucleus and the structure has abnormal changes, the ultrastructure of esophageal smooth muscle can be seen off the microfilament, therefore, it can be seen from the brain stem, vagus nerve fibers, intestinal muscle plexus until the muscle nerve fibers are degenerative, the esophagus loses innervation, but how the virus, exotoxin, cancer, parasites and gastrin affect, and where the primary lesions are, etc., the pathogenesis is still unclear.","['anti-gastric', 'tension', 'weight loss', 'post-sternal pain', 'difficulty swallowing']",['diaphragmatic hernia'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
esophageal diverticulum,"the diverticulumofoesophagus is also known as zenker's diverticulum in clinical practice. it refers to the saclike protrusion that communicates with the esophagus, and its classification is complicated.according to the location of the disease, it can be divided into pharyngeal esophageal diverticulum, middle esophageal diverticulum and supracondylar esophageal diverticulum. according to its pathogenesis, it can be divided into traction, internal pressure and traction internal pressure diverticulum. according to the structure of diverticulum wall, it can be divided into true diverticulum. (containing the full layer of the esophageal wall) and pseudodural diverticulum (the muscle layer lacking the esophageal wall).in addition, it can be divided into congenital diverticulum and acquired diverticulum.","there is no effective preventive measure for this disease. therefore, when there are suspicious symptoms mentioned above, it should be checked in time to achieve early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment.go to bed early and get up early and exercise.insufficient sleep can reduce the body's immune function, and it is also easy to stimulate the fire, causing external injuries.keep your mind calm.avoid anger in the spring, do not be too impatient, always keep your mind calm, stop smoking, drink less alcohol and coffee.smoking is the most vulnerable to damage to the respiratory surface barrier and induces disease onset.","muscle movement disorder (30%): pharyngeal esophageal diverticulum is often not caused by a single factor, mostly due to circumflex pharyngeal muscle and esophageal muscle dysmotility, achalasia or other motor abnormalities, resulting in mucosal bulging on the above anatomical basis to form a diverticulum. food stimulation (20%): a very small number of pharyngeal esophageal diverticulum cancers may be caused by long-term food and secretion stimulation. patients habitually press the diverticulum to facilitate diverticulum emptying, which may also be a cause of cancer. if the wall of the iliac crest is irregular during the angiography, the sputum cancer should be highly suspected and further examination is needed. lymph node inflammation (20%): the middle esophagus diverticulum can be bulging or pull-out type, most of which are pull-out type diverticulum. the etiology and performance of the esophageal bulging diverticulum and the supraorbital diverticulum are completely similar, while the pull-out type diverticulum is due to inflammation of the parabronchial lymph nodes or scarring caused by tuberculosis, it has a full-thickness tissue of the esophagus, including mucosa, submucosa and muscle layers, and the neck is narrow and narrow like a tent. the pull-out type diverticulum occurs mostly in the anterior and right wall of the esophagus at the bifurcation of the trachea. some authors believe that a part of the esophageal diverticulum that is unrelated to abnormal esophageal movement is a congenital intestinal cyst or esophageal duplication. pathogenesis the mechanism of esophageal diverticulum has been controversial. zenker's diverticulum has always been thought to be caused by dysregulation of the pharyngeal and upper esophageal muscles. knuff and other specially designed pressure recording systems have studied 9 cases of zenker's diverticulum and 15 cases of no esophageal disease. the control, but did not find evidence of inconsistent activity of the pharynx and upper esophageal muscles, recently cook et al. 14 cases of zenker's diverticulum case and 9 controls were simultaneously studied using tv fluoroscopy and manometer, embedded in the pressure catheter the signs of the transmission line recorded the contraction and relaxation activities simultaneously at different locations and at different times. it was found that there was no difference between the diverticulum patients and the control subjects. compared with the control, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxation was normal in the diverticulum, but the maximum open scale significantly reduced, it is believed that this diverticulum is reduced by the opening of the upper esophageal sphincter, thereby increasing the pressure of the inferior vagina, so that the diverticulum is formed, not caused by the inconsistency of the pharyngeal esophageal muscles or the abnormal sphincter relaxation. the middle esophageal diverticulum is mostly caused by inflammation and adhesion around the esophagus. therefore, it is a traction type, with tuberculosis, and can also be seen in patients with scleroderma.accompanied by esophageal hiatus hernia, may be related to reflux esophagitis, the pseudo-diverticulum in the esophageal wall is mostly due to submucosal gland inflammation, inflammatory cells infiltrating the gland, causing gland obstruction, expansion and formation of capsular bags, so multiple in the esophageal fistula, gastroesophageal reflux and candidiasis, watarai and other recent reports, there are cases of congenital esophageal wall pseudo-diverticulum.","['anti-gastric', 'the fistula between the airway and the esophagus', 'cachexia', 'inflammation', 'dyspnea', 'lung atelect', 'have foreign body in the throat']",['lung abscess'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
esophageal rupture,"esophageal rupture can occur in blunt, sharp, and firearm injuries, as well as spontaneous esophageal rupture due to severe vomiting.due to the food containing various bacteria and the reflux of the digestive juice in the stomach into the mediastinum, it can cause serious mediastinal infection.early stage may have sudden chest pain or upper abdominal pain, and radiate to the shoulder and back, and have fever, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.","the prognosis of this disease depends on the time of diagnosis, the location of the rupture, the underlying disease, the esophageal basis, and the presence or absence of spontaneous parietal pleural rupture, although the mortality of boerhaaves syndrome has been greatly reduced since barrett first successfully sutured the gap in 1947 (31). %), but delayed diagnosis can significantly increase complications, increase the difficulty and cost of treatment, and is the main cause of high mortality. clinicians must be highly vigilant about this disease, comprehensive observation, thinking, early diagnosis, correct treatment, can save more patients.",causes of esophageal rupture include the following: (1) knife and gunshot wounds and esophagus. (2) chest blunt contusion. (3) accidental swallowing of foreign bodies can pierce the esophagus. (4) the esophagus can be accidentally injured during esophagoscopy.

esophageal leiomyoma,"esophageal leiomyoma (leiomyomaofesophagus) is a benign tumor originating from the esophageal smooth muscle. the site of occurrence is more common in the middle part of the esophagus, followed by the lower part, and the neck is rare. most of the lesions occur in the wall, and the rest can be in the cavity, under the adventitia. and a small number of diffuse, so that the esophageal muscle layer is extensive tumor-like hyperplasia.benign esophageal tumors are rare, accounting for about 0.5 to 0.8 of all esophageal tumors. because the symptoms are mild or asymptomatic, patients often do not seek medical treatment or are ignored by clinicians.in recent years, due to advances in x-ray and other examination techniques, the number of cases discovered has gradually increased, 90% of which are esophageal leiomyoma. esophageal leiomyoma is the most common benign esophageal tumor, accounting for the first place in benign esophageal tumors, accounting for 3/4 of benign tumors in the esophageal wall, and the ratio of esophageal cancer is 1:127 to 233. esophageal leiomyomas are generally small and often have no clinical symptoms.the actual incidence is still unclear. most authors believe that the incidence of esophageal leiomyoma should be higher than the literature statistics, and the autopsy discovery rate is 1100:1.according to the large-scale literature reports in recent years, esophageal leiomyomas account for 5% to 10% of the gastrointestinal leiomyoma, accounting for 50% to 80% of all esophageal benign tumors and cysts.","when diagnosing leiomyomas, the possibility of esophageal malignant tumors must be considered for the identification and exclusion. mucosal biopsy should not be performed during esophagoscopy to avoid damage and mucosal adhesion to the tumor, which may hinder subsequent surgical removal. the effect is good, the trauma is small and the complications are less than extramucosal tumor removal. the partial esophagectomy should not be performed lightly.","(1) the cause of esophageal leiomyomas is still unclear. it occurs in the esophageal muscularis, and can also come from the vascular muscle layer of the esophageal wall and the vagus embryonic muscle tissue. the study of esophageal leiomyomas shows that 74% of leiomyomas originated from the inner ring muscle, 18% originated from the submucosal muscle layer, 8% originated from the external longitudinal muscle, the tumor was expansive to the lumen, and the outer growth, 97% of the tumor was intramural growth, 2% to the mediastinum, 1% of the tumor protrudes into the esophageal lumen, with pedicles such as polyps. the leiomyomas originating from the inner ring muscle grow in the muscle along the long diameter of the esophagus, and protrude into the cavity due to low mucosal and submucosal resistance. leiomyomas originating from the submucosal muscle layer are more likely to protrude into the cavity, even polypoid. the leiomyomas originating from the external longitudinal muscle can grow outside the esophagus and are sometimes mistaken for mediastinal masses. (b) pathogenesis esophageal leiomyomas originated in the esophageal muscularis, mainly in the longitudinal muscles, most of them in the esophageal wall, that is, the outer wall of the mucosa is in the shape, individual protruding into the lumen is polypoid, pedicle connected to the wall of the esophagus, there is a report of vomiting from the mouth. such patients may also block the respiratory tract during vomiting and cause asphyxia. the foreign literature of the esophageal leiomyomas is reported in the lower part of the esophagus, followed by the middle section, and the upper part is rare. the domestic report is more common in the middle part of the esophagus, followed by the lower part. the upper part is rare. the majority of the tumors are single, the minority is multiple, the number of multiple is variable, and the number is more than two to ten. due to the length of the disease, the size varies greatly. some people reported a maximum diameter of 28cm, the smallest diameter of 1cm, but 85% of the tumor diameter <4cm, the minimum weight of 0.25g, the most reported in the literature reached 5000g. tumors generally have different shapes, mostly round or oval, accounting for 60% of all cases, irregular (ginger-shaped) (fig. 1) accounting for 10%, horseshoe shape accounting for 8%, and other irregular shapes such as spiral. dumbbell-shaped, cord-shaped, nodular or lobulated, or surrounding the esophagus. the surface of the tumor is smooth, with a complete fibrous envelope, tough texture, easy to separate from the esophageal mucosa. the esophageal leiomyomas can be seen with criss-crossing muscle bundles. the blood vessels are sparse, grayish white, or yellow. the cut surface sometimes shows focal hemorrhage, liquefaction or calcification, etc., can be seen in the form of bundles, braided or swirling smooth muscle fiber bundles, the cells are long spindle-shaped, well differentiated, rich in cytoplasm, eosinophilic, clear boundaries, nucleus fusiform, no atypical mitotic figures, some of the fibers are mucoid or hyalin degeneration, and a few of them show calcium deposits. unlike other leiomyomas in other parts of the digestive tract, esophageal leiomyomas have few malignant changes, and the reported malignant rate is about 0.24% to 3.3%.","['anti-gastric', 'the fistula between the airway and the esophagus', 'stagnation', 'black stool', 'disgusting', 'repetitive hematemesis', 'belch']",['sudden death'],"['oncology', 'tumor surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
esophageal scarring,"the most common cause of esophageal scar stenosis is the swallowing of strong alkali or strong acid causing chemical burns of the esophagus. the scar tissue shrinks after healing and the esophageal lumen is narrow.after swallowing caustic chemicals such as acid and alkali, the mouth, throat, and sternum sometimes showed burning pain and drooling, nausea, vomiting, low fever, and irritability. the patient refused to eat.in addition, gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis forms ulcers and scar contractions.scarring can also occur after esophageal trauma and surgery.","in prevention, there should be a few points: 1. vigorously promote the harm of children's esophageal burns to society and family and children's physical and mental health; 2 apply a fixed container to store strong acid and alkali chemical corrosive agents, and mark them conspicuously, and store them in children. where it is not easy to get, environmental safety is a guarantee for preventing accidental injuries in children. 2. strengthen the health awareness of preventing accidental injuries among children, and use some educational films, brochures and other forms to promote the preventability and prevention of esophageal burns in kindergartens, schools and communities, especially in rural areas. . 3, parents, kindergartens, schools should strengthen the safety education for young children, using cartoons, games and other methods to cultivate children's ability to identify and reduce the phenomenon of misconduct. 4. strengthen rural health care work and prevention, treatment and training of esophageal burns, so that children can receive timely and correct treatment, and those who are seriously transferred should be transferred to the hospital as soon as possible to reduce the damage. 5, far away from the hospital, can be rescued at home, such as taking acid, immediately take cooking oil, milk, egg white, liquid paraffin, to protect the digestive tract mucosa, accidentally take strong alkali, immediately take lemon juice, orange juice or rice vinegar and other neutralization acidity and alkalinity, remember to ban gastric lavage after strong acid and alkali, induce vomiting, neutralize corrosive agents in time, the earlier the treatment time, the lighter the degree of esophageal infection and stenosis, the fewer times the esophagus is dilated, the better the effect.","chemical factors (45%): most cases of esophageal chemical burns in children are caused by accidental use of household acidic or alkaline chemicals, and adults are mostly due to attempted suicide. disease factors (35%): esophageal scar stenosis can also be formed in the case of repeated recurrence of esophageal malignant tumors. in another case, on the basis of long-term inflammation and ulceration in the lower esophagus, if gastroesophageal reflux occurs, it can also cause the esophagus is narrow. etiology esophageal chemical burns are mostly caused by suicides in children due to accidental use of household acidic or alkaline chemicals. pathological changes after swallowing caustic chemicals, the esophageal tissue is burned. the severity of the damage is related to the type, concentration, amount, and length of exposure of the swallowed chemical. alkaline chemicals cause liquefaction necrosis of the tissue and can penetrate into the deep tissue of the esophageal wall. in severe cases, the whole layer of the esophageal wall may be ulcerated and perforated. acidic chemicals cause tissue coagulative necrosis, and the degree of damage to esophageal tissue is generally lighter than that of alkaline chemicals, but high concentrations of acidic chemicals can also cause severe damage. the gastric mucosa is sensitive to acidic chemicals, and the gastric mucosal damage caused by fasting exposure to strong acid is often more serious than the esophagus. caustic chemicals generally have a longer residence time in the natural stenosis of the esophagus, and the damage caused at these sites is also heavier. the degree of tissue damage caused by chemical burns of the esophagus can be divided into three levels. once burned lesions are limited to the esophageal mucosa causing congestion, edema and epithelial shedding, no scar tissue after healing, or only a small amount of scar tissue, the esophageal lumen may not be narrow. the degree of injury to the esophageal tissue was twice as deep as that of the mucosa and submucosa, forming an ulcer. the granulation tissue was grown 2 to 3 weeks after the burn, and the scar was formed after healing to cause esophageal stenosis. third-degree burns involve lesions involving the entire esophageal wall and even the tissues around the esophagus, often leading to perforation of the esophagus and acute mediastinal inflammation. esophageal scar stenosis caused by gastroesophageal reflux often occurs on the basis of long-term inflammation and ulceration in the lower esophagus. postoperative esophageal scar stenosis occurs in the esophageal and gastrointestinal anastomosis sites, and granulation tissue grows during the healing process to form a circular scar stenosis.","['inflammation', 'difficulty breathing', 'difficulty swallowing', 'irritable', 'low fever', 'disgusting']",['esophageal injury'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
sodium pentachlorophenol poisoning,"sodium pentachlorophenol is currently used as a drug for preventing snails in blood. it also kills grasshoppers, cockroaches, fruit tree pests, fungi, bacteria, etc. it can also be used as a wood preservative and agricultural herbicide. it is widely used, but people and animals are also very toxic.sodium pentachlorophenol can enter the human body through the respiratory tract, digestive tract and skin. if it exceeds a certain amount in the body, it will cause sodium pentachlorophenol poisoning, but there is no accumulation effect. 70% of the urine is discharged within 24 hours after entering the human body, 4%. ~7% is discharged from the gastrointestinal tract and can be drained within 4 days.sodium pentachlorophenol has certain damage to the liver and kidney, and inhalation from the respiratory tract can cause pneumonia.it has a stimulating effect on the skin mucosa and can cause contact dermatitis.the acute lethal dose of adults entering through various routes is about 2g.","do a good job in health promotion: 1 education children should not play in the application site, which can reduce the chance of infection in children. 2 it is forbidden to eat food contaminated with sodium pentachlorophenolate, water and poisoned birds, animals and fish.in the diet, we must pay attention to cleanliness and improve the safety of food. 3 it is forbidden to wash hands, feet and swim in the water to be applied. 4 this product must be kept in a safe place to prevent children from accidentally touching and eating.put sodium pentachlorophenol in a place that is not accessible to children, so as to avoid eating in children.","cause: foods contaminated with sodium pentachlorophenolate (such as food and poisoned poultry, livestock, fish, etc.) and water, as well as inhaled or contaminated skin, can be poisoned, and elevated environmental temperatures can increase their toxic effects.","['coma', 'circulatory failure', 'diarrhea', 'irritability', 'abdominal pain', 'twitching', 'weakness', 'disgusting', 'dehydration']",['cough'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
gastric heart syndrome,"gastrocardiac syndrome, also known as roemheld syndrome, refers to a dysfunction of the cardiovascular system due to the reflexivity of stomach diseases.more common in young people, male and female incidence is similar.the cause of this disease is unclear, may be related to autonomic dysfunction, all stomach diseases can be caused, but common causes are digestive ulcers, chronic gastritis, gastric mucosal prolapse, stomach cancer and smoking, etc., esophageal lesions, such as reflux esophagitis, esophageal or pyloric stenosis can also be caused.","the prevention of this disease is mainly the prevention of stomach diseases, should pay attention to quit smoking and alcohol, and actively carry out physical exercise. first, regular quantitative feeding.gastric acid secretion has a certain regularity, that is, the peak of secretion during three meals a day, eating snacks often, making the stomach work disorder, destroying the normal rhythm of gastric acid secretion, which can lead to stomach disease for a long time. therefore, the daily diet should be three meals a day, not eat too much snacks.the amount of food consumed per meal should be moderate, hunger or overeating, or hunger, eating and eating unevenly, causing the stomach to malfunction and causing indigestion. therefore, it is necessary to develop good hygienic habits at regular intervals and at regular intervals. second, advocate smoking cessation and moderate drinking.if you have a digestive system disease, you should immediately quit smoking and drinking.smoking can make the stomach vasoconstriction, reduce the blood supply to the stomach, inhibit the secretion of gastric mucus, aggravate the gastric mucosal damage, moderate consumption of low-alcohol, can increase the blood flow of the blood vessels in the stomach, causing gastric mucosal congestion, edema, erosion, even bleeding, so you can drink low-alcohol such as rice wine, beer, wine, etc. third, pay attention to food hygiene.take care of the ""sickness from the mouth"", and wash your hands after meals.raw fruits should be rinsed clean.avoid food contamination on pathogenic bacteria.do not eat spoilage, mildew food.","autonomic dysfunction (30%): it is a syndrome of visceral dysfunction.including the symptoms of circulatory system, digestive system function or sexual dysfunction, mostly caused by psychosocial factors, some of the physiological functions of the human body are temporarily dysfunctional, and there are related changes in neuroendocrine and no corresponding pathological changes in the structure. chronic gastritis (25%): various chronic gastric mucosal inflammatory lesions caused by different causes are a common disease, and its incidence rate ranks first among various stomach diseases.since the wide application of fiber endoscopy, the understanding of this disease has been significantly improved.common chronic superficial gastritis, chronic erosive gastritis and chronic atrophic gastritis. esophageal lesions (25%): inflammation caused by edema and congestion of the esophageal mucosa due to abnormal stimulation of the superficial or deep tissue of the esophageal mucosa.these stimuli include stomach acid, bile, vomiting, bile, spirits, peppers, too hot soups, too hot tea, and so on.","[ 'chest stuffiness', 'qi short', 'arrhythmia', 'angina pectoris']",['gastric cancer'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
stomach injury,"various injury factors with a certain intensity can cause gastric damage. however, since the stomach is in a protected anatomical position in the abdominal cavity, the gastric cavity is mostly in an empty state and can move within a certain range in the abdominal cavity. there are not many opportunities for injury from outside violence.even if injured, it is often accompanied by other organ damage in the abdomen.","first, avoid mental stress when a person is nervous, troubled, angry, his negative emotions can spread to the limbic system through the cerebral cortex, affecting the autonomic nervous system, directly leading to gastrointestinal dysfunction. second, avoid excessive fatigue whether it is physical labor or mental work, if fatigue is excessive, it will cause insufficient gastrointestinal blood supply, secretion dysfunction, excessive gastric acid and decreased mucus, causing damage to the mucosa. third, avoid alcohol abuse alcohol can directly damage the gastric mucosa, alcohol can also cause cirrhosis and chronic pancreatitis, which in turn aggravates the stomach damage. fourth, avoid smoking, smoking, smoking can promote gastric mucosal vasoconstriction, reduce the synthesis of prostaglandins in the gastric mucosa, which is a mucosal protective factor.smoking also stimulates the secretion of gastric acid and protease, which aggravates the damage to the mucosa. fifth, avoid hunger and inequality. six, avoid eating unclean.","(1) causes of the disease stomach damage is caused by the following reasons: traumatic violence traumatic violence can cause stomach damage in the chest, abdomen or lower back. according to the nature of trauma, it can be divided into: (1) blunt injury: this kind of violence acts on the body surface and does not cause the body cavity to communicate with the outside world. the common way is from punching, kicking, and car accidents. according to barry's quote, in industrialized countries, about 70% blunt abdominal injury is caused by a car accident. (2) through damage: the wound of the body surface and the body cavity caused by a knife or a gunshot wound. 2. chemical damage due to the ingestion of acid, alkali and other corrosive poisons. 3. iatrogenic injury including the trauma caused by gastroscopy and accidental injury during surgery, etc., because the current application of the gastroscope is mostly flexible fiber optic gastroscope, the gastric wall damage caused by gastroscopy has been greatly reduced, but in some cases, the stomach there are lesions such as inflammation, ulcers or tumors. this operation can sometimes cause complications such as stomach bleeding and perforation. the iatrogenic injury in the operation can be caused by anatomical difficulties and operational errors. for example, when the splenectomy is used to ligature the short gastric vessels, the vascular clamp is too close to the stomach to damage the stomach wall; the highly selective vagus nerve is used to tear the card or anatomy. localized ischemic necrosis caused by small curvature of the stomach; separation of gastric mucosa around the antrum and duodenum during biliary or right colectomy to damage the antrum of the stomach; small curvature of the stomach may be needled when the esophagus repairs the esophageal hiatus such as tearing, these accidents can generally be found at the time of surgery and immediately repaired without adverse consequences, a small number of cases due to improper operation caused by ischemia caused by postoperative peritonitis or stomach cramps and other complications. in addition to the above reasons, there have been reports of gastric perforation due to excessive force of extracorporeal cardiac compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 4. foreign body in the stomach occasionally negligent, deliberate suicide or mentally ill patients may swallow foreign matter into the stomach, most foreign objects can be discharged by themselves, when the object is too large, both ends sharp or jagged objects are difficult to discharge, can lead to obstruction, bleeding, or even perforation. 5. spontaneous rupture spontaneous gastric rupture in adults is extremely rare. this name does not actually mean a sudden rupture of the stomach without any background factors. it is generally believed that the important predisposing factor for this disease is the obstruction of the stomach outlet (the cardia or pylorus). severe vomiting occurs when the stomach is inflated, and excessive force or weight can cause the stomach wall to rupture due to excessive tension. it has also been reported in the literature that a large amount of baking soda or anesthesia is swallowed and a large amount of narcotic gas is swallowed. cases of gastric rupture caused by excessive gastric expansion. (two) pathogenesis the damage caused by external violence and its pathological changes will be described in detail below. non-penetrating injury when the upper abdomen suffers from blunt injury, the stomach damage is less common, because it is not like the liver, the spleen tissue is prone to fragmentation, unlike the duodenum and duodenum jejunum, and it is also affected by the ribs. the protection is only when the stomach is filled with food or gas liquid; when the front wall of the stomach and the large curvature have more contact with the peritoneum of the abdominal wall, the possibility of gastric rupture is greatly increased when the filling stomach cannot move freely. under blunt force (stolen, kick, impact, etc.), the abdominal wall can be completely free of morphological damage, while the stomach wall shows varying degrees of damage, and the muscle layer of the stomach (mostly in small bends) has lacerations. there may be no obvious clinical symptoms at all, the stomach wall is contused and hematoma is formed in the stomach wall. at that time, there may be no symptoms, but once the hematoma is infected, an abscess is formed, and the stomach wall is necrotic and pierced, causing secondary peritonitis. the damage caused by the full-layer rupture of the stomach wall is the most dangerous. at this time, most of the liver, spleen, colon, ribs, etc. may also rupture at the same time. the waves or water waves formed during the rupture may also cause part of the stomach wall. or full-thickness rupture, the patient occasionally after severe vomiting or retching, may be due to esophageal mucosal laceration followed by hematemesis, is called mollary-weiss syndrome, is a rare upper gastrointestinal bleeding, gan jianhui et al a male patient after a high-voltage electric shock was surgically explored for acute peritonitis, and a perforation of the stomach and jejunum occurred. 2. penetrating injury the penetrating injury of the stomach often occurs simultaneously with the damage of its adjacent organs, and the damage of the stomach itself is often more than one place, often penetrating wounds. 628 cases of abdominal wounds reported by ogilvie (1944), including 22 cases of gastric injury the case fatality rate was 50%. wolff (1955) analyzed 416 cases of gastric penetrating injury, which accounted for 13.2% of all abdominal injuries; 90% of cases were accompanied by other intra-abdominal injuries, especially with transverse injury. see (47.10%), the case fatality rate is 40.6%, higher than the colon, small intestine and liver, the mortality rate of spleen injury, the penetrating injury rate of the stomach is very high, because the stomach damage often has other organs damage. therefore, simple gastric injury is better, because the stomach wall is more resistant to injury, and the contents of the stomach do not contain a large amount of bacteria like the contents of the colon and small intestine. 3. surgical injury the accidental injury of the stomach wall during surgery is most common in splenectomy. when the gastric spleen ligament is cut, the stomach wall of the large curved part of the stomach may be clamped and cut. when the biliary tract is repeated, due to its own lesions and the second operation often makes the stomach and duodenum together with the transverse colon and the omentum stick together, and even difficult to separate from the abdominal wall, so the possibility of accidentally injuring the stomach and duodenum during surgery is also very high. if the accident is detected at the time, the damage to the stomach wall is generally not difficult to mend, and usually does not cause serious consequences; but if it is not detected in time, the person who is seriously sewed will form peritonitis or fistula.","['shock', 'liver dullness or disappearance', 'gut sound', 'moving dullness', 'breathing difficulty', 'peritoneal irritation', 'abdominal pain', 'stomach mucosal damage']","['peritonitis', 'infectious shock', 'mediastinal emphysema', 'pneumothorax', 'subcutaneous emphysema of the chest wall']","['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
gastroptosis,"gastroptosis refers to the lower edge of the stomach reaching the pelvic cavity when standing. the lowest point of the small curved curve of the stomach falls below the sputum line, which is called gastric ptosis. the occurrence of this disease is mostly due to insufficient suspension force of the diaphragm, liver and stomach, stomach and stomach. the ligament function is reduced and relaxed, the intra-abdominal pressure is lowered, and the abdominal muscles are relaxed. in addition to the body shape or physical constitution, the stomach is extremely low-profile fish structure, which is the tension-free stomach seen by the stomach drooping.this disease is part of the visceral sagging, more common in the long and weak body type, long-term sick and weak, menstruation, multiple abdominal surgery with incisional hernia and long-term bed rest. mild gastroptosis is asymptomatic, moderate to severe gastrointestinal motility, dyspepsia.because of the various symptoms of sagging stomach, the patient suffers from excessive stress for a long time, resulting in insomnia, headache, dizziness, dullness, depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as hypotension, palpitations and standing fainting.","1, eat less meals because the digestive function of patients with gastric ptosis is weakened, too much food will enter the stomach, which will inevitably stay in the stomach and cause indigestion.therefore, the first requirement of diet conditioning is that the amount of each meal should be less, but the number can be increased, 4-6 meals a day is appropriate. 2, chewing slowly the gastric wall tension of patients with gastric ptosis is reduced, chewing slowly to facilitate digestion and absorption, and to enhance gastric motility and promote emptying speed, and relieve abdominal discomfort. 3, the food is soft the food you eat should be soft, light and easy to digest.the staple food should be soft rice, such as noodles to be boiled soft; non-staple food should be chopped and fried, eat less cold vegetables.however, it should be noted that the fish must not be over-cooked, because the fish is the most tender and digestible when it is half-baked, and has the least burden on the stomach. 4, nutritional balance most of the patients with gastroptosis are weak in physical strength and muscle strength. in addition, the digestion and absorption are not good, and it is easy to cause imbalance in the body's nutrition. therefore, it is more fatigued and less energetic than normal people.therefore, patients should pay attention to the balance of dietary nutrition on the basis of a small number of meals, and the ratio of sugar, fat and protein is suitable.the proportion of fat is lower. 5, reduce the stimulus irritating foods such as pepper, ginger, excessive alcohol, coffee, cola and strong tea can aggravate the symptoms of acid reflux and heartburn in patients with gastroptosis, affecting the improvement of the disease. therefore, these foods should be eaten as little as possible, with limited restrictions. .drinking a small amount of fruit wine and light tea is beneficial to slow down the occurrence and development of gastric ptosis. 6, prevent constipation more fruits and vegetables are mixed in the daily diet, because fruits and vegetables contain more vitamins and cellulose, especially the latter can promote gastrointestinal motility, so that the stool becomes soft and smooth, preventing constipation.for example, drink a cup of light salt water in the morning or drink honey sesame oil before going to bed to relieve and eliminate constipation. 7, suitable for both movements and statics active participation in physical exercise for patients with gastroptosis helps prevent the progression of gastric sag, and can also increase gastric tension, stomach motility, and improve symptoms due to increased physical strength and muscle strength. in short, should develop good eating habits, regular quantitative, for the body thinner, should increase nutrition.should actively participate in physical exercise, such as walking, practicing qigong, playing tai chi.to prevent the disease, you must also maintain optimism.it is also possible to use a simple and easy-to-learn fitness method. if you have chronic digestive diseases, you should actively and thoroughly treat them to reduce the incidence of the disease.","according to the opinions of ancient and modern doctors, the causes of gastroptosis are divided into two categories: congenital and acquired.congenital factors are weak endowments, physical deficiencies, and the day after tomorrow can be summarized as eating disorders, chronic illness or overproduction, and seven emotions.its disease position is in the spleen and stomach, and the main pathogenesis can be summarized as the word virtual and sputum, and the main cause is virtual. or because of the loss of the spleen, the spleen is spleen, the spleen is stagnation, the health is lost, the muscles are not strong, the stomach stagnation loses the sag, or the factors are yin deficiency, the tea is more than the drink, the spleen in the middle of the coke, the water is stagnant, and the stagnation is turned into sip, the blood and blood are not born, and the fascia is dying and drooping. more due to qi deficiency for a long time, blood transport is weak, or long-term illness into the network, blood circulation is impassable, and become bloody.blood stasis is one of the most important diseases in recent years. some people have systematically investigated 67 patients with gastroptosis, and found that 44.8% of them have bloody tongue and 35.8% of them have blood stasis.in addition, fiberoptic gastroscope has also been found to have bloody mucosal congestion or pale mucosa, veins revealed by blood stasis.clinically, it has also been confirmed that the method of activating the blood and removing blood stasis can significantly improve the curative effect. multi-factor yang deficiency, or long-term disease and more prolific breeding and yin blood, five qi qi sputum, causing stomach yin deficiency, stomach veins lost in sputum, slow and not received, causing stomach sag. (two) pathogenesis due to the different causes and primary diseases and physical constitution, the degree of muscle weakness is low, the degree of ligament relaxation is different, the degree of sag is different, and the clinical manifestations are different. for example, those with weakness are often accompanied by sagging organs. the tissue ligaments of the suspended organs and fixed organs are all low tension, while those with chronic wasting diseases or long-term movements are often caused by decreased abdominal muscle tension, insufficient suspension force of the diaphragm and relaxation of the stomach and liver ligaments, often not combined. the whole body is drooping.","['transverse colon sag', 'gastrointestinal motility', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation', 'dizziness', 'depression', 'liver drooping', 'indigestion', 'heart palpitations', 'hypotension']",['insomnia'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
gastroparesis syndrome,"gastroparesis syndrome refers to a group of clinical symptoms characterized by delayed gastric emptying, and no organic lesions in the upper digestive tract or upper abdomen are found in the examination.according to the cause can be divided into two types of primary and secondary.primary, also known as idiopathic gastroparesis, occurs mostly in young women.according to the onset of illness and the length of the disease, the gastroparesis can be divided into acute and chronic.clinically more common, symptoms persist or recurrent often for months or even more than 10 years.","should be given a low-fat, low-fiber diet, eat less meals, mainly liquid, in order to facilitate the emptying of the stomach, because smoking can slow down the gastric emptying, should quit smoking, should try to avoid the use of drugs that can delay gastric emptying.","diabetic patients often have abnormal gastrointestinal motility, and about 40% of patients with type i or type ii diabetes who take oral hypoglycemic agents have gastroparesis. in 1937, ferroir observed that x-ray barium examination of diabetic patients showed weakened gastric motion. in 1945, rundles clearly described the correlation between gastric emptying delay and diabetes for the first time. in 1958, kassander first applied ""diabetic gastroparesis"". a term. gastrointestinal dyskinesia in patients with diabetic gastroparesis is characterized by gastric digestive interval motor complex wave (mmc) phase iii disappearance and postprandial gastric antrum movement, gastric antrum, pyloric and duodenal contraction inconsistency and pyloric fistula in order to delay the emptying of gastric solids, early gastric proximal diastolic dysfunction in dgp patients caused fluid emptying too fast, but the gastric emptying in the late gastric phase was also significantly delayed. the cause of delayed gastric emptying in patients with dgp is mainly due to vagus nerve injury (autonomic neuropathy). hyperglycemia also inhibits gastric emptying. after sham feeding or insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetic patients, gastric acid secretion reaction is reduced, suggesting vagus neuropathy. guy et al found that the morphological changes of the vagus nerve in diabetic patients were severely reduced in the density of unmyelinated axons, and the diameter of residual axons became thinner. in other studies, no abnormalities were found in the stomach wall or abdominal vagus nerve of diabetic patients, and the muscles of dgp patients. there was no abnormal change in the interstitial plexus. ramadylcholine and cisapride could stimulate the gastric antrum contraction in patients with dgp, suggesting that the antral smooth muscle function was intact. gastric fistula is often accompanied by gastroparesis. the delayed gastric emptying rate after vagus nerve ablation is 5% to 10%. after vagus nerve cutting plus pyloric surgery, 28% to 40% of gastric solid emptying is delayed. the vagus nerve stem is cut. gastric diastolic function, gastric antrum contraction, and coordinated pyloric diastolic function are all reduced, leading to accelerated gastric emptying and delayed solids emptying, but high selectivity (wall cell) vagotomy can only prolong the lag phase of solid emptying. and has no effect on total gastric emptying. in patients with peptic ulcer complicated with pyloric obstruction, about 30% of gastroparesis occurred after partial gastrectomy and vagus nerve ablation. the proximal gastric static pressure measurement was performed on these patients, and it was found that the low residual stomach tension is the main cause of gastric stagnation. the reason is that patients with roux-en-y syndrome also have delayed gastric emptying. gastric paralysis after surgery can occur in various types of gastric electrical slow wave rhythm abnormalities and mmc deficiency, and is also associated with delayed gastric emptying. about 80% of patients with anorexia nervosa have delayed gastric solids emptying, but fluid emptying is normal, delayed gastric emptying is accompanied by nausea sinus rhythm disorder, low gastric fundus tension, postprandial plasma norepinephrine and neurotensin decreased concentrations, as well as autonomic dysfunction, but with the same degree of weight loss and no psychiatric symptoms in patients with anorexia nervosa, there was no significant delay in emptying. in addition to causing other systemic organ diseases, these diseases often have diffuse gastrointestinal smooth muscle involvement, causing intestinal motility dysfunction. although esophageal involvement is more common, gastric smooth muscle may be involved and cause stomach paralysis. progressive systemic sclerosis often occurs with delayed gastric emptying. the development of gastrointestinal dyskinesia includes two stages, namely, initial stage neuropathy and muscle lesions due to myometrial fibrous tissue infiltration. dermatomyositis and polymyositis can cause delayed gastric emptying and/or fluid emptying, and the delay in gastric emptying is related to the degree of skeletal muscle weakness. most patients with myotonic dystrophy have delayed emptying of gastric solids and liquid foods. in this patient, the duodenum and proximal jejunal tension increases, and the contractile activity increases. it is believed to be caused by partial depolarization caused by smooth muscle damage. this theoretically increases the resistance to gastric emptying and delays gastric emptying. amyloidosis often has muscle infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract, causing motor dysfunction. in 1956, intriere and brown reported a case of primary amyloidosis involving only the stomach, in addition to myometrial involvement, amyloid neuropathy and vascular disease intestinal ischemia caused by intestinal ischemia is also an important cause of dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract. about 70% of the primary and 55% of the secondary amyloidosis have gastrointestinal symptoms. in some cancer patients, gastroparesis can be part of the cancer syndrome, chinn et al reported 7 cases of lung carcinoid, 6 of which developed gastroparesis, histological examination showed intermuscular plexus degeneration, neurons and axons decreased, inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrated, glial cells proliferated, and submucosal plexus was not affected.libefrski et al recently reported 2 cases of mesenteric artery occlusion, severe gastroparesis in patients with chronic ischemic gastrointestinal disease, accompanied by gastric electrical rhythm disorder and related symptoms. gastric solid row of patients 6 months after bypass vascular grafting the air and stomach electrical rhythm returned to normal and the symptoms disappeared.that is, the unexplained gastroparesis accounts for about 50% of patients with delayed gastric emptying. these patients can be roughly divided into two groups: one group is diagnosed as functional dyspepsia, and the other group is diffuse gastrointestinal smooth muscle involvement. there is a dysfunction of the entire gastrointestinal tract. in addition to gastroparesis, there are often multiple diagnoses such as irritable bowel syndrome or pseudo-intestinal obstruction. about 60% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease have delayed gastric emptying, and it is unclear whether this abnormality is primary or secondary. pathogenesis the etiology of primary gastroparesis, the mechanism is not clear, but the lesion may be in the muscular layer of the stomach or the myenteric plexus that innervates the muscular layer; secondary ones often have: diabetes; connective tissue disease, such as progressive systemic sclerosis (pss); stomach surgery or vagotomy; infection or metabolic abnormalities; central nervous system diseases and certain drugs, in addition, vagus nerve tension and intestinal hormones peptide substances may also play a role, and motilin levels and motilin receptor function may be abnormal during gastroparesis. the cause of gastroparesis may be primary gastric motor dysfunction (esthetic gastroparesis), secondary to some systemic diseases and some stomach surgery hands, gastric emptying mechanism involves gastric smooth muscle, gastrointestinal the intrinsic or external nervous system, the close interaction of the central nervous system and hormones, abnormalities of either factor can lead to paralysis of the stomach.","['upper abdominal discomfort', 'stomach containment

leiomyosarcoma,"leiomyosarcomaofstomach is a malignant tumor originating from gastric smooth muscle tissue. it ranks second in non-hodgkin's lymphoma in gastric non-epithelial malignancies. its clinical manifestations include x-ray barium meal and gastroscopy. lack of specificity, easy to be confused with gastric cancer, gastric leiomyoma and other primary gastric tumors, preoperative diagnosis and differential diagnosis are more difficult.clinically, gastric leiomyosarcoma is not easy to completely remove, and the chemotherapy effect is not good, and the prognosis is poor.gastric leiomyosarcoma occurs mostly from the muscularis of the stomach. it is rare, accounting for only 20% of the intragastric tumors. the gender difference is small, and the average age is 54 years.","because the cause of gastric cancer is not clear, there is no special precautionary method. in addition to diet hygiene, avoid or reduce the intake of possible carcinogens, you can eat more vegetables and fruits rich in vitamin c. for so-called precancerous lesions, close follow-up, early detection of changes, timely treatment.","(1) causes of the disease similar to other stromal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, gastric leiomyosarcoma mainly originates from smooth muscle tissue, and a small part may be of neural origin, and some of it is caused by benign gastric leiomyomas. (b) the pathogenesis of gastric leiomyosarcoma is mostly located in the proximal 1/2 of the stomach, that is, the cardia, the fundus area, followed by the body of the stomach, huge leiomyosarcoma can sometimes affect the entire stomach. 1. gross tumors vary in size and can be single or multiple, ranging from a few millimeters to more than ten centimeters, or even more than 20 cm. generally, the diameter is about 10 cm, which is nodular or lobulated, and smaller leiomyosarcoma is located. in the stomach wall, the appearance is similar to that of leiomyomas. it can be broadened to no pedicle in the stomach cavity, and a few can be pedicle-like. the gastric mucosa on the surface often has ulceration, small and superficial, about 0.2cm in diameter, large. up to 5cm or more, larger tumors often protrude out of the stomach cavity, a few are dumbbell-shaped, and can invade surrounding organs and tissues. it is generally believed that the tumor is nodular, grows into the cavity or outside the cavity, and has a capsule. sexual or large irregular ulcers, mostly leiomyosarcoma, cut surface is light brown or yellowish white, after the formalin fixation is pale brown red, visible braided fiber bundles, and necrosis, hemorrhage and sac sexual change. the tumor is spherical or hemispherical, mainly spreads under the mucosa, and grows perpendicularly to the stomach wall. it can be single or multiple, and some of it is malignant from benign leiomyomas. it occurs in the middle and upper part of the stomach wall to the stomach. more common, followed by the bottom of the stomach. half of the cases have central tumor ulcers, and the blood circulation is rich. therefore, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is often prone to occur after rupture. the tumor can directly invade the surrounding tissues of the stomach, often involving the greater omentum and retroperitoneum, and metastasized by blood, more common in the liver. second, the lungs, lymphatic metastasis is not common. 2. histological characteristics tumor cells are fusiform, similar to normal smooth muscle, rich in cytoplasm, central nucleus, oval or rod-shaped, stained plasmid thick, visible nucleoli, but the number of tumor cells is dense and dense. obviously shaped, the nucleus is pleomorphic, the nucleus is huge and densely stained or the shape and shape are different. the nucleolus is thick, and the multinucleated giant cells are visible. the mitotic figures are more common. the tumor cells are bundled and woven, and the tumor stroma is less. there are glassy changes and mucous degeneration. tumor cells are sometimes arranged in a grid shape, which is similar to schwannomas. the difference between leiomyosarcoma and benign leiomyomas is that the size of the tumor is difficult to judge as its benign and malignant. it is histologically identified mainly based on the heteromorphism of the cells and the number of mitotic divisions. usually, the density of the cells is large without division. tumors with few mitotic figures are called leiomyomas. on the contrary, tumors that are active and pluripotent are called leiomyosarcoma. martin discovered a subtype of gastric leiomyosarcoma in 1960 and called it leiomyoblastoma. in 1969, the world health organization recommended it to be called epidermoid leiomyosarcoma. its histological feature is: the cell is round. shape or polygon, no smooth muscle fiber, vacuoles in the cytoplasm, so there is a translucent band around the nucleus, the tumor cells gather in a sheet, not bundled or braided, these two smooth muscle malignancies except histology, its general morphology, biological behavior, clinical manifestations and prognosis are very similar. shiu et al. subdivided leiomyosarcoma and epidermoid leiomyosarcoma into two types, high malignant and low malignant, according to the morphological criteria of soft tissue sarcoma (table 1). this pathological grade can accurately reflect the prognosis of patients. 3. classification can be divided according to the location of the tumor: (1) intragastric type (mucosal type): the tumor is located under the mucosa and grows into the gastric cavity. (2) gastric type (subserosal type): the tumor is located under the serosa to grow outside the stomach. (3) stomach wall type (dumbbell shape): the tumor grows simultaneously to the submucosa and the subserosal, forming a dumbbell-shaped tumor with a tumor tissue connection in between. 4. the way of tumor spread is (1) blood transfer: gastric leiomyosarcoma is mainly caused by blood transfer, and the metastatic site is more common in the liver, followed by lung and brain. (2) direct diffusion: can also be planted and disseminated, the subserosal cancer tissue can be directly spread to adjacent tissues and organs. (3) planting and metastasis: after the cancer cells break through the serosa, they can be planted on the peritoneum of the abdominal cavity and pelvic organs. (4) lymphatic metastasis: lymphatic metastasis is less common.","['repeated bleeding', 'shock', 'abdominal discomfort', 'upper gastrointestinal bleeding', 'ulcer sputum', 'black stool', 'abdominal pain', 'nausea', 'tumor cell infiltration', 'tumor hard']",['upper gastrointestinal bleeding'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
stomach twist,"the lower end of the normal stomach is fixed by the duodenum, and its morphology is maintained by the gastric spleen ligament, the gastroduodenal ligament, the gastric ligament and the gastric ligament, so it cannot be rotated by 180～.the gastric torsion (volvulus ofstomach) is a fixed mechanism disorder of the normal position of the stomach or its adjacent organ lesions cause gastric displacement, causing the stomach itself to undergo a full or partial abnormal torsion along different axial directions.it can be transient, with few symptoms and can cause obstruction or even ischemic necrosis. chronic gastric torsion patients often have non-specific symptoms such as stomach discomfort, indigestion, burning sensation, upper abdominal fullness or abdominal vomiting, more than post-prandial induction, although patients rarely have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux.acute gastric torsion has a rapid onset, which is manifested as pain in the upper abdomen (infraorbital type) or left chest (squat type). the patient's upper abdomen is significantly inflated while the lower abdomen remains flat and soft.acute gastric torsion often requires surgery.surgical objectives include gastric decompression, gastric torsion reduction, gastric fixation, and correction or repair incentives.","early detection of anatomical and pathological abnormalities that can lead to gastric torsion, and the elimination of such causes, attention to the cause of the disease, early detection, early treatment.","neonatal gastric torsion is a congenital malformation, which may be related to poor rotation of the small intestine, which causes the spleen and stomach ligament or the gastric colon ligament to relax and cause poor gastric fixation. most can be corrected by the baby's growth and development. most of the adult gastric torsion has anatomical factors and is caused by different incentives. the normal position of the stomach mainly depends on the fixation of the lower end of the esophagus and the pylorus. the ligament of the liver and stomach and the ligament of the stomach and the spleen and stomach ligament also have a certain fixation effect on the stomach and small curvature. larger esophageal hiatus hernia, septum, bulge and excessive relaxation of the peritoneum of the duodenal descending segment make the lower esophageal and pyloric parts of the esophageal hiatus difficult to fix. in addition, the sagging of the stomach and the large or small ligaments of the small curved side are loose or too long, which are the anatomical factors of the onset of gastric torsion. acute gastric dilatation, acute colonic flatulence, overeating, severe vomiting, and reverse peristalsis of the stomach can be the driving force for sudden changes in the position of the stomach, so it is often the cause of acute gastric torsion. inflammation and adhesion around the stomach can involve the stomach wall and cause it to be fixed in an abnormal position. these lesions are often the cause of chronic gastric torsion. pathogenesis 1, according to the rotational orientation is divided into (1) torsion along the long axis: that is, the line connecting the cardia and the pylorus as the axis, upturned, this type of rapid onset, closed obstruction, rapid gastric expansion. (2) left and right twist: the midpoint of the curve of the stomach is the axis, which is twisted to the left or to the right, which is chronic or intermittent, and the obstructive symptoms are not obvious. 2, according to the range of torsion (1) complete torsion: in addition to attached to the transverse part, the entire stomach is twisted forward and upward, the big bend is on, between the liver and the diaphragm, the wall behind the stomach is forward. (2) partial torsion: mostly distal to the stomach, partially twisted forward or backward. 3, according to the process of torsion (1) acute torsion: sharp attacks, severe symptoms. (2) chronic torsion: manifested as persistent or recurrent, easily mistaken for gastric ulcer or hiatal hernia.","['myocardial infarction', 'chest pain', 'dyspnea', 'upper abdominal pain', 'triple sign', 'belly sound', 'abdominal pain with shock', 'stomach twist obstruction', 'indigestion']",['stomach piercing'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'surgical treatment']"

gastric and duodenal ulcer bleeding,"gastric, duodenal ulcer combined with bleeding is one of the common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.bleeding is caused by erosion, rupture, etc. of the blood vessels. when the capillaries are damaged, occult blood is found only during stool examination, and when the larger blood vessels are damaged, black stools and hematemesis appear.generally, the symptoms are aggravated before the bleeding, and the upper abdominal pain is relieved or disappeared after the bleeding. invasion of the basal vessels of the ulcer leads to rupture and bleeding, mostly arterial bleeding.the hemorrhagic ulcer is usually located in the small curvature of the stomach or the posterior wall of the duodenum. therefore, the source of gastric ulcer bleeding is usually the left and right gastric artery and its branches, and the bleeding of the duodenal ulcer is mostly from the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery or stomach. the duodenal artery and its branches.the clinical manifestations of massive hemorrhage of gastroduodenal ulcer depend on the amount of bleeding and the rate of bleeding.the main symptoms of the patient are hematemesis and tar-like black stools. most patients have only black stools without hematemesis, and rapid bleeding is a large amount of hematemesis and purple blood.","in order to prevent ulcers and bleeding, the following points should be achieved: 1. life should be regular, pay attention to work and rest, keep a good mood, avoid overwork, mental stress, keep warm during the season change, stop smoking and

and the synthesis of immunoglobulin such as igg is not stimulated by a decrease in plasma concentration. therefore, the plasma concentrations of albumin and igg are the most severe in this disease, making patients with this disease often accompanied by hypoalbuminemia. plasma proteins with fast turnover and short half-life, such as transferrin, ceruloplasmin, igm, etc., are not easily affected, and this disease is only slightly reduced. the fibrinogen has the shortest half-life and the fastest synthesis rate, so the plasma concentration is generally normal. the protein lost into the gastrointestinal cavity is decomposed into amino acids and peptides in the intestinal lumen and reabsorbed into the blood circulation. as a nitrogen source of the body, if the amount of protein lost into the gastrointestinal tract is large, the rate of entering the intestine is faster or the intestinal peristalsis is faster, and a large amount of protein is excreted from the intestine. if the protein is lost from the intestine due to obstruction of the intestinal lymphatics, lymphocytes may be lost from the intestine and blood lymphocytes may be reduced. in addition, other plasma components such as copper, calcium, iron, lipids, and the like can also be lost from the gastrointestinal tract.","['dehydration', 'shock', 'diarrhea', 'lymphatic tube deposition', 'intestinal villus atrophy', 'secretory diarrhea', 'increased permeability of gastrointestinal mucosa', 'gastrointestinal lymphatic return blocked' , 'low proteinemia']",['edema'],"['oncology', 'tumor surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

small intestine injury,"the small intestine occupies the largest position in the abdominal cavity, and the distribution is wide, relatively superficial, and the lack of bone protection is vulnerable to damage. in the open injury, the small intestine injury rate accounts for 25% to 30%, and the closed injury accounts for 15% to 20%. .when any injury to the abdomen needs to be explored, it is necessary to carefully and carefully examine the small intestine.","1, diet should pay attention to, eat less spicy, greasy and other irritating food, eat more light and other foods containing more fibrous substances, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, these can help the normal intestinal peristalsis, making the bowel movements are smooth. 2, exercise properly, do not sit and stand for a long time, actively exercise, promote blood circulation in the body, but also enhance the body's resistance. 3, personal hygiene should pay attention to, the living environment should not be too humid, dark, it is best to wash the anus with warm water every day, keep the anus around clean, personal hygiene products can not be mixed to avoid infection.","(1) causes of the disease small bowel injury is caused by direct violence and indirect violence. it is mainly seen in blunt pubar injuries, rupture of the ileum caused by falling or sudden deceleration. it is generally considered that the rupture site is in the proximal jejunum from treitz. the ligament within 50cm and the distal ileum are within 50cm from the ileocecal area. traumatic damage can be divided into closed intestinal injury, open intestinal injury and iatrogenic intestinal injury. 1. closed intestinal injury can be divided into four situations according to the principle of violent action. (1) direct violence: the anterior humeral anterior humerus is closer to the abdominal wall than other vertebrae. direct violence acts on the abdominal wall and transmits to the lumbosacral vertebrae, causing damage to the small intestine or including the mesentery. under the direct action of strong external force, the intestine is squeezed between the abdominal wall and the spine or the humerus to cause a contusion and laceration of the small intestine. severely, the small intestine can be directly cut off. the injury from the midline of the umbilicus is often injured and the ileum is sometimes accompanied by mesenteric rupture and contusion. bleeding, external force slightly biased to the body axis can be combined with liver, spleen, kidney, colon damage, when the abdomen is subjected to a large area of violence, can be closed due to duodenal jejunum and lower ileum, so that the upper part of the jejunum is closed. hemorrhoids, the pressure in the intestines suddenly increases and ruptures. this kind of damage often occurs after a full meal. the rupture and perforation often occur in the side wall of the small intestine that is far from the intestinal part of the intestine filled with violent compression. (2) lateral violence: external force can also act on the abdomen in the direction of the body axis, so that the intestine can move rapidly along with the mesentery. when the range of movement exceeds the tolerance of the fixed mesentery or ligament, it may cause tearing of the self-adhesive part of the intestine. the predilection is usually found at the end of the jejunum near the treitz ligament or the end of the ileum fixed by the peritoneal reflex. in the same way, this injury can also occur in abdominal inflammatory lesions. abdominal surgery or intra-abdominal medication caused by intra-abdominal pathological adhesions, intestinal and abdominal wall or surrounding tissue, near the organ fixation, from side violence can also cause a partial pressure in the local intestinal tube, the original has been filled with flatulence the intestine can not be used to evacuate external force or there is no room for rotation between the intestines and the intestines. when the fluid pressure in the intestine is sharply increased, the intestine can be ruptured through the oblique passage of the mesenteric wall of the intestinal wall away from the external force. a small perforation occurs, the diameter is generally 0.5 cm, and the surrounding intestinal wall and mesangium are normal, and the damage is easily missed when probed. (3) indirect violence and injury: it occurs mostly under the force mechanism against the inertial movement of the intestine. when the patient falls from a height, falls, and the intestine or mesangial at the time of sudden arrest can not resist the pressure exerted by sudden changes in this position. the small intestine is broken or torn by conduction. this damage occurs mostly at the fixed ends of the small intestine, such as the vicinity of both ends of the ileum attached to the posterior abdominal wall and the free ileum junction where the freeness is most common. the small intestine in a filled state. (4) strong contraction of own muscles: inadequate force caused the body to suddenly recline to make the abdominal muscles contract strongly. the increase of intra-abdominal pressure leads to tearing of the small intestine or mesentery, and some abdominal muscle contraction is caused by the normal movement of the intestine. the abdominal contraction caused by the strong contraction of the abdominal muscles was rare. a total of 76-year-old male patients were admitted to the general hospital of tianjin medical university. because of the heavy lifting of the hands with others, abdominal pain and peritoneal irritation gradually appeared. surgery confirmed that there was a 0.5 cm ileal rupture and mucosal valgus at 150 cm from the ileocecal area. 2. open intestinal injury is mainlycausedby sharp injury, such as bullet injury, shrapnel or marble injury, sharp injury, open small intestine injury must have foreign matter entering or passing through the abdominal cavity, there may be a single single wound injury or more more than one wound is injured, the damaged bowel can be away from the wound site, often causing multiple intestinal rupture or compound damage. 3. intestinal injury in the treatment ofiatrogenic intestinal injuryalso occurs from time to time, common causes such as inadvertent injury to the intestine when surgical separation of adhesions, stabbing of flatulence or highly filled intestines during abdominal puncture, accidental injury of endoscopic operation, and in the case of artificial abortion, intestinal perforation or intestinal rupture occurs in the small intestine, and hematomas are sometimes damaged in the ileum. (b) pathogenesis the pathological changes of small intestine injury are determined by the degree and location of the small intestine and the presence or absence of combined damage. closed intestinal injury the pathological manifestations of closed intestinal injury are contusion of the intestinal wall, hematoma and rupture. when the intestinal wall is contused, the injured intestine has only partial congestion, edema, and the tissue continuity of the intestinal wall is not damaged. the blood supply is still much better. healing, severe contusion can cause the intact intestinal mucosa to lose its proper integrity. the extent of ischemia is more than the degree of collateral circulation compensation. it will eventually develop into ulcers, perforation of intestinal wall necrosis, intestinal contents and bacteria. the perforated intestinal wall enters the abdominal cavity to cause peritonitis, and the contused intestinal wall may also form scarring stenosis after healing. the pathological changes after the intestinal wall laceration vary with the depth and extent of the injury. for simple mucosal laceration without damage to the muscular layer and simple serosal laceration with a small range, it can rely on the body's own repair ability. injury healing, no obvious clinical symptoms and no sequelae, damage to the sarcolemma can be obvious osmotic and inflammatory changes, even intestinal rupture in the injured part, if the mucosal laceration involving the submucosal blood vessels can be local bleeding on the basis of infection and intestinal perforation, the heavier intestinal wall laceration, although there is no serious complications in the early stage, in order to prevent the existence of hidden dangers must also emphasize the therapeutic initiative. the ileum is free in the abdominal cavity compared with other organs, and the chance of hematoma caused by vascular injury is relatively small. however, the upper jejunum and the end of the ileum are relatively fixed, the mesentery is short, and the buffering capacity is lacking. the direct effect of external force can damage the mesentery. arteriovenous or mesenteric arteries and veins and their branches and blood vessels form a hematoma mass, which poses a serious threat to the intestinal wall. a small amount of persistent hemorrhage can develop along the intestine and develop into a large hematoma affecting the blood supply of the intestine. the hematoma can reach a certain level and can break through the slurry. membrane or mucous membrane, severe hemorrhagic shock or death, secondary intestinal ulcer, perforation, abdominal abscess, peritonitis, etc. may occur on the basis of hematoma. 2. open intestinal injury open bowel injury is characterized by simultaneous injury of the abdominal wall and the intestine. sometimes the contents of the intestine are discharged through the wound of the abdominal wall. in the treatment of foreign bodies in the abdominal cavity, attention must be paid to the exit and entrance of the foreign body relative to the intestinal wall. most of the wounds are trajectory of the mouth and bullets. it can sneak a distance in the intestine, resulting in a long distance between the two ruptures on the surface of the intestine. the extent of damage to the large shrapnel is limited. the steel ball bomb may cause up to dozens of intestinal tube damage, small rupture and wide distribution. it is easy to be missed. when the trajectory of the injury is tangential to the intestine, the penetrating substance just stays in the intestine or the strength of the injury fails to reach the other side of the intestinal wall. there may be only one rupture. the pathological changes of open small intestine injury are mainly peritonitis. the small perforation has only a small amount of intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. in addition to local peritonitis, there are other symptoms, the small intestine damage is broken, or the time of visiting the hospital is later, the abdominal wall can be passed through the abdominal wall. the contents of the gastrointestinal tract or the spilled gas flow out of the open wound, and more serious damage may flow out of the blood or damaged intestinal tract, omentum and the like through the abdominal wall wound.","['abdominal tenderness', 'intestinal sound disappears', 'intestines', 'intestinal perforation', 'peritonitis', 'ascites', 'peritoneal irritation', 'abdominal tension', 'disgusting', 'intestinal wall necrosis",['shock'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

congenital intestinal rotation abnormality,"intestinal rotation abnormality refers to the incomplete or abnormal rotational movement of the superior mesenteric artery as the axis during the development of the midgut during the embryonic period, which causes the intestinal position to mutate and the mesenteric adhesion is incomplete, thereby causing intestinal obstruction or volvulus, which is about 6 one in 1,000 newborn babies.most of them develop symptoms during the neonatal period, and a few develop symptoms in infants or children.the incidence of men is twice as high as that of women.","the results of follow-up showed that the surgical treatment was good. although the small mesentery was still free, it was possible to relapse with intestinal torsion. however, clinical experience has proved that there are rare recurrences, but sometimes intermittent abdominal pain, stubborn digestion and absorption disorder, causing anemia, plasma the protein is low, and the nutrient absorption disorder after removal of the necrotic intestine depends on the length and function of the residual intestinal tube. most of the death cases have other malformations.","if the normal rotation of the intestine occurs, obstacles or abnormalities occur at any stage, abnormalities in the position of the intestinal anatomy can occur, and various types of intestinal obstruction can occur, resulting in various complicated pathological conditions. the pathological mechanism of abnormal intestinal position is: 1abnormality ofrotation or rotation of the intestinal tract during embryonic period, including excessive umbilical ring, no rotation of the midgut, incomplete rotation, reverse rotation; 2 intestinal dysplasia; 3 no adhesion of the mesentery, the total mesentery of the dorsal side; 4 due to intestinal dysplasia or mesenteric insufficiency, the proximal colon or small intestine sputum continues to rotate to form intestinal umbilical bulging and abdominal fissure deformity. the types of intestinal rotation abnormalities in the embryonic period are as follows: (1) the midgut unrotated midgut does not rotate when it is retracted into the abdominal cavity, and remains in the original position. the small intestine and the colon are hung on the common mesentery, and the mesenteric root is in front of the spine. sagittal arrangement, often accompanied by (2) intestinal rotation incomplete intestinal fistula rotation after 90 ～, small intestine hanging in the right side of the abdominal cavity, cecum and proximal colon in the left side of the abdominal cavity, appendix in the left lower abdomen, a common abnormal rotation the lower part of the duodenum does not cross the superior mesenteric artery, but is located on the right side of the mesenteric root. there is no duodenal jejunum. the terminal ileum enters the cecum from the right to the left. the ascending colon is in front of the spine or on the left side. the gut, small intestine and colon hang over the common free mesentery. the development of the colon itself makes the transverse colon transverse. the hepatic curvature of the proximal colon extends to the right at an acute angle, and the duodenum and the proximal colon are coiled. (3) abnormal intestinal rotation. the type i intestinal fistula is rotated 180～ and then stopped. the lower part of the duodenum is behind the mesenteric root. the cecum and ascending colon are located in the midline of the abdomen. there is a flaky peritoneal adhesion or cord, which spans the twelve fingers. the front of the second part of the intestine is attached to the posterior wall of the right abdomen. when the proximal colon develops, the cecum is pressed against the duodenum on the right side of the spine in front of the duodenum. (4) intestinal rotation abnormality type ii such as reverse rotation or mixed rotation. 1. after the midgut is rotated 90～ in the counterclockwise direction, it is rotated 90～ to 180～ in the clockwise direction, so that the descending part of the duodenum is located in front of the superior mesenteric artery. 2. the proximal end of the colon moves to the right, and all or part of it is in front of the duodenum and mesentery. 3. when the proximal colon and its mesangium are displaced to the right, the small intestine and mesenteric vessels are wrapped in the mesenteric membrane to form the mesenteric hernia, and the ascending mesenteric membrane constitutes the sac wall, and the small intestine of the capsule may be obstructed. 4. after the midgut rotates 180～ clockwise, the transverse colon runs behind the peritoneum, the small intestine and ascending colon are normal, the transverse colon crosses behind, and the lower part of the duodenum is in front, as the midgut continues to rotate clockwise 180 ～, the intestine torsion is formed with the mesenteric root as the axis, the cecum is displaced to the left, and the duodenum is located to the right.

(3) the zinc salt taste threshold is 15mg/l, the zinc content in drinking water reaches 30mg/l, there is milky white appearance, 40mg/l has metallic taste, 657F2280mg/l can cause vomiting, so it is found that the food has zinc taste should stop. edible.","poisoning is caused by accidental administration of large doses of zinc preparations and inhalation of zinc-containing dust.zinc is commonly found in various foods. trace amounts of zinc are necessary for normal physiological metabolism of the human body, but they are easily poisoned when ingested in large quantities.zinc poisoning caused by food is mainly caused by zinc mixed in the galvanized container or tool, followed by ingestion of a large amount of soluble zinc salts such as zinc chloride, zinc sulfide, zinc sulfate, zinc stearate and the like.","['roughness of breath sounds', 'hepatomegaly', 'sound hoarseness', 'dyspnea', 'abdominal pain', 'lack of strength', 'disgusting', 'mixed acid-base balance disorder', 'proteinuria']",['shock'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
peptic ulcer,"peptic ulcer (pepticulcer) mainly refers to chronic ulcers that occur in the stomach and duodenum. it is a frequently-occurring disease.the formation of ulcers has various factors, and the digestion of mucous membrane by acidic gastric juice is the basic factor of ulcer formation, hence the name.any part of the contact with acidic gastric juice, such as the lower esophagus, anastomosis after gastrointestinal anastomosis, jejunum and meckel's diverticulum with ectopic gastric mucosa, most ulcers occur in the duodenum and stomach, so it is also called stomach, ten duodenal ulcer. recent experimental and clinical studies have shown that factors such as excessive gastric acid secretion, helicobacter pylori infection and weakened gastric mucosal protection are the main causes of peptic ulcer. peptic ulcer belongs to the category of typical psychosomatic diseases. psycho-social plays an important role in the disease, so optimistic mood, regular life, avoiding excessive stress and fatigue, whether in the attack period or remission period of the disease important.","it is very important to remove and avoid the factors that induce the onset of peptic ulcer, such as mental stimulation, overwork, irregular life, unbalanced diet, smoking and alcoholism, etc. peptic ulcers are relieved after drug treatment, and ulcers heal, still need continue to give a maintenance amount of drug treatment for 1 to 2 years, which is of positive significance for preventing ulcer recurrence. hp-related gastroduodenal ulcer is effective antibacterial drug at the same time as reducing gastric acid drugs, eradicating hp infection is also preventing ulcer an important part of recurrence, in addition, gastrinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia, hyperparathyroidism, meckel diverticulum, barrett's esophagus and other diseases can often be associated with peptic ulcer, should be treated in time.","hydrochloric acid is the main component of gastric juice, secreted by parietal cells, regulated by nerves and body fluids. it is known that parietal cells contain three receptors, namely hirstamine receptors, cholinergic receptors and gastrin receptors, which receive histamine, acetylcholine and gastric secretion, respectively. activation of the prime. when the surface cell surface receptor is bound by the corresponding substance, the second messenger in the cell is activated, thereby affecting gastric acid secretion. in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer, excessive gastric acid secretion plays an important role. the amount of gastric acid basal secretion (bao) and maximum secretion (mao) in patients with duodenal ulcer were significantly higher than those in normal people. duodenal ulcers never occurred in people with little gastric acid secretion or secretion. after the chyme enters the duodenum from the stomach, under the stimulation of gastric acid and chyme, the pancreas secretes a large amount of pancreatic secretion, trypsin, and cholecystokinin. in addition to secretory mucus, the intestinal mucosa also releases hormones such as intestinal high. glucagon, gut peptide (gip), vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip), which inhibits gastric acid secretion and stimulates secretion of gastrin, so when the function of releasing these hormones in the duodenal mucosa is reduced, it can cause gastrin and gastric acid secretion to increase, which contributes to the formation of duodenal ulcer. the long-term and repetitive nature of gastric ulcer, the nature of complications, and the tendency of ulcers to heal under conditions of reduced gastric acid suggest that the pathogenesis is similar to that of duodenal ulcer. however, bao and mao in patients with gastric ulcer are similar to normal people, even lower than normal. some gastric mucosal protective drugs (non-antacids) can promote the healing of ulcers, but some damage to gastric mucosa, although they do not reduce the effect of gastric acid. drugs such as aspirin can cause gastric ulcers, and the fact that experimental animals continue to suck mucus from the stomach cavity can cause gastric ulcers, etc., all suggest that the occurrence of gastric ulcers is caused by the local part of the gastric mucosa. due to the destruction of the gastric mucosal protective barrier, it is not effective against the erosion and digestion of gastric acid and pepsin, and ulceration occurs. hp infection is the main cause of chronic gastritis and an important cause of peptic ulcer. in the hp-adhered epithelial cells, microvilli were reduced, cell-to-cell connections were lost, cells were swollen, the surface was irregular, the intracellular mucus particles were depleted, vacuolated, and the adhesion between the bacteria and the cells formed a sticky pedicle and a shallow cup-like structure. under normal circumstances, the physical and chemical factors of various foods and the digestion of acidic gastric juice can not damage the gastric mucosa and cause ulcer formation, because the normal gastric mucosa has protective functions, including mucus secretion, gastric mucosal barrier integrity, and abundant mucosal blood. flow and regeneration of epithelial cells, etc. this degenerative change of the gastric antrum and pyloric region during gastric ulcer can invalidate the contraction of the antrum and affect the advancement of the chyme. delayed gastric emptying may be a factor in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcer disease. certain components of the duodenal contents, such as bile acids and lysolecithin, can damage the gastric epithelium. the duodenal contents can flow back into the stomach and cause chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa. the damaged gastric mucosa is more susceptible to damage by acid and pepsin. in gastric ulcer, the concentration of bile acid conjugate in fasting gastric juice is significantly higher than that in normal controls, suggesting that bile reflux into the stomach may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcer. many gastrointestinal peptides are known to affect gastric acid secretion, but only studies on the relationship between gastrin and peptic ulcer are more common. the role of gastrin in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers is unclear. it has been agreed that the occurrence of peptic ulcer is genetically pleasing, and that gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer disease are genetically independent and irrelevant. in the family of patients with gastric ulcer, the incidence of gastric ulcer is three times higher than that of normal people, and in the family of patients with duodenal ulcer, duodenal ulcer is more common than gastric ulcer. drug factors some antipyretic analgesics, anticancer drugs, such as indomethacin, phenylbutazone, aspirin, adrenocortical hormone, fluorouracil, methotrexate, etc. have been classified as ulceration factors. among the above drugs, there are many studies on aspirin, and the results show that people who regularly use aspirin are prone to gastric ulcer disease. it has been pointed out that the prevalence of regular application of aspirin is about three times higher than that of aspirin. adrenal corticosteroids are likely associated with ulcer formation and reactivation. a group of 5,331 studies have shown that corticosteroid treatment for more than 30 days or a total of more than 1000 mg of prednisone can cause ulcers. in patients with a history of ulcers, the disease can be aggravated. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc., can also inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins to varying degrees, which in theory can produce clinical effects similar to aspirin. lixue et al. have a histamine-like effect, which can increase gastric acid secretion, so it has the potential to cause ulceration. environmental factors smoking can stimulate the increase of gastric acid secretion, generally increased by 91.5% than non-smokers, smoking can cause vasoconstriction, and inhibit the secretion of pancreatic juice and bile and weaken its ability to neutralize gastric acid in the duodenum, leading to twelve the finger is continuously acidified. nicotine in tobacco can reduce the pyloric sphincter tension, affecting its closing function and causing bile reflux and destroying the gastric mucosal barrier. the incidence of peptic ulcer was significantly higher in smokers than in the control group. under the same effective drug treatment conditions, the former rate of ulcer healing was also significantly lower than the latter. therefore, long-term large-scale smoking is not conducive to the healing of ulcers, but can also cause recurrence. food can cause physicochemical properties damage to the gastric mucosa. overeating or irregular eating may disrupt the rhythm of gastric secretion. according to clinical observations, coffee, tea, spirits, spicy spices, kimchi and other foods, as well as partial eating, too fast, too hot, too cold, overeating and other bad eating habits, may be related to the occurrence of this disease. mental factors according to the modern psycho-social-biomedical model, peptic ulcer is one of the typical psychosomatic diseases. psychological factors can affect the secretion of gastric juice. [pathogenesis] 1. excessive secretion of gastric acid hydrochloric acid is the main component of gastric juice. it is secreted by parietal cells and regulated by nerves and body fluids. it is known that parietal cells contain three kinds of receptors, namely hirstamine receptors and cholinergic receptors. (cholinergic receptors) and gastrireceptors, which are activated by histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin, respectively. when the surface cell surface receptors are bound by the corresponding substances, the second messenger in the cells activates, thereby affecting gastric acid secretion, there are two major second messengers in parietal cells: camp and calcium. the receptors in the parietal cell membrane, after binding to histamine, are coupled to an excitatory gtp-binding protein to activate adenosine. acid cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of atp to camp, which then activates a protein kinase that phosphorylates an unrecognized intracellular protein, ultimately resulting in a h+k+-atpase in the parietal cell (also known as a hydrogen ion pump). or proton pump) activates, promotes acid secretion, and acetylcholine receptor and gastrin receptor bind to gtp-binding protein after binding to acetylcholine and gastrin, respectively, and activate membrane-bound phospholipase c, which catalyzes membrane phospholipids decompose to produce inositotrisphosphate (ip3) and diacylglycerol. ip3 promotes the release of calcium from the intracellular reservoir, and then activates h+k+-atpase to promote h+ secretion. acetylcholine also increases the cell membrane to calcium. permeability, gastrin and acetylcholine can promote the release of histamine from intestinal chromoblast-like cells (ecl), which can synergize with histamine. there are still somatostatin substances on the surface of parietal cells. excitatory and inhibitory membrane receptor gi binding, inhibiting adenylate cyclase by an inhibitory gtp-binding protein, thereby reducing intracellular camp levels, reducing the secretion of h+ by parietal cells, and exciting the receptors of parietal cells, regardless of the stimulus. finally, through the second messenger - camp and ca2+, affecting the secretory membrane structure at the top of the parietal cells and the proton pump - h +, k + - atpase, increase or decrease h + secretion. the proton pump is a hydrogen ion atpase that relies on atp to provide energy. it is a counter-transport pump that catalyzes the equivalent exchange of intracellular h+ and extracellular k+. a gradient of 4 million:1 h+ is produced inside and outside the cell, which is much higher than the gradient produced by the proton pump in other parts of the body (eg colon, renal cortical collecting duct). in static parietal cells, the proton pump is present in the lumen vesicles of the cytoplasm. after the wall cells are excited, the tube containing the proton pump moves toward the top of the cell, and the vesicle membrane fuses with the apical membrane. the apical membrane area increases, and the apical membrane retracts to form a secretory canaliculus, which merges into the glandular lumen. the movement of the vesicle is promoted by camp and ca2+, and the fusion of the membrane is accompanied by h+, k+-atpase. activation, on the one hand, increases the permeability of the membrane to cl- and k+. it is not known whether the transport of cl- and k+ on the membrane is achieved by k+, cl- co-operation through the respective channels or through the kcl channel. which mechanism, because k+ and cl- are simultaneously transported extracellularly, h+ and k+ are exchanged under the action of h+, k+-atpase, and finally hcl secretion is caused, and the concentration of hydrochloric acid secreted by parietal cells is constant, which is 160 mmol/ l, ph 0.9, but the ph in the gastric juice is actually 1.3 to 1.8, because there are alkaline mucus and reflux intestinal fluid in the gastric juice. in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer, excessive gastric acid secretion plays an important role. the argument that ※no acid is no ulcer§ is consistent with duodenal ulcer, and the amount of gastric acid basal secretion in patients with duodenal ulcer ( both bao) and maximal secretion (mao) were significantly higher than normal, and duodenal ulcers never occurred in people without gastric acid secretion or secretion. after the chyme enters the duodenum from the stomach, under the stimulation of gastric acid and chyme, the pancreas secretes a large amount of pancreatic secretion, trypsin, and promotes cholecystokinin. in addition to secretory mucus, the intestinal mucosa also releases hormones such as intestinal high. glucagon, gut peptide (gip), vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip), which has the effect of inhibiting gastric acid secretion and stimulating secretion of gastrin, so when the function of releasing these hormones in the duodenal mucosa is reduced, it can cause gastrin, increased gastric acid secretion, and promote the formation of duodenal ulcer. the long-term, repeated nature of the gastric ulcer, the nature of the complications, and the tendency of the ulcer to heal under conditions of reduced gastric acid suggest that the pathogenesis is similar to that of duodenal ulcer, but the patient with gastric ulcer both bao and mao are similar to normal people, even lower than normal. some gastric mucosal protective drugs (non-antacids) can promote the healing of ulcers without reducing the effect of gastric acid. some drugs that damage the gastric mucosa such as aspirin can cause gastric ulcers, as well as the fact that experimental animals continue to suck mucus from the stomach cavity, can lead to gastric ulcers, etc., all suggest that the occurrence of gastric ulcers is caused by the local part of the gastric mucosa, which cannot effectively fight stomach acid and pepsin due to the destruction of the gastric mucosal protective barrier. erosion and digestion, and ulceration occurs. 2. helicobacter pylori infection hp infection is the main cause of chronic gastritis, and it is an important cause of peptic ulcer. in the hp-adhered epithelial cells, microvilli are reduced, cell-to-cell connections are lost, cells are swollen, and the surface is irregular. the mucous particles are depleted, vacuolated, and a sticky pedicle and a shallow cup-like structure are formed between the bacteria and the cells. 3, gastric mucosal protection under normal circumstances, the physical and chemical factors of various foods and the digestion of acidic gastric juice can not damage the gastric mucosa and lead to ulcer formation, because the normal gastric mucosa has protective functions, including mucus secretion, gastric mucosal barrier integrity sexual, abundant mucosal blood flow and regeneration of epithelial cells. there is a mucus layer of about 0.25-0.5 mm on the surface of the gastric mucosa. this thickness is about 10-20 times of the thickness of the surface epithelial cells, which is about 1/2 to 1/4 of the depth of the gastric gland. the mucus forms a non-cell surface. in the unstirred zone, mucus contains mucin, its concentration is about 30 ~ 50mg / ml, most of the water contained in the mucus is filled between the molecules of mucin, which helps to prevent the reverse dispersion of hydrogen ions, stomach surface epithelial cells can also secrete bicarbonate, which is about 5% to 10% of the maximum gastric acid excretion. the process of gastric secretion of hco3- depends on metabolic energy. the action of intracellular co2 and h2o in carbonic anhydrase next, hco3- is produced, which passes through the endometrium of the lumen, exchanges with cl-, and is secreted into the gastric cavity. na+k+-atpase is present in the basal membrane of the cell. under the action of the enzyme, the extracellular na+ is maintained. at a high concentration, na+ is dispersed into the cells, and in exchange, the h+ produced during the formation of hco3- is excreted outside the cell. no matter whether it is mucus or bicarbonate, it can not prevent the gastric epithelium from being harmed by gastric acid and pepsin alone. the combination of the two forms an effective barrier. the mucus acts as a non-flowing layer to buffer. in the mucus layer, heavy carbon the acid salt slowly moves to the stomach cavity, neutralizing the acid that slowly moves to the surface of the epithelium, resulting in an h+ gradient across the mucus layer. with a ph of 2.0 in the stomach, the ph in the mucus layer on the epithelial surface can be maintained at 7.0. the formation of this gradient depends on the rate of alkali secretion and its thickness through the mucus layer, which in turn depends on the rate at which mucus is freshened and lost from the epithelial cell surface into the gastric cavity, any one or more of the above factors. when the interference is disturbed, the ph gradient will be reduced and the protective barrier will be destroyed. 4, gastric emptying delay and bile reflux gastric ulcer disease in the gastric antrum and pyloric region of this degenerative changes can cause gastric sinus contraction, thereby affecting the advancement of the chyme, gastric emptying may be gastric ulcer disease a factor in the pathogenesis. certain components in the contents of the duodenum, such as bile acids and lysolecithin, can damage the gastric epithelium. the contents of the duodenum can flow back into the stomach and cause chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa. the damaged gastric mucosa is more susceptible to acid and stomach. degradation of proteases, the concentration of bile acid conjugates in fasting gastric juice is significantly higher than that of normal controls in gastric ulcer disease, suggesting that bile reflux into the stomach may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcer disease. 5, the role of gastrointestinal peptides it is known that many gastrointestinal peptides can affect gastric acid secretion, but only the relationship between gastrin and peptic ulcer is more, about the role of gastrin in the pathogenesis of ordinary peptic ulcer ,still not clear. 6, genetic factors have now agreed that the occurrence of peptic ulcer has a genetic quality, and that the gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer disease are genetically independent, irrelevant, the family of gastric ulcer patients, the incidence of gastric ulcer is normal the person is 3 times higher, and in the family of patients with duodenal ulcer, duodenal ulcer rather than gastric ulcer occurs more frequently. 7, drug factors, some antipyretic analgesics, anticancer drugs, such as indomethacin, phenylbutazone, aspirin, adrenocortical hormone, fluorouracil, methotrexate, etc. have been classified as ulcerative factors, in the above drugs, on aspirin there are many studies, and the results show that people who regularly use aspirin are prone to gastric ulcer disease. it is pointed out that the prevalence of regular application of aspirin is about three times higher than that of aspirin. adrenal corticosteroids are likely associated with ulcer formation and reactivation, and a group of 5,331 studies have shown that corticosteroid treatment for more than 30 days or a total of more than 1000 mg of prednisone can cause ulcers in patients with a history of ulcers. make the disease worse. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc., can also inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins to varying degrees, which in theory can produce clinical effects similar to aspirin, equal to blood equality the drug has a histamine-like effect, which can increase gastric acid secretion, so it has the potential to cause ulceration. 8. environmental factors smoking can stimulate the increase of gastric acid secretion, which is generally 91.5% higher than that of non-smokers. smoking can cause vasoconstriction and inhibit the secretion of pancreatic juice and bile, which weakens its ability to neutralize gastric acid in the duodenum, resulting in the duodenum is continuously acidified. nicotine in tobacco can reduce the pyloric sphincter tension, affecting its closing function and causing bile reflux, destroying the gastric mucosal barrier. the incidence of peptic ulcer is significantly higher in smokers than in the control group. under the effective drug treatment conditions, the former rate of ulcer healing is also significantly lower than the latter. therefore, long-term large-scale smoking is not conducive to the healing of ulcers, and can also cause recurrence. food on the gastric mucosa can cause physical and chemical damage, overeating or irregular eating may destroy the rhythm of gastric secretion, according to clinical observation, coffee, tea, spirits, spicy spices, kimchi and other foods, as well as partial eclipse, diet fast, too hot, too cold, overeating and other bad eating habits may be related factors in the occurrence of this disease. 9. mental factors according to the modern psycho-society-biomedical model, peptic ulcer is one of the typical psychosomatic diseases, and psychological factors can affect gastric juice secretion.","['ulcer

congenital biliary atresia,"biliary atresia (ba) is a rare and serious jaundice disease in the neonatal period, but it is a major problem requiring surgical treatment of neonatal obstructive jaundice.biliary atresia is not a rare disease, at least half of the cases of neonatal long-term obstructive jaundice, the incidence rate is about 1:8000 ~ 1:14000 surviving babies, but the regional and ethnic differences, the case reported in asia is many, the incidence of the eastern nation is 4 to 5 times higher, and the ratio of men to women is 1:2.","biliary atresia does not require surgical treatment, only 1% survive to 4 years old, but it takes a lot of determination to undergo surgery, which has far-reaching effects on infants and families. early development is delayed, and hospitalization is repeated in the first year. complex problems such as reoperation. surgery can undoubtedly prolong survival, report 3-year survival rate is 35 to 65%, based on long-term survival are: surgery before 10 to 12 weeks after birth ｋ; ｌ hilar bile duct has a large (> 150 m); ｍ surgery the blood bilirubin concentration was <8.8mg/dl for 3 months. in recent years, kasai reported that 221 cases were performed in 22 years. so far, there are 92 cases of survival, 79 cases of jaundice disappeared, 26 cases of over 10 years old, and the oldest is 29 years old. among the long-term survivors, 2/3 cases had no clinical problems, and 1/3 cases had portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. for many years, kasai surgery has been applied as a first-stage treatment step for biliary atresia. after the baby develops and grows, liver transplantation is performed to achieve a permanent cure.","there is no clear conclusion on the cause. pathological examination revealed inflammatory changes in the liver tissue, inflammatory cell infiltration around the hilar and bile duct, microscopic pus or localized necrosis in the hepatic lobule, granulation formation in the bile duct occlusion, and contrast pathology of extrahepatic biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. the study found that the liver tissue lesions were similar, only to a different extent. extrahepatic biliary atresia was mainly characterized by bile duct thrombosis and inflammatory lesions, while infant hepatitis hepatocyte necrosis was more prominent. therefore, it is now considered that biliary atresia may be associated with infants. acquired diseases similar to the pathological process of hepatitis. biliary atresia seen after birth is the terminal stage and outcome of the inflammatory process. inflammation damage causes scarring and occlusion of the bile duct fibers, and the cause of inflammation is mainly viral infection, such as hepatitis b virus, cytomegalovirus, etc., may also be rubella. virus, hepatitis a virus or herpes virus. some scholars have suggested that abnormalities in the confluence of pancreaticobiliary ducts may also be congenital factors in the occurrence of biliary atresia. early thought that the disease is a congenital biliary dysplasia, and is related to the developmental dysfunction or disorder of the bile duct system during the 4th to 10th week of embryonic period. however, biliary atresia has not been found in the anatomy of the biliary system of a large number of abortions or premature infants. there is more evidence to support the formation of the disease. some of the sick children have normal yellow stools at birth, and grayish white stools and jaundice appear only a few weeks later. it also suggests that these patients have biliary obstruction after birth. although the cause of this disease is many, the end result is obstruction of bile excretion pathway and obstructive jaundice. recent studies have shown that the development of intrahepatic and extrabiliary tracts is two sources, which can explain that the biliary atresia can be smooth under the gallbladder. the situation of occlusion caused by lumenal fibrosis above the hepatic bile duct. pathogenesis: the disease is due to biliary obstruction, cholestasis, damage to the liver parenchyma, early liver can be slightly enlarged, and can develop into severe biliary cirrhosis after a few months, the liver is obviously swollen, the texture becomes hard, and the performance is brownish green. it is fine-grained or nodular, and the network can be seen as a network-like gray-white connective tissue hyperplasia. under the microscope, the hepatic lobule is separated and deformed by the fibrous tissue of the hyperplasia. the size varies, the shape is different, and the central vein is misaligned or unclear. the hepatic cell line is disordered, the hepatic sinusoids are dilated or narrowed, the hepatocytes have bile deposition, and are uniformly yellow-stained, fine-grained or coarse-grained. in all cases, hepatocyte vacuolar degeneration, hepatocyte swelling, hepatocyte proliferation and kupffer cell mobilization, intrahepatic pathological changes can be expressed as bile retention 2 to 3 months after birth, cirrhosis, 5 to 6 months of birth, most of the interlobular bile duct destruction disappeared, small bile ducts are not arranged neatly, stenosis or atresia, the neonatal bile duct is significantly reduced, the bile duct is rarely seen in the portal area, the intrahepatic bile duct of the extrahepatic bile duct is open, and the extrahepatic part or complete atresia, due to the site of obstruction andthe pathological changes of biliary atresia are also different. the biliary tract of the atresia is histologically consistent with inflammatory changes. the connective tissue with a little cell infiltration consists of the inner surface covering the granulation tissue. many round cell infiltration and phagocytosis can be seen in the granulation tissue. the tissue cells of the pigment, but the common bile duct has no pathological changes, the histological structure is normal, and the inner lining is cylindrical epithelium. some scholars have found that more than 2/3 of the patients with bile duct atresia have giant hepatocytes. similar to neonatal giant cell hepatitis, it is considered that these two diseases are closely related. hitch listed 8 indicators according to changes in liver tissue structure: 1 hepatic lobular structure changes; 2 hepatocyte cytoplasmic swelling; 3 portal area inflammation; 4 bile fluid stasis; 5 fibrosis; 6 bile duct hyperplasia; 7 giant cell transformation; hematopoiesis.the latter five indicators are significant for differences in bile duct atresia and neonatal hepatitis. electron microscopy showed that there were many different types of electron dense material (edm) in the liver cells, and there were also edm in the cytoplasm of kupffer. some cell membranes were damaged near the capillary tube. the cell gap is irregularly enlarged, and the microvilli are not abnormal. compared with biliary atresia, the edm of the liver tissue of neonatal hepatitis patients is less, the number of capillary bile ducts is slightly less, the diameter of the tube is slightly smaller, and no damage is observed. there are more fluff. at present, scholars have different interpretations of biliary atresia and need to be further studied.","['biliary obstruction', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'biliary cirrhosis', 'diarrhea', 'ascites', 'portal hypertension',

digestive tract repeat deformity,"digestive tract repeat deformity refers to a spherical or tubular cavity mass attached to the mesangial side of the digestive tract and having the same characteristics as the digestive tract. it is a relatively rare congenital malformation.can occur in any part of the digestive tract, but the most common incidence of ileum, followed by esophagus, colon, duodenum, stomach, rectum, etc., reported in 800 cases, the small intestine accounted for 57.4%, the chest accounted for 19.9 %, the colorectal accounted for 9.9%, the duodenum accounted for 7.1%, the stomach accounted for 3.8%, and the chest and abdomen accounted for 1.8%.each organ has its predilection site, such as the esophagus in the right posterior mediastinum, the stomach on the large curved side, the duodenum on the medial or posterior side, the small intestine on the mesangial side, the colon on the medial side, and the rectum on the posterior side. .malformations associated with other systems also have certain rules, such as repeated deformities in the thoracic cavity combined with vertebral deformities such as hemivertebra and spina bifida, and repeated intestinal tracts may be associated with genitourinary malformations.","the disease is caused by abnormal development, so it is impossible to directly prevent the disease against the cause.early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment are important for indirect prevention of this disease, and genetic counseling should be conducted.preventive measures include avoiding the marriage of close relatives, genetic testing of carriers, prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion to prevent the birth of the child.pay attention to regular b-ultrasound during pregnancy to determine the situation.the disease is congenital malformation and there are no effective preventive measures.","(1) digestive tract re-pipeline chemistry: when re-conserving early in the embryo, the intracavitary vacuoles fuse. if some of the vacuoles are not completely integrated with the intestinal lumen, they can develop into a repeating intestinal tract. (2) residual theory of intestinal diverticulum in the fetus: there are many diverticulum-like outer pockets in the early digestive tract of the embryo, which is most common in the distal part of the small intestine. when normal, the diverticulum gradually degenerates and disappears. if there is no degradation or residue during development, it develops. repeated deformity of the capsule. (3) developmental disorders of the notochord: when the spinal cord is formed in the third week of the embryo, adhesion between the endoderm and the ectoderm is caused, resulting in separation of the neural tube from the intestinal tract. due to the endoderm being pulled, the sacral process occurs, and the endoderm when developed into a bowel, this protrusion develops into a repeating digestive tract of various forms. (4) vascular theory: in recent years, many scholars have supported this theory. it is believed that after the development of the fetal gut, the ischemic infarction occurs, leading to intestinal atresia, intestinal stenosis and short intestine.the necrotic residual intestinal tube fragments are subjected to the nutrition of nearby blood vessels, and then self-development can form intestinal repeat deformities.this explanation is also clinically supported, with cases of intestinal duplication with intestinal atresia or stenosis and short bowel. in short, it is generally believed that its pathogenesis is multi-source, and the deformities of different parts and forms may be caused by different causes.","['flatness', 'abdominal mass', 'cystic mass', 'grande silver', 'embryobirth', 'blood blood', 'abdominal pain', 'esophageal repeat', 'stomach repetitive malformation', 'intussusception ', 'peritonitis']",['stomach ache'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
small mesenteric injury,"the small intestine and its mesentery account for a large volume in the abdominal cavity, wide distribution, lack of strong protection, and are susceptible to injury, accounting for about 1/4 of abdominal organ injuries, and the first place in the abdominal organs during wartime.the blunt injury is caused by the violent compression of the small intestine into the lumbar vertebral body. the contents of the extruded intestine are rapidly moved up and down, up to the ligament of the flexor, and down to the ileocecal valve to form a high-pressure closed intestinal segment.the perforation is mostly in the upper and lower 70cm range of the small intestine, occasionally due to indirect violence (high drop, rapid sudden pause in rapid travel), due to inertia, the intestinal tube vibrates violently in the abdominal cavity, and the gas and liquid in the intestinal tube are suddenly transmitted to a certain intestine. hey, the pressure in the cavity increases suddenly, causing the intestine to rupture.a few are caused by excessive contraction of the abdominal muscles or iatrogenic causes.","the mortality of small intestine injury depends on whether the operation is timely and whether there is a combined organ injury. according to the literature, the operation within 12 hours after the injury, the mortality rate is 7.3%, the operation after 12 hours after the injury, the mortality rate is as high as 27.3%, simple the mortality of small intestine injury is below 5%. with the increase of combined organ injury, the mortality rate rises sharply.","the blunt injury is caused by the violent compression of the small intestine into the lumbar vertebral body. the contents of the extruded intestine are rapidly moved up and down, up to the ligament of the flexor, down to the ileocecal valve, forming a high-pressure closed intestinal segment, and the perforation is mostly in the small intestine. in the lower 70cm range, occasionally due to indirect violence (high drop, rapid sudden pause in rapid travel), due to inertia, the intestinal tube vibrates violently in the abdominal cavity, gas and liquid in the intestinal tube are suddenly transmitted to a certain intestinal fistula, intracavitary pressure sudden increase, causing rupture of the intestine, a small number due to excessive contraction of the abdominal muscles or iatrogenic causes.","['abdominal tenderness', 'shock', 'peritonitis', 'internal bleeding', 'tu youbao', 'lower abdominal pain', 'small intestine injury']",['shock'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
neonatal bilirubin encephalopathy,"bilirubinencephalopathy refers to the pathological damage of brain tissue caused by bilirubin. in addition to the basal nucleus of the brain, the nucleus of the hypothalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus are yellow-stained, the cerebral cortex, meninges and endothelium. there has also been a spread in the past. in the past, it was said that huang wei was not comprehensive enough.for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, it must be treated early to avoid the development of bilirubin encephalopathy.failure to prevent early can lead to sequelae or death.","for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, it must be treated early to avoid the development of bilirubin encephalopathy. 1. do prenatal care and health education before birth, try to prevent premature birth, dystocia and infection, and prepare for labor for those who have hemolytic disease. 2, postpartum for newborns, especially premature infants can not routinely use vitamin k3, sulfonamides, sodium benzoate caffeine and salicylic acid drugs, jaundice detection must pay attention to, the visual error of experienced people generally does not exceed 85.5米mol / l (5mg / dl), shanghai neonatal medical engineering professional committee is studying the yellow enamel color palette, there are five different shades of yellow spline fixed on a piece of plexiglass plate, just press the newborn tip of the nose to see what yellow to the extent that the primary doctors and nurses can detect the neonatal jaundice and the estimated serum bilirubin content early, and can be used as the content of bilirubin in hyperbilirubinemia, and can be used as high bilirubin. screening diagnosis and monitoring of blood loss, before the absence of special tools, can also be roughly estimated according to the surface of the jaundice, the general facial yellow is extremely light about 85.5米mol / l (5mg / dl), the trunk is also yellow about 171米mol /l (10mg / dl), the limbs see yellow about 256.5米mol / l (15mg / dl), hands, feet see yellow is higher than 256.5米mol, such as from apricot yellow to golden often exceeds 342米mol / l (20mg / dl ), percutaneous bilirubin analyzer is good for newbornsdynamic observation and screening hyperbilirubinemia jaundice, but expensive, less experienced medical staff for value, because the decision to shake or trace amounts of serum bilirubin measurement is based.","1. excessive production of bilirubin in early life, immature liver of newborns, limited ability to treat bilirubin.the serum does not bind too much bilirubin and penetrates the blood-brain barrier to form bilirubin encephalopathy. 2. the blood-brain barrier is immature in the early neonatal period. in some pathological conditions, the permeability of the blood-brain barrier is increased, and free bilirubin is more likely to pass the blood-brain barrier and form bilirubin encephalopathy. 3. when the plasma albumin level is low, the free bilirubin is increased, and bilirubin is more likely to pass through the blood-brain barrier.form bilirubin encephalopathy.","['hair hearing impairment', 'eyeball tremor', 'clustered', 'breathing difficulty', 'green teeth or tan teeth', 'bradycardia', 'weakness', 'corner arch reversal', 'newborn hand and foot xu move ', 'shocking']",['deaf'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,"congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (chps) is a mechanical pyloric obstruction caused by pyloric ring muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which is a common disease in neonates and infants. most of them are full-term children, and the success of the treatment of pyloric stenosis is one of the great achievements of surgery in this century. there are different morbidity rates depending on geography, seasonality and ethnicity. the european and american countries are higher, about 2.5 to 8.8 R, and the asian region is relatively low. the incidence rate in china is 3 R. mostly male, the ratio of male to female is about 4 to 5:1, and even as high as 9:1. more common in the first child, accounting for 40 to 60% of the total number of cases. there are experiments to give pentagastrin gas to the pregnant dog. as a result, the proportion of pyloric stenosis in the puppies is very high, and it is found that the serum gastrin concentration is relatively high in the third to fourth month of pregnancy, and it is believed that the pregnant woman is in the late pregnancy, due to emotional anxiety, the serum gastrin concentration is increased, and the fetal placenta enters the fetus, and the fetal genetically oriented gene acts to cause long-term obstruction of the pylorus. the pyloric expansion stimulates the g cell to secrete gastrin, thus the disease, but other scholars repeatedly measured gastrin, some reported increased, and some did not change abnormally. even in cases with elevated gastrin, it is not possible to infer whether it is the cause or result of pyloric stenosis, because some cases of gastrin in the case 1 week after surgery return to normal level, and some increase, in recent years, study gastrointestinal stimulating hormone, determine the concentration of prostaglandins (e2 and e2a) in serum and gastric juice, suggesting that the content of gastric juice in children is significantly increased, suggesting that the pathogenesis is pyloric muscle the increase of local hormone concentration in the layer causes the muscles to be in a state of constant tension, which leads to the onset of disease. some people have studied the serum cholecystokinin, and the results are not abnormal. . the pylorus full-thickness muscle hypertrophy, hyperplasia, with ring muscles, muscle fiber thickening and connective tissue proliferation between muscle bundles, hypertrophic muscle tissue gradually migrates to the normal stomach wall, on the duodenum side, due to the gastric wall muscle layer and the duodenal wall muscle layer does not continue, so the hypertrophy suddenly terminates at the beginning of the duodenum, making the pylorus a spindle-shaped mass, 2 to 3 cm long, 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and 0.4 to 0.6 cm thick in muscle layer. the surface is pale and smooth, firm like cartilage, and the mass increases with age. the hypertrophic muscle layer pushes the mucosa inward and forms wrinkles, causing stenosis of the pyloric lumen, resulting in incomplete obstruction, obstruction of gastric emptying and enhanced gastric peristalsis. the stomach wall is thickened, and the stomach is dilated. on the side of the duodenum, the pyloric tube is partially pushed into the duodenal bulb due to strong gastric peristalsis, and the duodenal mucosa is reflexed into a cervical-like pyloric obstruction. after that, the retention of milk juice stimulates the gastric mucosa to produce congestion and edema (figure 1).","drinking water or milk before the test, and the right lateral position is the best way to rule out the gas in the stomach cavity. experts suggest: this disease is a congenital gastrointestinal malformation, no effective preventive measures, drug treatment can not correct the deformity, early detection and early treatment is the key to prevention and treatment, so it is necessary to go to the hospital as soon as possible to perform pyloric ring muscle incision, the effect is better.","(i) causes of the disease in order to clarify the etiology and pathogenesis of pyloric stenosis, a lot of research work has been carried out over the years, including pathological examination, establishment of animal models, detection of gastrointestinal hormones, virus isolation, genetic research, etc., but the cause has not yet conclusion. 1. genetic factors play an important role in etiology. the disease has obvious familial characteristics. even a mother and 7 sons are sick, and the single-oval twins are more common than the double-oval twins. the incidence of children with a narrow history can be as high as 6.9%. if the mother has this history, the probability of a child is 19%, and the woman is 7%. the father has a history of 5.5% and 2.4%, respectively. it is pointed out that the genetic mechanism of pyloric stenosis is polygenic, neither recessive nor non-sexual, but a directed genetic gene consisting of a dominant gene and a sexually modified multifactor. this genetic predisposition is subject to certain environmental factors. and the role, such as social class, diet, various seasons, etc., the incidence of high incidence in spring and autumn, but the relevant factors are unknown, common in high-weight male infants, but has nothing to do with the length of gestational age. 2. neurological function is mainly engaged in the research of pyloric myenteric plexus. it is found that ganglion cells do not mature until 2 to 4 weeks after birth. therefore, many scholars believe that neuronal dysplasia is the mechanism that causes pyloric muscle hypertrophy. in the past, the theory of pyloric ganglion cell degeneration caused lesions, using histochemical analysis to determine the activity of enzymes in the pyloric ganglion cells; but there are also dissidents, the ganglion cells with pyloric stenosis are observed to have no similarities with the fetus, such as the ganglion cell dysplasia is the cause, the premature infants should have more morbidity than the full-term children, but there is no difference between them. in recent years, it is suggested that the structural changes and dysfunction of the peptide nerve may be one of the main causes, and observed by immunofluorescence technique. the number of neuropeptides containing enkephalin and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the ring muscle was significantly reduced, and the content of substance p in the tissue was decreased by radioimmunoassay. it is speculated that the changes of these peptides are related to the pathogenesis. 3. gatrogen hormones there are experiments to give pentagastrin gas to the pregnant dog. as a result, the proportion of pyloric stenosis in the puppies is very high, and it is found that the serum gastrin concentration is relatively high in the third to fourth month of pregnancy, and it is believed that the pregnant woman is in the late pregnancy, due to emotional anxiety, the serum gastrin concentration is increased, and the fetal placenta enters the fetus, and the fetal genetically oriented gene acts to cause long-term obstruction of the pylorus. the pyloric expansion stimulates the g cell to secrete gastrin, thus the disease, but other scholars repeatedly measured gastrin, some reported increased, and some did not change abnormally. even in cases with elevated gastrin, it is not possible to infer whether it is the cause or result of pyloric stenosis, because some cases of gastrin in the case 1 week after surgery return to normal level, and some increase, in recent years, study gastrointestinal stimulating hormone, determine the concentration of prostaglandins (e2 and e2a) in serum and gastric juice, suggesting that the content of gastric juice in children is significantly increased, suggesting that the pathogenesis is pyloric muscle the increase of local hormone concentration in the layer causes the muscles to be in a state of constant tension, which leads to the onset of disease. some people have studied the serum cholecystokinin, and the results are not abnormal. . 4. muscle functional hypertrophy some scholars have observed through careful observation that some infants born 7 to 10 days will force the curd block to pass through the signs of the narrow pyloric canal. it is believed that this mechanical stimulation can cause mucosal edema and thickening. on the one hand, it also causes dysfunction of the cerebral cortex to the internal organs, causing paralysis of the pylorus. two factors cause the pyloric stenosis to form severe obstruction and symptoms, but there are also negative opinions. it is believed that the pyloric fistula first causes functional hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle. appropriate, because the thick muscles are mainly the ring muscles, and the sputum should cause some early symptoms. however, in some cases where the vomiting occurs very early, the mass is usually found, and the size of the mass is not related to the length of the disease. when the muscle hypertrophy reaches a certain critical value, the pyloric obstruction is manifested. 5. the incidence ofenvironmental factorshas obvious seasonal peaks, mainly in spring and autumn. in the biopsy tissue sections, there are leukocyte infiltration around the ganglion cells, which may be related to viral infection, but the blood of the children and their mothers is detected. coxsackie virus was not isolated from feces and pharynx, and there was no change in serum neutralizing antibodies. no pathological changes were observed in animals infected with coxsackie virus. the study continued. the main pathological changes are hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle layer, especially in the ring muscle, but also in the longitudinal muscles and elastic fibers. the pylorus is olive-shaped, hard and elastic, and is more rigid when the muscles are paralyzed. ~2.5cm, diameter 0.5F1cm, muscle layer thickness 0.4F0.6cm, larger in older children, but the size is not related to the severity of the symptoms and the length of the disease. the surface of the mass is covered with peritoneum and very smooth, but due to blood it is partially blocked because of the pressure, so the color appears pale, the ring muscle fibers increase and hypertrophy, the muscles are like gravel hard, the thick muscle layer squeezes the mucous membranes into longitudinal folds, making the lumen narrow, causing mucosal edema, and inflammation later. the lumen is made smaller. on the autopsy specimen, the pylorus can only pass the 1mm probe. when the narrow pyloric tube moves to the antrum, the cavity gradually tapers and the hypertrophic muscle layer becomes thinner. there is no precise boundary between the two, but the boundary of the duodenum is obvious. because the muscularis of the stomach wall is not continuous with the muscle layer of the duodenum, the hypertrophic pyloric mass suddenly terminates and protrudes into the duodenal cavity. shaped like a cervical-like structure, histological examination showed muscular hyperplasia, hypertrophy, muscle fiber disarray, mucosal edema, hyperemia. due to pyloric obstruction, proximal gastric dilatation, wall thickening, increased mucosal folds and edema, and due to retention of gastric contents, often lead to mucosal inflammation and erosion, and even ulcers. (b) the pathogenesis of pyloric full-thickness muscle hypertrophy, hyperplasia, with ring muscles, muscle fiber thickening and connective tissue proliferation between muscle bundles, hypertrophic muscle tissue gradually migrated to the normal stomach wall, on the duodenal side, because the muscular layer of the stomach wall and the muscular layer of the duodenum do not continue, the hypertrophy suddenly terminates at the beginning of the duodenum, making the pylorus a spindle-shaped mass, 2 to 3 cm long, 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and thick in muscle layer. up to 0.4 ~ 0.6cm, the surface color is pale and smooth, as strong as cartilage, the mass increases with age, the hypertrophic muscle layer pushes the mucosa inward, and forms wrinkles, resulting in stenosis of the pyloric lumen, resulting in incomplete obstruction, gastric emptying obstructed to increase gastric peristalsis, thickening of the stomach wall, secondary gastric dilatation, on the side of the duodenum, due to strong gastric peristalsis, the pyloric tube is partially pushed into the duodenal bulb, causing the duodenal mucosa to reflex cervical-like, pyloric obstruction, milk retention retention stimulates gastric mucosa to produce congestion and edema (figure 1).","['dehydration', 'pyloric mass', 'overgrowth', 'pyloric stenosis', 'stomach dilation', 'refusal to eat', 'breathing slow', 'buccal fat disappears...', 'wasting', 'dehydration']",['jaundice'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
anorexia in children,"anorexia in children is very common in children. the main symptoms are vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, abdominal pain and blood in the stool. these symptoms not only reflect the functional or organic diseases of the digestive tract, but also often appear in other systems. when the disease is particularly common in central nervous system diseases or mental disorders and a variety of infectious diseases, it is necessary to inquire about the medical history in detail, closely observe the changes in the condition, and correctly diagnose and treat the primary disease. normal children every 3 to 4 hours of gastric emptying, blood sugar drops, there will be appetite, improper feeding or bad eating habits, such as eating irregular, eating snacks or candy before meals, there is always something in the stomach, blood sugar does not fall, there will be no appetite. western medicine treatment methods in addition to maintaining a reasonable diet, develop good habits, if necessary, can give zinc sulphate 10mg, put syrup or 100g of salt into the 1g zinc sulphate, so that the zinc intake reaches the standard dosage of about daily 10mg, can promote the increase of appetite.","1. reasonable feeding, develop good eating habits, and start from a young age. infants within 4 months are best breast-fed. because related research shows that children who are exclusively breastfed rarely have anorexia. add food supplements in order, don't worry too much. children's diet is mainly based on staple food, and no additional ""nutritional food"" is added. do not use tonics and supplements to make up for your child's nutritional deficiencies, but to patiently explain the taste and nutritional value of various foods. 2. develop good eating habits. regular, press to eat, do not eat snacks (including drinks) before meals, because the rise in blood sugar affects appetite, eat fruit after meals. parents should pay attention to the variety of foods that are often changed, and try not to be the same. animal foods contain more zinc and must maintain a certain proportion in the diet. 3, to maintain a relaxed and happy eating mood. create a good eating atmosphere. let the child eat in a happy mood. even if there are several times when the children are not eating well, don't worry, don't threaten to intimidate the children to eat, and don't beg the children to eat. don't eat a meal, don't worry, don't replenish it with snacks, and eat naturally when you are hungry. when children are unwilling to eat certain foods, adults should consciously and step-by-step guide them to taste this kind of food, neither without principle, nor too much. 4. parents are good examples for children. if the parents are picky eaters or partial eclipses, the child will also be affected, and most of them are also anorexia. therefore, parents must lead by example, not picky eaters and not partial eclipse, giving children a positive impact. 5. actively treat the root cause of anorexia. if anorexia caused by a disease, the appetite will naturally increase after the primary disease is cured.","there are manydifferent causes of anorexia, and there are several types of anesthesia:many acute and chronic infectious diseases have anorexia, especially digestive diseases such as peptic ulcer, acute and chronic hepatitis, acute and chronic enteritis, long-term constipation, etc. can cause anorexia. many drugs, especially antibiotics, can cause nausea, vomiting, such as erythromycin, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, etc. can also cause anorexia, vitamin a or vitamin d poisoning also shows anorexia, some anticancer drugs are more likely to cause anorexia. zinc deficiency often shows anorexia, some endocrine hormones such as hypothyroidism, and relatively insufficient adrenal cortex hormones can also show anorexia. if the summer is hot, it is also the cause of anorexia. this is the most prominent reason at present. the city is particularly obvious. the reason is that the family economy is improving, the market for children's food supply is increasing, the only child is spoiled, the parents lack scientific feeding knowledge, eating snacks, eating cold drinks, and giving ※nutritious food§. high protein, high sugar foods (such as chocolate), in turn, reduce appetite. it refers only to a type of anorexia caused by mental factors. the incidence factors and clinical manifestations are as follows: 1. acute mental stimulation: if the child is strongly scared, the spirit is wilting, the activity is inhibited, the appetite is reduced, and the anorexia is often not too long. long, intimidating, the appetite will be restored in the past. 2, subacute or chronic mental stimulation: leaving a loved one and a familiar environment into the nursery or other new environment, the new environment is not suitable, low mood, loss of appetite, sometimes vomiting after meals, family misfortune or divorced parents. 3. the impact of wrong education: 1 parents are too demanding on children, restrict freedom, prevent playing with other children, or limit where they want to go, affect their emotions, and reduce appetite. 2 parents pay too much attention to children's eating, repeated induction or aversion to threats and anorexia. 4, refractory anorexia nervosa: individual girls anorexia can be very serious, patients are extremely thin, weak, and similar to severe malnutrition, such as low body temperature, cold, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, limbs bun, older girls have amenorrhea, anemia, and are characterized by vitamins and protein deficiency. pathogenesis 1, disease effects: acute and chronic diseases can cause gastrointestinal motility (functional dyspepsia) caused by anorexia, has been paid attention to today, almost all long-term application of antibiotics will cause intestinal flora disorder, micro-ecological imbalance, causing bloating , nausea and anorexia. 2, climate: high temperature, high humidity, can affect gastrointestinal function, reduce the secretion of digestive juice, digestive enzyme activity, gastric acid reduction, etc., resulting in decreased digestive function caused by anorexia. 3, improper feeding: normal children every 3 ~ 4h stomach contents emptying, blood sugar drops, there will be appetite, improper feeding or eating habits, such as eating irregular, eating snacks or candy before meals, there is always something in the stomach if blood sugar does not drop, there will be no appetite. 4, emotional factors: forced feeding, causing children's resentment, a variety of factors affecting children's emotions, can lead to anorexia. 5, refractory anorexia: endocrine examination of children, urinary 17-hydroxysteroid discharge is lower than normal, plasma cortisol content is normal or high, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system response to dexamethasone is inhibited, these changes can also be seen in severe malnutrition. it has been suggested that such patients may have inter-brain-neuroendocrine dysfunction, which is the basis of pathology. in addition, when anorexia nervosa, plasma growth hormone is weakened by hypoglycemia, while other malnutrition is normal or strengthening, the anorexia children's response to levodopa is also impaired. these two reactions are closely related to the function of the hypothalamic system of the limbic system. some authors suspect that it is related to the central nervous system disorder of appetite regulation in the hypothalamus.","['emotional anorexia',

congenital megacolon,"the congenital giant intestine (hirschsprung's discase) is a congenital intestinal malformation in children due to the persistent collapse of the intestines at the distal end of the rectum or colon and the stagnant colon of the feces, which makes the intestine thick and dilated.in children with congenital megacolon, acute bowel obstruction occurs in the neonatal period, and open laparotomy is not uncommon.in the elderly, misdiagnosis of fecal stone when the tumor is open, but also often due to atypical symptoms and delay diagnosis and treatment, misdiagnosis, mistreatment.","the diagnosis and treatment of congenital megacolon has made great progress in recent years. if children can get early diagnosis and early surgical treatment, the long-term long-term effect is satisfactory, but high. some children have more stools or incontinence after surgery. it takes a long time to perform defecation training.","including environmental factors before, during birth, and after birth.some people have reported that some premature babies have ""megacolon"" due to lack of oxygen.hypoxia can cause severe ""selective circulatory disorders"" that alter the function of immature distal colonic ganglion cells in premature infants.it has also been reported that surgical damage can cause megacolon (acquired megacolon). embryology studies have confirmed that from the 5th week of embryonic, the neural tube derived from the neural crest originates from the head to the caudal side along the vagus nerve fibers.the entire migration process is completed by the 12th week of the embryo.therefore, no ganglion cell disease is caused by developmental pause before the 12th week of the embryo. the earlier the pause, the longer the intestinal segment without ganglion cells.the rectum and sigmoid colon at the end are the last evolution of neuroblasts and are therefore the most common lesion.due to the complete absence or reduction of the ganglion cells of the muscular wall of the intestine and the submucosal plexus, the diseased intestines lose their peristalsis, often in a paralyzed state, forming a functional intestinal obstruction, which lasts for a long time, and the upper colon of the obstruction is dilated, the intestine the wall thickens to form the congenital megacolon.as for the original cause of developmental pause, it may be caused by motor neuron developmental disorder in the early pregnancy of the mother due to viral infection or other environmental factors (metabolic disorders, poisoning, etc.). some people think that megacolon genetic factors may be abnormal on the 21st chromosome.the megacolon is a polygenic hereditary disease with genetic heterogeneity. 1. pathological and neuroimmunological histochemical changes typical changes can be seen in the affected intestines of congenital megacolon, namely the obvious stenosis and dilatation, the stenosis is located at the distal end of the dilatation, usually at the junction of the rectosigmoid colon, within 7 to 10 cm from the anus, and the stenosis small, and the diameter of the enlarged intestinal tube is very different, and its surface structure is not very different. it forms a funnel-shaped transition zone (ie, the distal transition zone of the dilatation section) with the enlarged colon junction. this area is originally a narrow segment due to the proximal intestinal tube. peristalsis, pushing the contents of the intestine to move forward, long-term compression promotes the proximal intestine of the stenosis segment to expand into a funnel shape, and the dilatation segment is mostly located in the sigmoid colon. in severe cases, the transverse colon can be spread, and the intestinal tube is abnormally enlarged, and its diameter is increased more than normal. ~ 3 times, the largest can reach more than 10cm, the intestinal wall is thick, the texture is tough as leather, the surface of the intestines loses rosy luster, slightly pale, the colon band becomes wider and the muscle lines are split in longitudinal stripes, and the colonic bag disappears. intestinal peristalsis is rare, the intestine contains a large amount of feces, and occasionally touches the fecal stone. when the intestine wall is cut, the original ring muscle is seen, and the longitudinal muscle loses the normal ratio (2.2:1), even the ratio inverted, the thickness of the intestinal wall is 2 times of the stenosis, the intestinal mucosa is edematous, bright, congested and rough, easy to hemorrhage, sometimes visible superficial ulcer, the main pathological changes of hirschsprung's disease are located at the distal end of the dilated segment in the narrow intestine, the stenosis of the intermuscular plexus (auerbach plexus) and the submucosal plexus (meissner plexus), the ganglion cells are absent. in the distal segment, it is difficult to find the plexus, the nerve fibers are thickened, the number is increased, and the arrangement is wavy. sometimes, although individual ganglion cells are found, the morphology is not normal. the normal nerve plexus is gradually found in the proximal colon wall of the stenosis, and the ganglion cells are gradually increasing. the mucosa glands exhibit different degrees of lesions, and the colonic lamina propria is widened. and accompanied by lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells and macrophages infiltration, sometimes superficial ulcers. hd is a developmental abnormality of the neurons of the enteric nervous system (ens) in the rectum or colon. according to our experimental study, the prominent neuropathological changes are the inner plexus of the intestinal stenosis, and various ens neurons are missing. (no ganglion cell intestine) or significant absence or dysplasia (less ganglion cell intestine), the synaptic network of the intestinal myenteric plexus (auerbach plexus) and the submucosal plexus (meissener plexus) also correspond at the same time, various types of exogenous nerves dominated the widespread disorder. 1 the parasympathetic cholinergic ganglia fibers in the intestinal wall were abnormally hyperplasia, thickening, enzymatic activity, and acetylcholinesterase appeared in the intrinsic membrane. ache) positive nerve (representing cholinergic nerve), with characteristic changes, and associated with clinical symptoms (degree of obstruction), can be used as an important basis for the diagnosis of this disease, 2 walls containing noradrenaline (na) fluorescent sympathetic postganglionic fibers are also increased and thickened, which is characterized by the absence of a normal basket-like plexus synaptic network structure around the lining of the intestinal wall, 3 peptide energy innervation pan-disorder; the inner wall of the wall is missing any peptide-energy neurons; the substance p (sp) in the intestinal wall, the enkephalin (enk) fibers are reduced, and the myenteric plexus (muscle space or muscle bundle) and the mucosal layer, a large number of thickened vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip), calcitonin gene releted peptide (cgrp), somatostatin (sdm) and neuropeptide y (neuropeptide y, npy) fiber bundles or small nerve trunks or fiber webs, npy dominates overgrowth, but the latter four peptides in the submucosal vessels are significantly reduced or absent, 4 contains nitric oxide (nitricoxide, no) the neuronal component changes in the colon segment of the ganglion-free cell, similar to vip, 5 contains serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-th) neuronal component, in the intestinal plexus without ganglion cells the end of the network and the nerve fiber bundles in the muscle layer are significantly reduced. the changes in the above-mentioned various neural components in the colon of the disease mainly involve motor neurons, and also have an effect on mucosal secretion and sensory innervation. is caused by acetylcholine (ach), sp, enk, cgrp and npy (excitatory neurotransmitters, stimulated contractile muscle contraction) with na, vip, som and no (inhibitory neurotransmitters, inhibition of intestinal muscle movement) participating in the regulation of colonic motor dynamics out of control, has become a neurochemical and pathological physiology of the disease without ganglion cell stenosis. 2. pathophysiology the movement mechanism of the colon and internal sphincter is very complicated. the traditional concept is that its innervation is sympathetic and parasympathetic. the former inhibits smooth muscle, ie relaxes; the latter excites smooth muscle, ie, contraction. the sphincter has the opposite effect. the ganglion in the colon wall is considered to be the parasympathetic nervous system. in recent years, the innervation of the colon and the internal sphincter has been learned through clinical pathology, histochemistry, electron microscopy, drug reaction tests, and animal experiments. it is divided into 3 parts and has been as described above. the pathological change of hirschsprung's disease is due to the absence of ganglion cells in the stenotic segment of the intestine. okamoto eiji (1988) confirmed that no connective point (none) between the nerve and the muscle was found in the diseased intestine, and the neurotransmitter was affected. when quantitatively determined, it was found that the content of either cholinergic receptor or adrenergic beta receptor was significantly lower than that of the normal intestinal segment, resulting in lesional intestinal and internal sphincter spasm stenosis and lack of normal peristaltic function, forming functional intestinal obstruction. the parasympathetic preganglionic fibers that should establish synaptic connections with ganglion cells are proliferated and thickened in the intestines of ganglion-free cells, and the fibers after sympathetic ganglia are also significantly increased. a large amount of acetylcholine is considered to be the main cause of intestinal spasm. one of the reasons is that after the lack of cholinergic ganglion cells, normal segmental movement and rhythmic propulsive peristalsis are blocked, and the parasympathetic nerve from the ankle directly acts on the intestinal wall muscle cells, thus making the diseased intestinal tube persistent. tonic contraction, in addition, due to the absence of ganglion cells, the hyperplastic sympathetic nerves interrupt the original inhibitory pathway, and can not affect the gallbladder by beta inhibitory receptors. the nerve can produce relaxation of the intestinal wall, but directly reaches the 汐-excited receptor of the smooth muscle to produce sputum. the non-cholinergic non-adrenergic system in the wall also inhibits the neuron deficiency, thus losing the effective relaxation function due to the rectum. the internal sphincter remains in a state of continuous contraction, which causes the normal propulsive wave of the intestine to be blocked. finally, fecal retention, bloating, and stool can not be discharged. it can be seen that the normal peristaltic wave of the colon cannot be transmitted, and the ganglion cell is not lacking ganglion cells. in particular, the number of sympathetic nerves is also reduced, which is almost completely in a state of no innervation (cannon's law), leading to ankylosing contracture of the intestines. for a long time, the proximal normal intestinal segment is exhausted and compensatory. the hair expands hypertrophy, and the ganglion cells also undergo degeneration and degeneration until they shrink, so that they decrease or disappear. swenson placed the balloon into the colon and recorded the peristalsis of each segment of the intestine. it was found that the normal intestine was completely different from the diseased intestine. the former had a significant increase in contraction when the bowel movement entered the sigmoid colon. in the absence of the ganglion cell, the intestinal peristalsis was transmitted to the sigmoid colon. there is no contraction wave. this phenomenon can explain the constipation and obstruction symptoms of the child. as the age of the sick child increases, the intestinal tube enlarges and the constipation progresses progressively, while the secondary lesion has a longer extension. so as to spread to the proximal colon or small intestine. the result of such long-term chronic obstruction will inevitably lead to poor appetite, nutritional malabsorption, poor growth and development, anemia, hypoproteinemia, etc. after the bacterial flora in the intestines causes dysbacteriosis, the absorption of toxins will cause heart and liver. the kidney function is impaired and finally died due to low resistance to infection or perforation of enteritis.","['no calf stools', 'brain hydrops', 'gut sounds', 'tension', 'colon vascular dysplasia', 'appetite loss', 'frog-shaped abdomen', 'dehydration', 'large bowel disease']",['intestinal obstruction'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
pediatric vomiting,"vomiting is one of the common symptoms in children. if you do not get timely and correct treatment, it will affect the intake of nutrients in the children. in severe cases, it will cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.vomiting is a kind of reflex action that the contents of the stomach are reversed into the esophagus and spit out through the mouth.it can be divided into three stages, nausea, retching and vomiting, but some vomiting can be a precursor to nausea or retching.","1. let the child lie on his side to prevent vomiting. 2, the drug should not be too hot when administered, medication should be slow, can be used in a small number of times, if necessary, can take a bite, stop, and then serve. 3, actively identify the cause of vomiting, for the treatment of the cause.","nausea refers to non-mandatory solution or gastrointestinal secretion of gastric contents from the stomach or esophagus phenomenon out of the estuary are not usually accompanied by nausea or abdominal contraction mandatory, nausea can be physical in nature, but also by pathological reasons cause. infants with a few weeks of priming can see that there is milk in the mouth (with or without milk) about 0.5 to 1 hour after the upgrade. it is usually called ※overflowing milk§. the appetite, sleep, spirit and weight gain of the baby are normal, often significant incentives can be found, and there is no need to deal with it naturally within 7-8 months. 1. feeding problem refers to ※vomiting§ caused by improper feeding techniques, such as incorrect posture during breastfeeding (such as nipple, poor connection between areola and baby's mouth, close contact with the nose, incorrect posture, etc.), milking fast, the milk speed is almost the baby sucking and swallowing too fast, the amount of milk is too much, the teat is invaginated, the sucking difficulty is low, the milk temperature is low when the artificial feeding is too small, the diameter of the teat hole is too small, or the heat card in the milk is insufficient and the feeding is less, the baby there are often non-nutritive sucking and there is a lot of odor in the stomach. after the milk, there is no gas in the standing position. after the milk, the gas in the stomach is not discharged, or the baby is given various cares after the milk (changing the diaper, taking a bath, feeding medicine, etc., can not be chewed to solid food in infants, forced infants, especially premature infants to eat, crying before and after eating can cause. 2, congenital esophageal obstruction, relying on x-ray examination diagnosis. (1) intraluminal and tube wall, complete and incomplete obstruction caused by abnormal structure of the esophagus itself. 1 congenital esophageal atresia: esophageal atresia is a congenital malformation of unknown cause, clinically not very rare, 1 case of about 4,000 live births, esophageal atresia may or may not be combined with esophageal tracheal fistula, but often complicated by the spine, anal, heart, kidney and limb malformations, generally divided into five types, namely type i (blind end of the esophagus, blind end, no esophageal tracheal fistula), type ii (the proximal end of the esophagus has a fistula connected to the trachea, the distal end is blind end, lower and stomach pass), type iii (the end of the esophagus is blind, the distal end is connected with the trachea), type iv (esophageal atresia, but the upper and lower segments are connected by the fistula and trachea) and v-type (esophageal patency, but somewhere there is a fistula and tracheal traffic from the bottom to the top) or n-type, of which type iii is the most common, accounting for more than 90%, followed by type i, only 5% to 7%. children with congenital esophageal atresia have obvious difficulty in swallowing. in the early postpartum period, the mouth is foaming, the milk is sweating, and it is sprayed from the mouth or nostrils. because the milk does not touch the stomach acid, the spit does not contain milk clots. bile, newborns often suffer from dyspnea and purpura due to aspiration, and obviously improve after sucking ""sputum"". such recurrent episodes, early secondary pneumonia and life-threatening, the diagnosis mainly depends on the insertion of no. 10 rubber or silicone tube in the food. standing x-ray film. 2 congenital esophageal stenosis: rare, the cause is unknown, there are various theories, according to histology can be divided into three types: that is, a certain section of the esophageal wall hypertrophy, membrane or diaphragm and intratracheal bronchial cartilage residual, the clinical manifestations of the diaphragm type similar to esophageal atresia, esophagoscopy can be diagnosed at the same time. children with esophageal stricture often have vomiting when eating food supplements for several months after birth, difficulty in swallowing, aspiration, repeated respiratory infections, weight loss and malnutrition, x-ray esophagus contrast and endoscopy can be diagnosed, but more common in the 1/3 or lower esophageal cartilage remains in surgery or pathological diagnosis, this disease may be associated with congenital esophageal atresia. 3 congenital esophageal duplication: in the congenital digestive tract repeat deformity, its incidence is second only to the ileum, clinical is not uncommon, can be expressed as cysts, tubular or diverticulum-like, more common in the lower right esophageal mediastinum, and there were vertebral body malformations or intramedullary masses in the spinal cord. there were statistics in 8 of the 65 patients (12.3%) with intra-abdominal repeat deformity, sometimes without any symptoms, only found in the occasional x-ray examination of the chest. some of the respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheezing, pneumonia, hemoptysis and chest pain are the main complaints. about 15% of the sick children have dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain and blood in the stool, relying on the x-ray positive lateral chest and abdomen plain film. esophageal angiography, b-ultrasound or color doppler ultrasound, ct, radionuclide and magnetic resonance imaging can be diagnosed before operation. when spinal tube tumors are suspected, spinal canal angiography is required. attention should be made to distinguish lymphoma, neurogenic tumor and hemangioma. . 4 achalasia (sickness, idiopathic esophageal dilatation): the cause is unknown, there are statistics in 167 pediatric cases, 5.3% of newborns, cholinergic nerve dysfunction from the esophageal wall, causing contraction of the lower esophageal muscle the lower esophageal sphincter pressure rises, the food stays in the food, gradually expands, the inflammatory changes of the mucosa and ulcer formation, the degree of difficulty in swallowing varies, progressively worsened, sometimes affected by mental factors, the content is milk without milk clot juice or undigested food is refluxed or spit out from the esophagus to the mouth, sometimes containing brown mucus. after a long time, there is weight loss, anemia and malnutrition. children can complain of heartburn or chest pain caused by digestive esophagitis. x-ray photo plus meal contrast can be diagnosed, esophagoscopy and manometry are applied gradually. 5 gastroesophageal reflex (ger) refers to the phenomenon that the stomach and part of the duodenum contents flow back into the esophagus. in addition to the physiological part of the child, it disappears about 8 to 10 months after birth, and other pathological conditions. it can cause serious complications. this disease is one of the hotspots in pediatric surgery research at home and abroad in recent years. the reasons are complex and diverse, mainly due to the abnormally lower continuous esophageal sphincter (lesp) in the lower esophagus. other factors such as larger his angle, diaphragmatic elasticity, abdominal pressure, esophageal mucosal folds, gastric volume and other factors reduce the anti-reflux barrier function of the esophagus, decrease the esophageal clearing ability, and cause abnormal function of the stomach and duodenum. gastroesophageal reflux occurs. flow, which leads to inflammatory changes in the esophageal mucosa, ulcers, hemorrhage and stenosis. some people think that 50% of ger is in the neonatal and infancy, 60% to 80% of them have vaginal vomiting within one week after birth, 40% have pyloric stenosis, sputum can contain bile and brown bloody fluid, and older children can have sternum post-burning, swallowing pain, difficulty swallowing and wheezing, asthma, asphyxia and chronic respiratory infections, according to statistics, 25% to 80% of asthmatic children, 46% to 63% of chronic respiratory diseases with ger some diseases related to neuropsychiatric factors, such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, ruminating and head and neck, sandifer syndrome in different upper body postures, ger, blood in the stool, anemia, chronic malnutrition, after some esophageal atresia, even children with growth retardation can occur. x-ray esophagus and gastric sputum angiography are commonly used in the diagnosis of ger. it can be diagnosed and divided into light and heavy. it is diagnostic when measuring lesp<1.96kpa (20cm h2o). in recent years, wang weilin used esophagogastric double ph. the microelectrode was used to monitor the pediatric standing and lying fasting (excluding meals and 2 hours later) and 24 hours. results: acidic gastroesophageal reflux refers to the esophageal ph<4 time exceeding 4% of the total monitoring time. in the fasting stomach, gastric ph>4 is an alkaline reflux standard, gastric ph>7, is alkaline gastroesophageal reflux, such as gastric ph>4, esophageal ph<7, it is alkaline gastroesophageal reflux, the conclusion is that : gastroesophageal reflux on the basis of duodenogastric reflux is one of the main types of gastroesophageal reflux in children. the double ph monitoring of gastroesophageal segment in fasting and lying position is more meaningful in pathological reflux. . in addition, endoscopy, isotope scanning and ultrasound examinations also contribute to comprehensive judgment and differential diagnosis. 6 esophageal hiatus hernia: this disease is a more common congenital malformation, esophageal hiatus is abnormally wide due to dysplasia of the diaphragm, when the supine or abdominal pressure rises, the fundus, cardia and part of the esophagus slide into the mediastinum, resulting in stomach content reflux into the esophagus, causing mucosal inflammation, even ulcers and hemorrhage, and finally forming scar stenosis, sick children vomiting food, may contain brown or red blood, supine and nighttime aggravation, eventually esophageal stricture, difficulty swallowing, anemia and malnutrition, respiratory symptoms such as cough, asthma and inflammation can be caused by mistakes. in severe cases, apnea or sudden death can be diagnosed mainly by x-ray sputum angiography of esophagus and stomach. lipiodol and diatrizoate are used to prevent sputum in young infants. aspiration, small babies to change position and increase food viscosity can significantly reduce vomiting. 7 congenital short esophagus: very rare, the cardia and part of the fundus in the mediastinum, due to pressure caused by dysphagia, gastric reflux, causing esophageal inflammation and ulcers and ""vomiting"" blood, x-ray barium angiography can confirm the diagnosis, attention and esophagus the difference between the hiatus. (2) extraluminal, the esophageal pressure caused by congenital diseases outside the esophagus, unobstructed by the cheating, and swallowing after eating, especially when eating solid foods, it is difficult to swallow, at this time there may be vomiting, aspiration or asphyxia, which can be seen in cases of congenital vascular annulus around the esophagus, is rare in clinical practice. 1, esophageal inflammation and stenosis: due to a variety of congenital and acquired diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux, achalasia, pneumonia, scarlet fever, diphtheria, helicobacter pylori infection, asthma and other sick children repeatedly vomiting, stomach acid stimulation food mucosal inflammation, ulcers and stenosis, emergencies of nausea or vomiting, as well as common children who are mistakenly taken care of household alkaline water, alkaline liquids in batteries or industrial strong acid and alkali, causing corrosive liquids such as acute food mucosa or (and) muscles layer damage, causing inflammation, perforation or stenosis. 2, esophageal foreign bodies such as coins, pins, fish bones, melon seeds, peanuts, beans, jujube nucleus, plastic toys, etc., light can cause saliva, poor pharyngeal and vomiting: severe cases can cause burning sensation and pain after the sternum, even perforation, abscess formation, can form esophageal fistula after rupture, in young children can also be difficult to breathe due to foreign body pressing the trachea forward. 3, the cause of post-esophage abscess has a posterior pharyngeal wall abscess, a variety of causes of esophageal perforation, secondary abscess, mediastinal lymph abscess, tracheotomy tube compression ulcer and spinal tuberculous abscess, etc., due to oppression obstruction, dysphagia or pain and nausea and vomiting, as well as reports of local tracheobronchial lymph node inflammation adhesion, local esophageal dilation, pseudo-dip chamber formation, food retention, mucosal inflammatory changes, causing nausea. 4, trauma: esophageal trauma in addition to foreign body causes, mostly iatrogenic, such as endoscopy and injection treatment of esophageal varices, accidental injury, insertion of gastrointestinal decompression tube or artificial ventilation, etc., at this time vomit is often bloody according to the medical history, x-ray angiography and photographs are not difficult to diagnose. when there is foamy liquid in the chest drainage tube after esophageal atresia endoscopic anastomosis, the anastomotic leakage is often indicated, and the oral cavity of the sick child may also have foamy mucus reflux. 5, ruminant: domestic literature is rarely reported, more common in 3-4 months, the baby will swallow the food after swallowing and then swallow, they look up, tongue and jaw, rhythmically chew and swallow until there is reflux, this some foods are spilled out of the mouth, while others are swallowed. the baby's mood is good and alert. parents often complain of vomiting or weight loss, sometimes when the mother is frightened by the baby's illness, depressed or unable to intervene. infants with low mental retardation or mental dysfunction can show persistent rumors, at which point nurses or others can recover from the care and care of the baby. 6. others: when the intra-abdominal pressure rises due to swelling of the tumor, ascites, organ enlargement, and difficulty in breathing due to difficulty in breathing, the sputum is swollen, the lower esophagus or stomach is distorted, and reflux may occur after neonatal anesthesia is withdrawn. or nausea. (2) vomiting means that the contents of the stomach or part of the small intestine are forcibly discharged through the mouth, often accompanied by nausea and strong abdominal muscle contraction. the many causes of vomiting can be divided into three major categories: obstructive, reactive and central. the former is often a surgical cause, and the latter two are caused by medical diseases. 1. obstructive vomiting can be caused byobstruction of thedigestive tract by congenital gastrointestinal malformations or certain acquired diseases. 1) congenital gastrointestinal malformations: including intraluminal atresia, stenosis or wall dysplasia or extravascular compression. in neonates, this is the main cause of surgical vomiting. the digestive tract has food atresia from top to bottom. gastric torsion, pyloric fistula, pyloric hypertrophic stenosis, pyloric valve, duodenal atresia or stenosis, annular pancreas, poor intestinal rotation, ileal atresia or stenosis, intestinal ganglion syndrome (megacolon), megacolon disease, rectal anal malformation (including anal atresia or stenosis and sometimes combined rectal urinary fistula, rectal vaginal fistula, rectal vestibular fistula, acupoint anus, etc.) and digestive tract repeat deformity, in addition, small left colon syndrome, giant bladder small colonic intestinal peristalsis syndrome is rare, as well as gastric wall muscle dysplasia with gastric perforation, meconium obstruction syndrome, meconium peritonitis is not very rare clinically, meconium intestinal obstruction is rare in all ethnic groups in china. intestinal wall compression can be caused by congenital duodenum, anterior dysplasia, fibrous membrane or cord, meconium peritonitis adhesion, duodenal anterior portal vein, mesenteric hiatus hernia, incarcerated inguinal hernia or transverse diaphragm caused by the disease, esophageal hiatus hernia is also caused by malformation caused by incomplete gastrointestinal obstruction and vomiting. 2) caused by acquired digestive tract diseases: such as adhesion of intestines or abdominal inflammation, acute intussusception (in cecal, kinky or retrograde type), common foreign body (hair group, stomach stones, etc.) and rare sigmoid torsion premature infants can be seen with milk clot intestinal obstruction, children can cause abdominal pain and vomiting due to constipation, accompanied by urinary retention, aphid intestinal obstruction and intestinal torso are only due to the widespread application of chemical fertilizers in large and medium cities rare. due to the different causes of intestinal obstruction, the course of disease is different (acute or chronic), the nature is different (complete, incomplete or sudden) and the location of the lesion is different (high, medium or low), so the time of vomiting there are significant differences in clinical manifestations such as nature, content, color and quantity, and the etiology is closely related to age. 2, reflex vomiting is caused by biological, physical or chemical stimuli in the gastrointestinal tract, sometimes caused by a mixture of various factors. 1), internal medicine (1) swallowing syndrome: neonatal swallowing amniotic fluid, maternal blood, meconium, etc. during the labor process, spit after birth, more than 1 to 2 days of self-healing. (2) when the infant's respiratory tract infection occurs, the mucus of the nasopharynx causes a mouth-mouth reflex, or occasionally the edema of the edema or the finger is injected into the mouth. (3) children's respiratory and digestive tract viruses, bacteria, and even mycoplasma and fungal infections are extremely common causes. acute upper respiratory tract infections in various age groups, pneumonia and certain other infectious diseases such as whooping cough can cause abdominal wall due to severe cough. and diarrhea, dyspepsia, acute gastroenteritis, infectious diarrhea, viral hepatitis and other gastrointestinal disorders and vomiting symptoms in neonatal and preterm infantile necrotizing enterocolitis are more common, even as this is the main complaint is to see a doctor. when the newborn is tetanus, it can refuse vomiting. (4) allergic diseases: such as the addition of gluten food, allergic purpura caused by intestinal cramps. (5) peptic ulcer: common helicobacter pylori infection, late pyloric obstruction caused by ulcer scar can cause obvious vomiting. (6) food, drugs and chemical poisoning: ipecac, digitalis, theophylline, salicylate, removal of anesthetic, iodine preparation, mustard, lentils and carrion poisoning, etc., also cause vomiting when feeding infants . (7) metabolic and endocrine disorders: such as adrenal insufficiency, acidosis, phenylketonuria, fructoseemia, hereditary tyrosinemia, galactosemia, etc. 2), surgical (1) inflammation of the digestive tract organs, perforation and peritonitis: such as gastric or duodenal ulcer or trauma, tumor caused by perforation, acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis. (2) ischemic enteritis: can be caused by vascular disease or insufficient blood flow, such as superior mesenteric artery syndrome, intestinal reversal caused by various reasons (intestinal dysplasia of newborn or small infant combined with midgut torsion, aphid intestine abdominal obstruction, mesenteric hiatus, volvulus, etc.) and hypovolemic shock, stomach and intestinal muscles cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. (3) gastrointestinal organ bleeding: such as acute, chronic ulcer bleeding, esophageal varices, hemangioma or vascular malformation caused by a large number of bleeding. 3) genitourinary diseases: such as acute pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, renal insufficiency, uremia, hydronephrosis, urinary calculi; girl's ovarian cyst torsion, dysmenorrhea in older girls. 4) otolaryngology and ophthalmology diseases: otitis media with labyrinthitis, motion sickness, meniere's disease, etc., with glaucoma with headache and vomiting. 5) others: such as gastroparesis syndrome, is an idiopathic gastric neuromuscular disease, the cause is unknown, can be found in diabetes, connective tissue disease, uremia, postprandial discomfort after meals, intermittent nausea, delayed vomiting, stomach raft empty delay, chronic pseudo-intestinal paralysis (chronic pseudo-intestinal obstruction) has a variety of theories, also known as muscle or / and neurological disorders, diarrhea and constipation in addition to bloating and vomiting, reported in hypothyroidism, in patients with scleroderma, amyloidosis, down's syndrome, and cytomegalovirus infection, reflex vomiting is also seen in radiation and chemotherapy during neonatal disease. 3, central vomiting 1) central nervous system disorders: the vast majority of central vomiting, it can be increased by intracranial pressure (cerebral edema, brain tumors, aneurysms, sun, etc.), inflammation (encephalitis, cerebrospinal membrane inflammation, brain abscess, subdural effusion), craniocerebral injury (intracranial hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, cerebral palsy, cerebral hypoxia, meningocele, etc.) and toxic encephalopathy (pneumonia , toxic enteritis, sepsis) and other diseases. 2) others: lead poisoning, hypoglycemia, mountain sickness, mental vomiting caused by school or family conflicts, periodic vomiting, anorexia nervosa, hunger and autonomic dysfunction (intestinal fistula, paroxysmal tachycardia), etc. can cause vomiting. (1) pathogenesis vomiting is a type of neuroreflex, a process that is extremely complex, with external or endogenous organisms received by peripheral organs and tissues, physical and chemical stimuli, transmitted through the somatic and splanchnic nerves or blood circulation to the central nervous system, in the medulla oblongata. the vomiting pivot (accepting impulses from the gastrointestinal tract and other visceral nerves) and the posterior polar region at the bottom of the fourth ventricle, the chemoreceptor trigger zone (ctz) (accepting chemical and drug stimuli from the blood circulation), reflection signals pass through the vagus nerve and spinal nerves to the corresponding organs to cause vomiting. recent studies have shown that dopamine receptors play an important role in the mediated vomiting of ctz. ctz also contains serotonin, norepinephrine, substance p, brain. some of these endogenous neurotransmitters and neuropeptides can cause vomiting through blood circulation or direct action on ctz, such as morphine and gamma aminobutyric acid. swallowing activity refers to the movement of food from the pharynx to the stomach. it is a series of nerves (both and autonomic, autonomous and non-autonomic, central and peripheral), muscle (striated and smooth muscle, voluntary muscle and involuntary). muscle), a complex physiological process in which multi-phase (chemical, physical) activities are coordinated, in which any organic or functional disorder can cause dysphagia or other abnormalities (including vomiting). usually from the lips, pharynx, gastrointestinal, biliary tract, peritoneum, heart, genitourinary system and organ stimulation, or discomfort visual, olfactory, auditory, gustatory, and even painful stimuli can pass the sensory nerve conduction as a vomiting impulse beyond vomiting threshold boundaries of the central, in addition, sometimes mental factors, increased intracranial pressure and other stimuli can also cause vomiting, emetics directly affect the vomiting center, abnormal metabolites in the body, such as diabetic ketoacidemia, liver disease, uremia, etc. it can stimulate vomiting center or ctz and cause vomiting. the vomiting reaction consists of abdominal muscles, diaphragm and intercostal muscle contraction, abdominal pressure rise, breath holding, palpitations, sweating, upper small intestine and gastric peristalsis, lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and increased salivary secretion. the nausea is often before vomiting. occurrence, older children may have a premonition and narynx or abdominal discomfort, and some may be controlled by the cortex to some extent. infants and young children often show irritability, make faces, yawn, pale, sweating, drooling and not sucking fist, premature infants, full-term newborns and some small babies often have no signs of vomiting due to immature development of the nervous system. sputum can be ejected from the mouth and mouth, and the swallowing reflex and glottis opening and closing reflexes are not coordinated. the vomit is easily abused. the newborn also has a small gastric capacity and a large amount of fluid, so it is easy to ingest too much. the gastric mucosa is sensitive to temperature, volume, hypoxia and chemical stimulation; often supine; esophagus muscle layer elastic fiber development is poor; lower esophageal sphincter development is less mature, his angle is more blunt, etc., the gastric contents are easily reversed from the esophagus when the stomach is reversed. (b) pathophysiology due to the complex and diverse causes of vomiting, vomiting and duration of vomiting, varying degrees and ages, so the impact on the body is very different, the light has no effect, only a temporary discomfort, long-term chronic vomiting can cause digestive esophagitis, hypovolemia, hypokalemia, low sodium, alkalosis and other metabolic disorders, further anemia, malnutrition, stagnant growth and development, can cause water and electrolyte balance disorder, shock or aspiration, suffocation, induced heart rhythm or even death, due to surgical reasons can also lead to digestive tract perforation, diffuse peritonitis, shock, sepsis and other serious consequences, those with motor nerve dysfunction are also prone to vomiting mistakes suck, need to be more vigilant.","['resident doctor', 'acute abdomen', 'lean stool', 'appetite loss', 'abdominal tension', 'abdominal pain', 'toxin', 'burning heart', 'constipation', 'intestinal paralysis' , 'belch']",['aspiration pneumonia'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
pediatric acute cholecystitis,"acute cholecystitis is rare in children, occasionally with cholelithiasis (children are more rare).the onset is often more rapid, more than 1 day after the onset of the disease, with abdominal pain, high fever warfare as the main symptoms, occasional jaundice, upper abdominal pain is persistent or intermittent dull pain, pain or severe cramps, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, high fever can cause convulsions, or mental disorders, paralysis, coma and other symptoms, jaundice is lighter, time is short.","general acute cholecystitis can be self-healing by non-surgical treatment, but with peritonitis, it must be actively prepared for surgery, and 3 cases died in 66 cases. the age is 2 months and 2 cases within 1 year. all were associated with advanced children with biliary peritonitis. prevention: 1. pay attention to diet, food should be light, eat less greasy and fried, grilled food. 2. keep the stool clear, liver and gallbladder dampness, when the stool is secret, the symptoms are aggravated, it is very important to keep the stool clear. 3. to change the sedentary lifestyle, move more and exercise more. 4. to support, long-term family is not jealous, people with a bad mood can cause or aggravate the disease, to be broad-minded and comfortable.","this plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute cholecystitis. often caused by stones, parasites, congenital stenosis and obstruction and congenital common bile duct malformation. due to obstruction of the cystic duct, a large amount of cholestasis is deposited in the gallbladder, and part of the water is absorbed by the wall of the capsule, causing the bile to concentrate and the concentration of bile salts to increase, stimulating the gallbladder mucosa and causing chemical inflammation of the gallbladder. more than 90% of patients with acute cholecystitis are caused by obstruction of the cystic duct or gallbladder emptying. gallbladder stones or bile deposits in the neck of the gallbladder are an important cause of obstruction. therefore, acute cholecystitis has calculus and non-calculus. points. in children, calculus cholecystitis is rare, and there has been a clear upward trend in recent years. the cause of acalculous cholecystitis is unclear and may be due to a variety of factors. if the cystic duct is too long and distorted, but the cystic duct lumen is blocked by aphids, mucus, gallbladder pedicled polyps, or gallbladder emptying disorder caused by dysfunction of the biliary system, causing bile accumulation in the cystic duct or obstruction. in rural areas of china, biliary ascariasis and biliary infections are one of the important causes of disease. bacterial invasion is another important cause of acute cholecystitis. the main routes of bacterial invasion are: 1 from the duodenum through the common bile duct invasion, the most common aphid drilling into the bile duct, carrying bacteria into the 2; portal vein blood into the liver and gallbladder, more common in critically ill intestinal flora shift 3; lymphatic vessels into the liver and gallbladder; 4 arterial blood into the gallbladder artery to the gallbladder, rare. choles deposition is good for bacterial growth. the pathogenic bacteria are mainly intestinal-derived bacteria, such as escherichia coli, proteus, bacteroides, etc., mostly mixed infections. acute cholecystitis may be associated with acute pancreatitis, which may be caused by abnormal pancreaticobiliary confluence leading to pancreatic enzyme reflux, which is caused by gallbladder bile activation and damage to the gallbladder mucosa. in addition, acalculous cholecystitis can occur on the basis of severe trauma, burns, major surgery, and long-term fasting and application of cholestasis such as tpn. most of these cases have gallbladder formation during the onset of gallbladder. . it has been reported that thick bile and bile can stimulate the secretion of prostaglandins i2 and e2 from the gallbladder epithelium, which in turn mediates the inflammatory response. immune-suppressed children can develop opportunistic microbial infections leading to acute cholecystitis, such as cytomegalovirus or cryptosporidium infection of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).","['coma', 'blunt pain', 'abdominal tension', 'abdominal pain', 'convulsions', 'acute illness', 'disgusting', 'consciousness', 'peritonitis']",['peritonitis'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
small intestine,"when there is an abnormal passage between the intestines and other hollow organs or between the body surface, it is intestinal fistula, and the small intestine occurs in the small intestine. the small intestine fistula can be divided into duodenal fistula according to which part of the small intestine is located. , jejunum and ileum.when the intestinal fistula is connected with other hollow organs such as the biliary tract, urinary tract, genital tract or other intestines, it is called internal hemorrhoid; on the contrary, if it is connected with the body surface, the external hemorrhoids, the duodenum and the ligament below the ligament are 100cm. the intestinal fistula is high in the sputum, and the ileum in the distal segment is low in the sputum.according to the amount of small intestinal sputum discharge, it can be divided into high flow enthalpy and low flow enthalpy.","most of the small intestine fistula occurs in abdominal surgery. the main reason is the organic environment, nutritional status and immune function. in addition to the urgent need for emergency surgery, adequate preoperative preparation should be done for elective surgery to correct water and electrolyte disorders and improve nutrition. controlling infections will effectively reduce the incidence of intestinal cramps. for a wide range of abdominal adhesion surgery, the operation should be patient and meticulous, reduce the damage of the intestinal wall, the rupture of the small muscle layer of the small area should be repaired, the damage range is large and the affected intestinal segment is not long, and the adhesion of the intestinal segment can be considered. surgical indications for inflammatory bowel obstruction should be strictly controlled. anastomotic rupture is one of the main causes of intestinal fistula formation. there are many reasons for intestinal fistula caused by rupture of anastomotic stoma. anastomosis technique is the key. suture overdensity leads to local tissue ischemia and poor healing. suture can cause anastomosis. leakage, effective postoperative gastrointestinal decompression is an effective measure to prevent anastomotic leakage. control of intra-abdominal infection is an essential factor to ensure good healing of the anastomosis. the necessary abdominal drainage is also important.","there are many reasons for small bowel fistula, which can be roughly divided into surgery, injury, disease and congenital, etc. most of them are caused by surgery. (1) surgery-induced surgery is the most common cause of small intestine fistula. xiju medical college reported that 95.1% of the small intestinal fistulas treated between 1957 and 1983 occurred after surgery. roback et al reported 55 cases of high intestinal small intestines. for example, crohn's disease complicated with intestinal aid occurs after surgery, and the causes of intestinal fistula after surgery are various. (1) gastrointestinal anastomotic leakage: it is a common cause of intestinal fistula. many anastomotic leakage are due to operational technical disadvantages. for example, the diameter of the gastrointestinal tract at both ends of the anastomosis is too much, and the anastomosis is not uniform enough. there is a large pore in one place; the anastomosis is too dense or too sparse; the blood supply to the anastomosis is insufficient or the tension is too high; the intestinal wall of the anastomosis is edema, scar or cancer infiltration, and the distal intestine of the anastomosis after surgery obstruction or poor proximal gastrointestinal tract decompression is also the cause of anastomotic leakage. (2) duodenal fistula: due to only partial peritoneal covering, the duodenum is prone to sputum after anastomosis or suture. the sputum occurs at the stump closure or the incision of the intestine wall can be divided into ends.fistula and lateral iliac crest, in which the loss of intestinal fluid is more serious with lateral sputum, and the prognosis is worse. the end sputum occurs after gastrectomy, or because of scar tissue at the stump, or due to insufficient blood supply, or improper suture operation. such as excessive varus, excessive tension, etc., a large part of the lateral paralysis is formed after the duodenal oddi's sphincter incision, or due to omission during the incision suture to produce duodenal posterior wall leakage, or leakage due to excessive tension of the transverse wall after longitudinal sulcus of the duodenum; may also occur in the duodenum when right kidney resection or right colon surgery. (3) surgical injury: if the abdominal surgery is poorly exposed or extensive intestinal adhesion, or due to insufficient experience of the surgeon, the operation may cause damage to the intestinal wall or its blood supply and cause intestinal fistula, especially in the case of extensive intestinal adhesion surgery. it is most likely to damage the intestinal wall and requires special attention. (4) after the operation, foreign matter such as gauze or drainage tube is left, and the steel wire suture is improperly placed: the gauze left in the abdominal cavity mostly causes intestinal perforation and abdominal abscess, abscess or self-piercing incision, or formation of external hemorrhoids after surgical drainage. improper drainage tube after operation (the tube is too hard, the catheter is pressed against the intestinal wall) can be pressed, and the intestinal wall is worn to form an external hemorrhoid. after the operation, the abdominal wall should be carefully put into the drainage tube to avoid damage, and the abdominal cavity negative pressure suction of the drainage tube may attract the intestinal wall, causing perforation of ischemic necrosis of the intestinal wall, which should be avoided. if it is necessary to continue vacuum suction, double-cannula drainage should be used, and the suture for the reduction of steel wire is best placed. extraperitoneal, otherwise, when the intestine is excessively flattened, the wire is pressed against the intestinal wall and intestinal fistula occurs. (b) traumatic abdomen sharp or blunt trauma may damage the intestine to intestinal fistula, especially the duodenum of the part of the retroperitoneum, due to fixation and vulnerable to crush injury, intestinal perforation generally into the free abdominal cavity, causes diffuse peritonitis; the posterior wall penetrates to form a retroperitoneal abscess, which can later break into the free abdominal cavity. it has been reported that acupuncture treatment causes intestinal spasm, and radiation therapy may also damage the intestinal wall and cause paralysis. (c) the disease caused by small appendicitis acute appendicitis after perforation often form appendix abscess, drainage often form appendix stump sputum, inflammatory bowel disease such as crohn disease, intestinal tuberculosis and intestinal tumors can form intestinal perforation and intestinal fistula inflammatory diseases such as crohn's disease and abdominal abscess can cause internal hemorrhoids between different intestinal segments. another common internal hemorrhoid is gallbladder or internal fistula between the bile duct and the intestine, when the gallbladder occurs due to inflammation and duodenum. after adhesion, stones in the gallbladder can compress the gallbladder adhesion to cause ischemia, after necrosis become internal hemorrhoids (cabular duodenal fistula), gallbladder fistula can also pass into the stomach or colon, duodenal bulb ulcer can also be combined with gallbladder or bile duct duodenal fistula, acute necrotizing pancreatitis with an abscess can also break into the intestine and form intestinal fistula. (d) congenital anomalies of the yolk canal can cause congenital umbilical hernia. the pathophysiology caused by small intestinal fistula may vary depending on the level of the sputum. generally speaking, the physiological disturbance of the high intestinal fistula is lower than that of the sputum, and the following pathophysiological changes are generally observed. (1) dehydration and electrolytes, acid-salt balance disorder the daily gastrointestinal secretions of adults are estimated to be 7000-10,000 ml, most of which are re-absorbed in the proximal ileum and colon, so the upper part of the duodenum and jejunum the high intestinal small intestines lose more intestinal fluid per day, which can be as high as 7000ml. therefore, if it is not timely replenished, it can quickly cause dehydration, low blood volume, peripheral circulatory failure, and shock. in the same amount of water loss in the same fashion, there is electrolyte loss, depending on the location of the sputum. if the main loss of gastric juice, the loss of electrolyte is mainly h+ and cl. for example, the loss of intestinal fluid is mainly na+, k+ and hco3. can lose 2F40g of nacl every day. with the loss of electrolyte, it will affect the balance of acid and strontium. a large amount of sputum loss of intestinal fluid often causes metabolic acidosis. if it loses acidic gastric juice, it can produce low-potassium sputum poisoning. the loss of water and electrolytes in the lower intestinal tract is less, such as the distal ileum, the daily fluid loss is only about 200ml, which rarely causes serious physiological disturbance. the internal hemorrhoid between the high intestine and the colon will short-circuit a long segment of the intestine with important digestive and absorbing functions, which can cause severe diarrhea, which can also cause serious water and electrolyte disorders and nutritional disorders. (2) infection of a small number of small intestines is formed by non-healing of the surgical drainage, such as the duodenal or jejunostomy; other sputum is formed by the gradual penetration of the two hollow organs that have been adhered; these sputum are not accompanied by obvious local or systemic infections during the formation process. however, most of the intestinal fistulas are complicated by the formation or diffuse peritonitis, and abscesses, single or multiple, patients with fever, abdominal pain, bloating, stomach intestinal dysfunction such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea or no defecation, weight loss, symptoms of poisoning, even sepsis, shock, death; can also cause stress ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, toxic hepatitis, ards, renal failure and so on. (3) malnutrition with the loss of intestinal fluid, there is still a large loss of digestive enzymes and proteins, and the function of digestion and absorption is impaired, resulting in a negative nitrogen balance, vitamin deficiency, rapid weight loss, anemia, hypoproteinemia, and even evil. liquid quality and death. (4) skin erosion around the mouth of the mouth due to long-term erosion of the digestive juice, the skin around the mouth is prone to erosion. the patient complains of severe pain. especially the high intestinal juice is rich in digestive enzymes, which is more likely to cause skin damage. granulation tissue can also be eroded by the erosion of digestive juice. (2) pathogenesis 1. pathophysiology local damage and systemic influence after intestinal fistula are affected by many factors, the most important factors are the position of the sputum, the size of the flow and the patency of the drainage, after the occurrence of small intestinal fistula the following series of pathophysiological changes can occur in the body. (1) body fluid, electrolyte disorder and acid-base imbalance: the daily gastrointestinal secretion of adults is 7000 ~ 8000ml, most of which are reabsorbed in the ileum and proximal colon, so the upper part of the duodenum and jejunum is small intestine the amount of intestinal fluid lost per day can be as high as several thousand milliliters. therefore, if the patient fails to get timely and appropriate supplements, obvious dehydration and acid-base imbalance can occur soon, and severe circulation can lead to peripheral circulation and renal failure. hypovolemic shock, or even death. in the same fashion, the loss of electrolytes, the loss of electrolytes, depending on the location of the phlegm, such as the main loss of gastric juice, the electrolyte loss is mainly h+ and cl-, such as loss of intestinal fluid, na+, k+ and hco3- for many, with the loss of electrolyte will inevitably affect the acid-base balance, the loss of a large amount of alkaline intestinal fluid will cause metabolic acidosis, such as the main loss of acidic gastric juice will produce hypokale alkalosis. in the low intestinal sputum, the electrolyte loses less. for example, the distal ileal sputum loses about 200ml per day, which rarely causes serious physiological disturbances. therefore, it has little effect on the whole body, and it can maintain balance after proper supplementation. the internal hemorrhoid between the high intestine and the colon causes a long segment of the intestine with important digestive and absorbing functions to produce severe diarrhea and water, electrolyte imbalance and nutritional disorders. (2) infection: after the occurrence of intestinal fistula, the intestinal contents flow into the abdominal cavity, often causing acute diffuse peritonitis. if not drained in time, it can cause toxic shock, even in a short period of time, such as the lower position of the sputum, the mouthwash small, low flow, can lead to localized peritonitis, and then develop into abdominal abscess, the formation of extraintestinal fistula after perforation of the abscess, such as drainage is not timely or not smooth, infection can continue to increase, develop into sepsis, may also be associated with aggressive ulcer bleeding, impaired liver function, ards and multiple organ failure, peritonitis and abdominal abscess are the most important pathological lesions in the early stage of intestinal fistula. early detection and timely and effective drainage are extremely important and can interrupt their development for further treatment. provide favorable conditions. (3) malnutrition: due to the loss of a large amount of digestive enzymes in the sputum, not only the intestinal digestion and absorption function is seriously impaired, but also a large amount of protein is lost, and patients with intestinal fistula often cannot eat, thus inevitably causing significant negative nitrogen. balance, different degrees of malnutrition, rapid decline in body weight, anemia, hypoproteinemia, organ atrophy, not only poor wound healing, but also serious infection due to low immune function, excessive consumption eventually leads to cachexia and death, this kind of death the change in the lower position of the small intestine is prominent. (4) skin erosion around the mouth: it is digested and corroded by enzymes in the digestive juice. the skin around the mouth often has flushing and varying degrees of erosion. the range is gradually enlarged, it is difficult to control and treat, and the pain is severe and unbearable. eczema and dermatitis may occur in the skin around the mouth, or soft tissue infections such as bloating and cellulitis may occur. (5) pathological changes of intestinal fistula: the development of intestinal fistula and its final outcome are always closely related to the pathological condition of the intestine and adjacent tissues in the area where the intestinal fistula is located. in the early stage, the intestinal tube near the intestinal fistula has edema and inflammation. and often accompanied by the corresponding dysmotility, resulting in the retention of intestinal contents and increased intestinal pressure, so that the mouth continues to increase, the sputum also increased, after other treatments such as drainage and anti-infection, the intestinal wall and surrounding the inflammation and edema of the tissue gradually subsided, the patency of the intestinal tract was restored, the mouthwash was also reduced, the outflow began to decrease, the adhesion around the intestinal fistula, the granulation tissue proliferated to form a tubular tendon, and finally the fistula was filled with granulation tissue and formed a fibrous scar. healing, this is the process in which the small intestine sputum grows from small to large, and then properly healed and then healed from large to small. some of the sputum can not be healed naturally, and further surgery is needed. in order to facilitate clinical treatment, the whole pathological process can be divided into three stages according to the systemic and local pathological changes of intestinal fistula: thefirst stage: from the occurrence of intestinal fistula the condition is stable, usually 2 to 3 weeks. the main contradiction in this stage is peritonitis, abdominal abscess and water caused by the loss of a large amount of intestinal fluid, electrolyte imbalance. in the treatment, we should take active and effective measures against the above contradictions, and strive to strive for make the condition stable soon. the second stage: peritonitis has been controlled, the abscess has been drained, the loss of intestinal fluid begins to decrease, and the condition is relatively stable. as the disease period prolongs, the nutritional problem will turn into a major contradiction. it should reduce the loss of intestinal fluid, supplement nutrition, and promote the reduction of intestinal fistula and wound healing are important. if this stage is prolonged, other complications can still occur, and even the patient will die and die. the third stage: the whole body condition turns from stable to better, the body weight begins to increase, and the part of the mouth gradually shrinks with the proliferation of granulation tissue and the formation of scars. most of the tubular tendons can be closed by themselves, and the tubular sputum and lip sputum which cannot be closed by themselves it also has the conditions for surgical repair, and can be surgically selected after necessary preparation. 2. the classification of intestinal fistula can be carried out from different angles. the commonly used classification methods are as follows: (1) according to the cause classification: it can be divided into three types: injury, inflammation and tumor. (2) according to the classification of anatomical parts: according to the original part of the sputum, such as duodenal fistula, jejunum fistula, ileum fistula and colon fistula, etc., some people put the duodenum and duodenal suspensory ligament below 100cm range the intestinal fistula is called high intestinal fistula, and the distal ileal fistula is called low intestinal fistula. this classification mainly focuses on the nature and extent of water and electrolyte imbalance that may be caused, which is convenient for guiding clinical treatment. (3) according to the classification of intestinal fistula and skin: it can be divided into indirect (also known as complexity) and direct (also known as simple), usually indirect intestine in the initial stage of sputum, the contents of the intestine gather in somewhere in the abdominal cavity and indirectly drained to the abdomen. this intestinal fistula is the most harmful to the patient. (4) according to the shape classification of sputum: it can be divided into lip sputum and tubular sputum. the former refers to the part of the intestine mucosa eversion and the skin is more like a lip, which is named after the sputum, but the latter is not self-healing. this classification has certain guiding significance for treatment. (5) according to the intestinal fistula occurring in the side of the intestine or the end of the classification: can be divided into lateral and terminal sputum, the lateral sputum lost intestinal fluid is more serious, the prognosis is also poor. (6) according to the outflow volume of the mouthwash within 24 hours on an empty stomach: it can be divided into two types: high flow rate and low flow rate. generally, it is called high-flow intestinal fistula which discharges more than 1000 ml of intestinal fluid through the fistula within 24 hours. (7) according to the number of sputum classification: can be divided into single and multiple, these classifications are proposed from a certain side, the purpose is to make an estimate of all aspects of sputum, in order to guide clinical treatment, therefore, after the occurrence of intestinal fistula, after a period of emergency treatment, it is necessary to make qualitative, localized and quantitative diagnosis of the intestinal fistula that has occurred as much as possible, and to synthesize the above various classifications and make a comprehensive comprehensive judgment in order to better arrange treatment plan.","['abdominal tenderness', 'abdominal discomfort', 'lean stool',  'septicemia', 'abdominal pain', 'thinness', 'disgusting', 'abdominal infection', 'peritonitis']",['digestive tract bleeding'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
bacterial liver abscess,bacterial liver abscess refers to the intrahepatic purulent infection caused by the invasion of suppurative bacteria into the liver. the disease can be caused by biliary diseases (16% to 40%) and portal vein infection (8% to 24%).,"the prevention of bacterial liver abscess includes two aspects: 1. improve the health of the body, enhance the body's ability to prevent disease and disease, and at the same time avoid factors that may induce the body's resistance to reduce, such as high-dose chemotherapy, radiotherapy and long-term use an immunosuppressant. 2. for diseases that are prone to induce bacterial liver abscess, we should pay close attention to treatment, such as hepatolithiasis, acute suppurative obstructive cholangitis, abdominal infection, intestinal infection, etc., after controlling these causes, it can prevent bacterial liver abscess. the occurrence, in fact, due to the early use of powerful and effective antibiotics, the incidence of bacterial liver abscess has been greatly reduced.","(a) the cause of the disease bacterial liver abscess is a suppurative infection caused by purulent bacteria, also known as suppurative liver abscess, the liver due to the dual blood supply of the hepatic artery and portal vein, and through the biliary rich blood supply and single the powerful phagocytosis of the nuclear-macrophage system can kill invading bacteria and prevent their growth. therefore, bacterial liver abscess does not occur often. when the body's resistance is weak, the invading purulent bacteria can cause liver infection. abscess, the most common pathogen causing bacterial liver abscess in adults is escherichia coli, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus in children, followed by friedlnder klebsiella, the pathogen enters the liver through the following pathways: 1. biliary system this is the most important infection route in our country. in cases with biliary obstruction and secondary infection, such as common bile duct stones, biliary tract worm or clonorchiasis, etc. in patients with acute suppurative choledochitis, bacteria can go up the biliary tract and infect the liver to form a liver abscess. 2. intra- abdominal infection of theportal system(such as gangrenous appendicitis, suppurative pelvic inflammatory disease, etc.), intestinal infection (such as ulcerative enteritis, bacillary dysentery, etc.), sputum nucleus infection, etc. can cause thrombophlebitis of the portal vein branch, its septic the emboli can fall into the liver along the portal system, causing liver abscess. due to the widespread use of antibiotics, infection in this pathway is rare. 3. lymphatic system the adjacent parts of the liver such as purulent lesions such as cholecystitis, underarm abscess and stomach, duodenal perforation, etc., bacteria can invade the liver through the lymphatic system. 4. blood infection of any part of the body of purulent infection, such as respiratory infection, acute osteomyelitis, subacute endocarditis, sputum and sputum and other bacteremia, pathogens can be inserted into the liver by the hepatic artery. 5. direct invasion when the liver has an open injury, the bacteria can directly invade through the wound. sometimes, the closed injury of the liver forms a subcapsular hematoma of the liver, and the original bacteria in the liver can transform the hematoma into an abscess. 6. other ways of unknown reasons there are no obvious causes of liver abscess, such as occult liver abscess, there may be some infectious lesions in the body. when the body's resistance is weakened, accidental bacteremia causes liver inflammation and abscess. it is reported that occultity 25% of liver abscesses are associated with diabetes. due to the extensive and effective application of antibiotics and the advancement of surgical treatment in recent years, cases of bacterial liver abscess caused by other abdominal infections have been rare. peking union medical college hospital has earlier and nearly 10 years of bacterial liver abscess cases, biliary system. stones and tumors are the main cause of the disease. diabetic patients are more likely to have this disease (8.3%), and cases with negative bacterial culture have increased (52.1%). currently, biliary liver abscess accounts for about half or more, combined with stones. or cancerous biliary obstruction is more likely to occur, and biliary aphids are still reported in some grassroots units. as for the so-called unexplained liver abscess, it is speculated that it is most likely caused by bacteremia that is not obvious in the primary lesion; mild liver injury or ischemia may also be its direct cause, and diabetes is also a bacterial liver abscess. the cause of the disease, sometimes the bacterial culture of the liver abscess is negative, and it is not excluded due to the inappropriate culture technique for anaerobic bacteria. (b) the pathogenesis of bacterial liver abscess is mostly mixed infection, often detected a variety of bacteria, mainly endogenous bacteria, more than 60% of the intestinal gram-negative bacilli, the most common in the past is escherichia coli klebsiella has been raised to the first place. the most common positive cocci are staphylococcus aureus. klebsiella, proteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa are important pathogens for patients with long-term hospitalization and antibiotic treatment. anaesthetic anaerobic bacteria can be detected in the pus of about half of patients with liver abscess. the most commonly isolated anaerobic bacteria are bacteroides fragilis, clostridium megai, etc., biliary liver abscess and portal vein infected liver abscess. the pathogen is mainly escherichia coli, and the pathogen of hepatic artery blood-staining liver abscess is staphylococcus aureus. after the bacteria invade the liver, it causes an inflammatory reaction of the liver. when the body has strong resistance or after a certain treatment, the inflammation can be absorbed by itself, and even some small abscesses that have formed can be absorbed after being effectively treated. healing, on the other hand, when the body's resistance is low and the treatment is not timely, the inflammation will spread and spread further, especially in the concentrated part of the lesion. due to the destruction of the liver tissue, multiple small abscesses can be gradually expanded and merged into one or several a large abscess, so liver abscess is mostly single, but it can also be multiple, in general, blood-borne infections are often multiple, the lesion is mainly right liver or involving the whole liver, the origin of biliary-derived liver abscess in multiple small abscesses, its distribution is consistent with the distribution of intrahepatic bile duct lesions, located on one side of the liver, one leaf or one segment, the abscess often communicates with the bile duct, and the bile duct is also filled with pus. some people think that acute obstructive suppuration the late stage of cholangitis is essentially a manifestation of acute liver abscess. abscess and cryptogenic abscess caused by hematoma infection after liver trauma are mostly single, due todirty blood circulation is abundant. once an abscess is formed, a large amount of toxin is absorbed into the blood, and severe sepsis appears in the clinic. when the abscess turns chronic, granulation tissue growth and fibrosis appear on the wall of the abscess. it gradually reduces or disappears. if the liver abscess is not properly controlled, it can be worn to the underarm, abdominal cavity, and thoracic cavity. liver abscess caused by biliary infection may also be associated with biliary bleeding.","['pulse rate increase', 'lung infection', 'liver function impaired', 'ascites', 'abdominal tension', 'abdominal pain', 'night sweat', 'hepatomegaly', 'liver enlargement' , 'peritonitis']",['biliary bleeding'],['hepatopathy'],"['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
lower gastrointestinal bleeding,"lower gastrointestinal bleeding refers to the intestines less than 50cm from the duodenal suspensory ligament, including jejunum, ileum, colon and rectal lesions. it is customary not to include hemorrhage caused by sputum and anal fissure. blood is the main type, and the light is only fecal occult blood or black feces. when the amount of bleeding is large, blood is discharged, and in severe cases, shock occurs. when inflammation or ulceration occurs in the mucosa of the digestive tract, mucosal congestion, edema, and ulceration may occur. when inflammation or ulceration erodes blood vessels or blood vessels increases, small blood vessels may rupture.treatment plans should be developed for different causes. when the cause of bleeding is not clear, supportive therapy such as anti-shock should be given first.absolutely rest in bed, closely observe blood pressure, pulse, respiratory and peripheral circulation perfusion, accurately record the number and number of black feces or blood in the stool, regular review of hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes and liver function.the whole blood is supplemented so that the hemoglobin is not less than 10 g/dl and the pulse is less than 100 times per minute.","1, should actively treat the primary disease under the guidance of a doctor, such as peptic ulcer and cirrhosis. 2, life should be regular, diet should be regular, avoid overeating, avoid alcohol, avoid smoking, do not drink strong tea and coffee. 3, pay attention to the use of drugs, should be used with little or no irritating drugs, if necessary, should be used to maintain gastric mucosal drugs. 4, regular physical examination, in order to find early lesions, timely treatment, in the presence of symptoms such as dizziness, should be checked in the morning.","hemorrhoids, anal fissure, anal fistula.rectal disease rectal injury, non-specific proctitis, tuberculous proctitis, rectal tumors, rectal carcinoids, adjacent malignant tumors or abscesses invade the rectum. bacterial dysentery, amoebic dysentery, chronic non-specific ulcerative colitis, diverticulum, polyps, cancer and vascular malformations.small intestinal disease acute hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis, intestinal tuberculosis, crohn's disease, jejunal diverticulitis or ulcer, intussusception, small intestine tumor, gastrointestinal polyposis, small intestinal hemangioma and vascular malformation.","['repeated bleeding', 'diverticulum hemorrhage', 'diarrhea', 'intestinal vascular malformation', 'stool blood', 'gastrointestinal bleeding', 'abdominal pain', 'low fever', 'blood hypoxia', 'intestine stack ']",['anemia'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'interventional therapy']"
pediatric peptic ulcer,"pepticulcer is not common in early childhood, and there are many cases in adolescents. in recent years, due to the wide application of endoscopes in the clinic, the incidence rate has increased. children of all ages can develop morbidity to newborns and the elderly. more common.gastric ulcers often occur in small infants, mostly stress ulcers, and duodenal ulcers occur mostly in older children.the average incidence of duodenal ulcer in children is about 3 to 5 times higher than that of gastric ulcer.there are more boys than girls, and the general statistics are about 2:1.it is reported that 21% to 50% of adult cases begin in childhood.1.6% started before the age of 4. acute peptic ulcer in children is more than chronic ulcer, secondary to more than primary.often secondary to severe hypoxia or severe infections (sepsis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, meningitis), severe malnutrition, large amounts of long-term use of corticosteroids, extensive burns (curlign's ulcer), neurological damage (cranial when damage, encephalitis, brain tumors and the like are involved in the thalamus, especially in the late stage of the disease, rokitansky-cushing's ulcer may be complicated.","1. pay attention to the combination of work and rest, reasonably arrange the children's study and life, and don't let the children get too tired and nervous. 2, to prevent

low-fat and digestible foods.at the same time correct the eclipse habits of children. 4, do not eat irritating food for a long time, but eat cold drinks, such as ice cream. 5, eat slowly, do not let the children eat while eating, or eat while reading books and television.","the causes of peptic ulcer are numerous, including genetics, spirit, environment, diet, smoking, endocrine and other factors. so far, there is no conclusion. the pathogenesis tends to be attack factor-defense factor imbalance theory. under normal circumstances, gastric mucosa secretes mucus. defensive factors such as good blood transport, vigorous cell renewal ability and regulation mechanism of gastric juice secretion are superior, or balanced with attack factors such as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, hp, etc., and can be formed once the attack factor is enhanced and/or the defense factor is weakened. ulcers, it is currently believed that among the above factors, two major environmental factors are important for the onset of most ulcer patients, namely the use of helicobacter pylori infection and aspirin (asa) or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), it can be said that the cause of familial ulcer disease is related to heredity and to cross-infection of helicobacter pylori in family members. harmful factors for peptic ulcer the basic factor for the formation of peptic ulcer is an increase in gastric acid-pepsin secretion. in 1910, schwartz put forward the famous saying ""no acid and no ulcer"", which is still correct. gastric acid is secreted by parietal cells of gastric mucosa. there are three receptors on the parietal cells, namely acetylcholine receptor, gastrin receptor and histamine receptor. these three receptors produce an acid-secreting effect after stimulation with the corresponding substances acetylcholine, gastrin and histamine, and vagal activity is also associated with gastric acid secretion. 1 wall cell acid secretion process can be divided into 3 steps: a. histamine, cholinergic transmitter or gastrin binds to the corresponding receptor on the cell membrane. b. mediated by the second information (amp, ca2), the stimulation signal is transmitted from the intracellular to the apical membrane of the cell. c. under stimulation, transfer h-k-atpase to secretory microtubules, pump h from the cytosol to the gastric cavity to produce gastric acid. in general, histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin promote gastric acid secretion separately. in addition, there is synergy. 2 normal daily average gastric juice secretion of 1000 ~ 1500ml, hydrochloric acid 40mmol / l, duodenal ulcer (du) patients daily gastric secretion of 1500 ~ 2000ml, hydrochloric acid 40 ~ 80mmol / l, and gastric ulcer (gaseric ulcer , gu) patients daily gastric secretion and hydrochloric acid in the normal range, gastric acid secretion changes with age, the gastric juice is alkaline when the child is born, 24 to 48h free acid secretion peak, which is considered to be from the mother gastrin there is a direct relationship between the placenta, 2 days later, the mother's gastrin is reduced, the stomach acid is reduced, and it rises after 10 days, and the low level is 1 to 4 years old, and gradually increases after 4 years old, so the newborn can develop acute gastric ulcer after 2 days of birth. gastric perforation, due to increased gastric acid secretion with age, older children with more peptic ulcers than infants. 3 reasons for increased gastric acid: a. the number of parietal cells increased: 1.09G109 for normal males and 0.82G109 for females, and 1.8G109 for du (more than 1 fold), and gu was 0.8G109 (close to normal). b. gastrin: human gastrin g17 (highest gastric antrum) or g34 (highest duodenum), no increase in gastrin in du patients, it is suggested that the increase of gastric acid secretion in du patients may be related to parietal cells gastrin stimulating sensitivity, isenberg and grossman, have injected 8 different doses of gastrin into patients with du and non-ulcer (nud), resulting in a maximum effective gastric acid secretion (mao), a half effective amount of gastrin ndu the mean value was 148.2I30.3, and the du was 60.5I9.6, indicating that the excessive acid secretion of du patients is caused by the sensitivity of parietal cells to gastrin. c. other factors driving the increase of gastric acid secretion: nerve, endocrine, paracrine and other factors can affect the increase of gastric acid secretion, and the tension of the secretion of basic gastric acid secretion in patients with peptic ulcer increases, and the sensitivity also increases. the main cells of the gastric wall secrete pepsinogen, and according to immunochemical typing, they are divided into proproteinase i (pgi) and proproteinase ii (pgii). there are five subtypes of pgi, which are distributed in the main cells of the stomach, and pgii is present in the stomach. gastric sinus, the application of radioimmunoassay can measure the increase of pgi in the blood of 30% to 50% du patients. when it reaches 130米g/l, its risk of du is 3 times higher than that of normal people, and the risk of gu is increased by 3 times when pgii is increased. the digestion of pepsin is closely related to gastric acid. when the ph of gastric acid is 1.8-2.5, the activity of pepsin is optimal. when ph>4, pepsin loses activity and does not digest, so digestion must be sufficient. the acid can make the pepsin be activated when the ph reaches 3 or less. the stomach acid and pepsin act together to produce ulcers, but gastric acid is the main factor. the pepsin content in the gastric juice is very small when the child is born, and then slowly increases until the puberty reaches the adult level. the relationship between bile and gastric ulcer has been reported. when motility disorder occurs in the antrum or duodenum, bile nausea causes gastric mucosal damage, especially bile and pancreatic juice are mixed with each other in the duodenum to form lysolecithin. destruction of the gastric mucosal barrier, so that the hydrogen ions are reversely dispersed to damage the gastric mucosa. it is believed that the damage of bile to the gastric mucosa is mainly caused by bile acid (bile salt), which increases the reverse diffusion of hydrogen ions in the stomach. the effect of reducing the potential difference of mucosa is closely related to the acidic environment and the concentration of bile in the stomach. animal experiments show that the reverse diffusion of hydrogen ions in the high concentration of bile and ph=2, the most significant reaction, low concentration and ph= the reaction was mild under conditions of 8. bile acid stimulates mast cells to release histamine. histamine can dilate the blood vessels of the gastric mucosa and increase the permeability of the capillary wall, leading to mucosal edema, hemorrhage, inflammation and erosion. under such circumstances, the mucosa can easily develop into ulcers. hp is closely related to chronic gastritis. inhibition of hp increases the rate of healing of primary peptic ulcer. the recurrence rate of ulcers after hp elimination is significantly reduced. the elimination of bacteria and the regression of gastroduodenal inflammation are related to the recurrence of ulcers in many studies. according to the literature, more than 90% of patients with gastroduodenal ulcer who have not taken asa and other nsaids have chronic active gastritis caused by hp infection, only about 5% to 10% of patients with duodenal ulcer and 30 % of patients with gastric ulcer have no clear evidence of hp infection, and the 1-year recurrence rate of peptic ulcer after eradication of hp is <10%, and the recurrence rate of hp() after peptic ulcer healing is about 50% in 1 year, 2 years. the recurrence rate is almost 100%, so there is no acid and no ulcer, and there is a tendency to be replaced by ""no hp infection without ulcer"" or both. the alteration of hp infection in gastric mucosa may be related to hp products (cytotoxin, urease) and inflammatory process. hp infection and mucosal inflammation may destroy the integrity of gastric and duodenal mucosal barrier, du does not with hp is rare, but it is unclear why only a small number of patients infected with hp develop peptic ulcer, what is its pathogenesis it is thought that it may be related to the following: 1hp strain: different hp strains have different pathogenicity sexuality, resulting in different clinical outcomes, hp strains with cell vacuolating toxin (caga, vaga) infection, increased the chance of ulcers, it has been found that children with ulcers have a high proportion of infections. 2 the genetic susceptibility of the host: the incidence of du in o-type blood is 30% to 40% higher than that in other blood types, and the possibility of du in blood-type substances is not 40% to 50%. some studies also believe that hp infection and different blood group antigens are two independent factors in the occurrence of du. 3 inflammatory reaction: neutrophils cause oxidation reaction, hp surface protein activates monocytes and macrophages, secretes il-1, tnf, and synthesizes platelet activating factor to produce serious pathological reactions. 4 acid secretion reaction: it has been reported that hp infection, food peptone, etc. can cause the release of gastrin from the gastric antrum g cells, and the bacteria return to normal after elimination. more thought: hp infection leads to inflammation of the antrum, making the antrum gastrin release increases, somatostatin secretion decreases and gastric acid secretion increases. 5 gastric epithelial metaplasia of the duodenum: hp causes duodenal gastric mucosal metaplasia, which reduces the secretion of duodenal bicarbonate and increases gastric acid secretion. others believe that the cellular vacuolating toxin produced by hp is released and activated in gastric juice. through the pylorus to the intestinal tract, the activated vacuolar toxin causes vacuolization of duodenal epithelial cells before being digested by some proteases in the intestine, so duodenal ulcer is caused in the absence of hp in the duodenum. among the drugs that cause peptic ulcer, there are three more important categories: 1 aspirin (asa). 2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such as indomethacin, phenylbutazone. 3 adrenal cortex hormone, asa and most other nsaids and peptic ulcer interactions in several aspects: small doses can cause platelet dysfunction, a small dose can cause acute superficial gastric mucosal erosion caused by bleeding, about 2 /3 patients with long-term use of nsaids have gastroduodenal mucosal lesions, most of which are superficial lesions. about 1/4 of patients with long-term use of drugs have ulcer disease, but the mechanism of gastric ulcer caused by asa/nsaids is still unclear. it is believed that these drugs directly damage the gastric mucosa, in addition to increasing the reverse diffusion of hydrogen ions, it can also inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, increase the secretion of gastric acid, pepsin, blood supply to the gastric mucosa, and decrease the barrier function of the gastric mucosa. the 1gu and du siblings were 1.8 times and 2.6 times higher than the general population. gu was susceptible to gu and du was susceptible to du. the family history of children with du was obvious in children. the pud of o-type blood was higher than other blood types by about 35%, mainly du, and ulcer with bleeding, perforation, comorbidity with o-type more common, the investigation found that du children more than men, 48.08% are du family history, family incidence rate 1 family> 2 family members> 3 family members the incidence of grade 1 family members is 11 times higher than that of the general population. o-type blood is more common, accounting for 44.23% of children, and the symptoms are severe. 2hla is a complex genetic polymorphism system. the gene locus is on the short arm of chromosome 6 and many diseases have been found to be associated with certain hla antigens. hla-b5, hla- is found in hla serotyping. b12, hla-bw35 has a correlation with du, hla-dqal*03 gene is associated with du. shanghai lujin hospital detected hla-dqal gene in children with duodenal ulcer, and the frequency of *03 allele in children with du was obvious. below normal healthy children, the *03 gene has an important resistance to du. 3 pepsinogen (pg) is a precursor of pepsin, secreting pgi, pgii. family survey found that half of serum of patients with du increased pgi content. in high pgi offspring, 50% also showed high pgi, indicating that patients with pgi were single chromosome. dominant inheritance supports the presence of du genetics. mental factors: fifteen years ago, patients with gastrostomy found that human gastric mucosa responded differently with people's emotional changes. when excited, gastric mucosa was congested, gastric juice secretion increased, stomach movement increased, and depression and despair, gastric mucosa pale the stomach movement slows down. modern research has found that when the body is in a state of stress or stress, it can produce a series of physiological, neuroendocrine, neurobiochemical, and gastrointestinal functions, including gastric juice secretion, and gastrointestinal exercise will be in the mood. changes under the influence of hypnosis and biofeedback inhibition. during stress, gastric acid secretion increases, pancreatic secretion decreases, and gastric emptying rate decreases significantly. patients with ulcers are more fearful of stress than healthy people. mark and other analysis found that: ulcer patients are suspicious, stubborn, have a strong sense of dependence, poor ability to handle things, immature, impulsive, easy to feel lonely, poor self-control, easy to be under pressure and anxiety, life events frequent reactions are often made, and the incidence of peptic ulcers in school-age children is increased, which is related to the excessive burden of learning, and the increasing complexity of mental stress and psychological factors. food factors: in the rice-rice area of southern china, the incidence of peptic ulcer is higher than that of the northern region where the noodle food is dominant. eating cold drinks, eating spicy food or overeating, not eating breakfast, eating at night, eating fried food bad habits such as sparkling drinks cause direct damage to the gastric mucosa. defensive factors of peptic ulcer 1. gastric mucosal barrier: the gastric mucosal barrier is composed of the tight junction of the cell membrane and intercellular space of the epithelial cells of the mucosa. the process of mucosal resistance to hydrogen ion reverse osmosis has three parts: 1 maintenance of gastric juice the difference between the concentration of hydrogen ions in the medium and the concentration of hydrogen ions in the tissue fluid of the stomach wall. 2 resist the reverse diffusion of hydrogen ions and other harmful substances such as bile, drugs, pepsin damage to the mucosa. 3 epithelial and mucosal / submucosal blood circulation of nutrient mucosa and promote healing. 2, mucosal barrier function: the surface of the gastric mucosa is covered with a layer of mucus, secreted by mucosal epithelial cells and cervical mucosal cells at the gastric crypt, containing macromolecular substances such as glycoprotein, mucopolysaccharide, protein, phospholipid, etc. it is 10 to 20 times that of epithelial cells, so that the mucous membrane below it is isolated from the contents of the stomach cavity, blocking the damage of hydrogen ions and pepsin. 3. bicarbonate secretion: the proximal end of the stomach and duodenal mucosa can also secrete a small amount of bicarbonate into the mucosal layer, neutralizing the acid on the surface of the mucosal layer, so that the surface of the epithelial cells can maintain a ph range of 6-8. resist the reverse dispersion of hydrogen ions. 4, gastric mucosal blood supply and epithelial cell regeneration ability: stomach, duodenal mucosa is rich in blood supply, transporting sufficient nutrients to mucosal cells and continuously removing metabolites, so that epithelial cells are updated in time, animal experiments confirmed mucosa after the injury, it can be repaired quickly within 30 minutes, so the balance between shedding and renewal is maintained, thus maintaining the integrity of the mucosa. when the gastric mucosa is insufficiently supplied, the mucosa is ischemic necrosis, and the cell regeneration is delayed, it may form. ulcer. 5, prostaglandin effect: gastric mucosal epithelial cells have a continuous synthesis and release of endogenous prostaglandins (pg), mainly pge2, the latter has the effect of preventing various harmful substances on the digestive tract epithelial cell damage and acid necrosis, this effect is called cytoprotection and is embodied as follows: 1 protect the gastric mucosa from toxic substances. 2 reduce the gastrointestinal bleeding caused by nsaids, any substance that does not dissociate and dissolve in fat at acidic ph, it is easy to enter the mucosal cells in the stomach, once it enters the cell, it will dissociate due to the change of ph, and it is transparent. reduced sex, retention in mucosal cells to play a toxic role, such as nsaids, pg cell protection mechanism: a. promote gastric mucosal epithelial cells secrete mucus and hco3-. b. inhibition of basic gastric acid and gastric acid secretion after meals. c. strengthen the blood circulation and protein synthesis of the mucosa. d. promote the release of surface active phospholipids, thereby enhancing the water flow on the surface of the gastric mucosa. e. scavenging oxygen free radicals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, so it can induce ulcers. in addition to prostaglandins, some brain gut peptides such as somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, enkephalin, etc. also have cytoprotective effects. (6) epidermal growth factor: epidermal growth factor (egf) is a polypeptide secreted from the salivary gland, duodenal mucus in the brunner gland, pancreas and other tissues. it has been reported that egf is specific to the gastric mucosa in the gastrointestinal tract. receptor binding plays a cytoprotective role. for example, after exogenous egf, it can significantly reduce the damage of gastric mucosa caused by harmful substances such as ethanol and aspirin. preliminary clinical observation can promote ulcer healing after oral administration of egf in patients with peptic ulcer. . egf protects gastric mucosa and promotes ulcer healing. it may be involved in the regulation of egf involved in gastric mucosal epithelial cell regeneration, stimulates digestive tract mucosal dna synthesis, promotes epithelial regeneration and recovery, and has also reported that egf can increase gastric mucosal blood flow. pathogenesis duodenal ulcer is mostly located in the ball, which is more common in large curved and anterior wall. the surface of the ulcer is generally less than 1cm. the gastric ulcer can be seen in the antrum, body and bottom. it is more common in angular sinus and antrum. the depth can reach the mucosal muscle layer, and the erosion is limited to the mucosal surface. the ulcer base can be divided into 4 layers, the surface is covered with a membrane formed by white blood cells, red blood cells and cellulose exudates, and the second layer is cellulose-like necrotic tissue. the third layer is the inflammatory granulation tissue of the blood vessel, and the fourth layer is the fibrous tissue. the ulcer healing process is to first generate granulation tissue from the base, and then the epithelial tissue surrounding the ulcer grows into and differentiates into the surface of the newly grown granulation tissue, and finally covers. ulcer surface, basal granulation tissue hyperplasia, and then the formation of fibrous scar tissue, large or multiple recurrence of ulcers, due to fibrous tissue contraction, can deform the duodenal bulb.","['shock', 'upper gastrointestinal bleeding', 'lanrui', 'black stool', 'blood blood', 'appetite loss', 'abdominal pain', 'irritability', 'disgusting', 'gastrointestinal symptoms' , 'belch']",['pingular obstruction'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
intestinal malabsorption syndrome,"intestinal malabsorption syndrome is a syndrome of small intestine caused by various reasons, such as digestion of the small intestine, so that nutrients can not be absorbed normally, and excreted from the feces, causing nutritional deficiency, also known as digestive malabsorption syndrome.because patients have diarrhea, the stool is thin and large, and contains more oil, also known as steatorrhea.patients may have weight loss, mild tenderness in the abdomen, abnormal sensation in the extremities of the extremities, glossitis or ulceration of the tongue, psoriasis-like coloration, edema, concave nails, muscle tenderness, clubbing (toe) and other signs.","1, it is best to use high calorie, high protein, high vitamin, easy to digest, non-irritating low fat diet. 2, the elderly are well-infected with malabsorption syndrome, mainly related to the degenerative changes of the digestive system in the elderly. after the elderly, the small intestine villi become shorter, the absorption area decreases, and the pancreas gradually shrinks, which can promote or aggravate the absorption of malabsorption. sign. 3, should limit physical labor, should not live in a hot environment.","exogenous evils invade the human body, can invade the spleen and stomach through the meridians, and can also directly commit the coke. the external evils are cold, heat, heat and humidity are common.among them, there are many people who are exposed to moisture.covering the diarrhea, all due to the spleen and stomach, the cause of diarrhea, the most injured in wet evil.wet evil can trap the spleen, causing the spleen to lose health, spleen deficiency can be wet, wet and trapped spleen yang, so the spleen does not transport wet, wet intestines, sputum into diarrhea. if the diet is not knotted or not, it can damage the spleen and stomach, causing the dysfunction of transport, and the water valley stops and stagnate, and the fine emblem is vented.according to modern research, the disease is mainly in the north of china, where the incidence is higher than that of the south.barley, wheat, rye, oatmeal (commonly known as gluten) has a protein soluble in ethanol, which may be the cause of the disease.the main play is caused by toxic chlorotin damage to the small intestine mucosa. congenital genetic defects may be one of the pathogenesis of this disease, which is insufficient endowment and weak body.or due to illness and deficiency, can lead to spleen and stomach transport no power, gas sag, water valley dross mixed.","['stomatitis', 'diarrhea', 'tongue inflammation', 'fat diarrhea', 'night blindness', 'abdominal pain', 'skull finger (toe)', 'living', 'wasting']",['malnutrition'],"['internal medicine', 'digestive internal medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
pediatric acute pancreatitis,"acute pancreatitis in children is relatively rare, and the onset of pancreatic juice spills into the interstitial cells of the pancreas and its surrounding tissues.it is now believed to be associated with viral infections, drugs, pancreatic duct obstruction, and certain systemic diseases or overeating.at least half of the cases are caused by mumps virus or blunt trauma of the upper abdomen, and 30% of cases still have no cause. the relevant data suggest that acute pancreatitis has a pathophysiological process of acute microcirculation.","mainly to actively prevent various causes of the disease. (1) prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases such as biliary tract mites, viral infections, sepsis, and mycoplasmal pneumonia. (2) prevent binge eating and malnutrition, so as to avoid gastrointestinal dysfunction, hinder the normal activity and emptying of the intestinal tract, hinder the normal drainage of bile and pancreatic juice, and cause pancreatitis. (3) avoid or eliminate biliary tract diseases: timely treatment of biliary stones and prevention of intestinal mites. (4) to avoid upper abdominal damage, such as surgery endoscopic retrograde pancreatic ductography. (5) prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders such as hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and the like. (6) others: such as prevention and treatment of alcoholism, trauma, mood and drugs. after 5 to 7 days of non-surgical treatment of acute pancreatitis, the symptoms disappear and gradually heal. hemorrhagic and necrotic pancreatitis are serious and have a long course of disease. they may die due to shock and may form a localized abscess. after the pseudo-pancreatic cyst.","(a) the cause of the disease the commoncause ofacute pancreatitis in children is viral infection, trauma, multi-system disease and congenital malformation of the pancreaticobiliary system, etc., 30% of the cause is unknown. the most important of these is viral infection. 1. infection of various infections such as bacteria or viruses secondary to other parts of the body. (1) viruses: such as acute mumps virus, rubella virus, measles virus, echovirus, coxsackie virus, hepatitis a and hepatitis b virus, cytomegalovirus, and the like. more common is pancreatitis caused by mumps virus. (2) bacterial infection: bacterial infections such as salmonella cause pneumonia, bacillary dysentery, tonsillitis and other diseases, accompanied by acute pancreatitis, mostly caused by bacterial toxins. there are reports of typhoid fever complicated with acute pancreatitis in china. (3) mycoplasma infection: in addition, mycoplasma infection can also cause acute pancreatitis, and pancreatitis can be the first manifestation of mycoplasma infection. (4) parasitic infection: ascending infection and obstruction caused by aphids and liver flukes. more common in asia. 2. gastrointestinal disorders of the digestive tract disease or malformation of the junction of the gallbladder and pancreas, bile reflux into the pancreas, causing pancreatitis. cause: congenital pancreaticobiliary abnormalities cause poor pancreatic juice excretion or biliary ascariasis in the common channel, blocking the discharge of pancreatic juice. the most common obstructive cause in children is. pancreatitis caused by biliary mites. 3. systemic diseases systemic lupus erythematosus, allergic purpura and other systemic diseases, vasculitis involving the blood vessels of the pancreas and other organs, causing inflammation, necrosis, thrombosis of the blood vessel wall and necrotizing pancreatitis. 4. trauma of the abdominal blunt trauma caused the pancreatic duct to be easily injured and broken. pancreatic duct rupture, pancreatic juice spillover, plus blood supply disorders and infections can lead to acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis. 5. drugs and toxins these causes are rare in children. reason: apply a large number of immunosuppressive drugs, adrenal hormones, morphine, etc. 6. endocrine and metabolic diseases these causes are rare in children. (1) malnutrition: low protein diet leads to pancreatic fibrosis, atrophy and stone formation. (2) hypercalcemia: it is caused by activation of trypsin, stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, and formation of pancreatic duct stones. (3) hyperlipidemia: triacylglycerol is acted upon by lipase to release free fatty acids, acting on the endothelium of small blood vessels of the pancreas, causing vascular damage and thrombosis, thereby causing acute pancreatitis. (4) diabetes: in children with type 1 diabetes and ketoacidosis, amylaseemia occurs due to increased salivary amylase. however, acute pancreatitis is rare. (5) metabolic diseases: such as lactateemia, propionic acidemia, glycogen accumulation syndrome type i, homologous cystine urine, and the like. its pathogenesis is unknown. 7. hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder, more common in white races. it is characterized by typical acute pancreatitis in childhood, which is later converted to chronic recurrent episodes, which eventually lead to calcification, diabetes and steatorrhea in the pancreas. (b) pathogenesis the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis is that the zymogen is prematurely activated into active digestive enzymes in the pancreas, and at the same time, the secretion of pancreatic enzyme into the intestinal lumen is blocked. 1. various pancreatic enzymes are activated to cause the secretion of pancreatic acinar cells, the pressure in the pancreatic duct is increased, and the pancreatic duct and pancreatic acinus are ruptured, the pancreatic juice overflows, and it is in contact with pancreatic parenchyma and extra-pancreatic tissue. in the pancreatic juice, trypsinogen is activated in the acinar cells in advance, and the trypsin overflows into the cytoplasm and leaks through the basal membrane to the interstitial tissue, producing autodigestion, causing edema, hemorrhage or necrosis of the pancreatic tissue. at the same time, trypsin activates both the complement and kinin systems. (1) lipase causes peripancreatic fat necrosis, and damaged fat cells can produce harmful factors and more damage to peripheral acinar cells. (2) trypsin: activates various trypsins to make them active. in addition, chymotrypsin can cause tissue edema, hemorrhage and necrosis. (3) phospholipase a: 1 hydrolyzes lecithin in acinar cells to form free fatty acids (ffa) and lysolecithin. the lysolecithin can disintegrate the cell membrane, thereby releasing various digestive enzymes in the cells, causing the pancreas hemorrhagic necrosis and multiple organ damage throughout the body. 2 activation leads to damage of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal enzymes, further causing activation of trypsin and self-digestion. (4) elastic protease: the specific action is mainly to digest the elastic fiber, especially to dissolve the elastic fiber of the blood vessel wall, causing pancreatic blood vessel necrosis and rupture and bleeding. (5) thromboxane a2 (txa2): causes blood supply disorders in pancreatic tissue, destruction of intracellular lysosomal membranes, and increase of intracellular calcium ions. (6) kininase: after activation by kinopeptidase, it is converted to kininase. at the same time, the blood kininogen is decomposed into vasoactive substances, dilate blood vessels and increase capillary permeability, so that the effective circulating blood volume is reduced, resulting in blood pressure drop or shock; kinins are pain-producing substances, which can produce severe visceral pain. at the same time, it causes histamine release and white blood cell agglomeration. (7) pancreatic kallikrein can catalyze the action of kininogen as a bradykinin, which causes vasodilation, increased permeability of the vessel wall, leukocyte exudation and pain. (8) lysosomal enzyme: trypsinogen is activated in acinar cells. this is a key step in the digestion of pancreatic enzymes and hemorrhagic necrosis of pancreatic tissue. in the case of acute pancreatitis, the secretion of antitrypsin is weakened, and the trypsin active complex is aggravated, causing damage to the body. in addition: oxygen free radicals can cause damage to macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and polysaccharides, and increase the permeability of capillary wall in the pancreas. pancreatic edema, hemorrhage, and tissue degeneration and necrosis increase, but do not affect enzyme activation. 2. endotoxemia the incidence is very high. it is caused by lipopolysaccharide in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, which is mainly derived from the intestine, and is the main cause of multiple organ failure and death. its role is: (1) directly destroy the lysosomal membrane in the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, causing cell damage. (2) non-specifically binds to the cell membrane and interferes with the normal function of the cell membrane. (3) damage to the mitochondrial structure, affecting the atpase and oxidative phosphorylation coupling process, causing energy metabolism disorders. (4) causing a series of pathological changes in the body, mainly affecting the vasomotor function, activating vasoactive substances, reducing platelets and leukocytes, lowering blood pressure, developing dic and causing multiple organ failure. (5) change the immune function of the body. 3. enzymatic toxic substances aresubstancesproduced and secreted by the pancreas at the time of onset. role: 1 caused by tissue edema, hemorrhage and necrosis in the pancreas and pancreas. 2 and the toxins produced by necrotic tissue can be transported to the whole body via the lymphatic system and/or blood circulation, causing complications of the whole body organs and becoming the main cause of damage to the extra-pancreatic organs. (1) changes in the heart: a. enzymatic substances directly damage the heart muscle. b. insufficient circulation of blood. c. lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytic cells infiltrate the myocardium. d. damaged cardiomyocytes release intracellular potassium ions, resulting in transient local hyperkalemia and affecting myocardial depolarization. an abnormal electrocardiogram appears, but blood potassium does not necessarily increase at this time. e. abdominal pain can cause coronary vasospasm, arrhythmia, etc. through vagus nerve reflex, and cardiogenic shock can occur. f. pancreatic enzyme enters the pericardium through the lymphatic system to cause epicardial fat necrosis, pericarditis or pericardial effusion. g. hypocalcemia occurs, affecting the conduction system of the myocardium. (2) the mechanism of shock: a. intense abdominal pain. b. vomiting, intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal exudation and other factors can cause insufficient circulating blood volume. c. myocardium is damaged. d. massive bleeding in the pancreas, peripancreatic and gastrointestinal tract. e. infection poisoning. (3). mechanism of impaired respiratory function: a. tissue breakdown products (vasoactive kinins) cause damage to the capillary wall of the alveoli. b. phospholipase can reduce the amount of alveolar surfactant-active phospholipids, causing poor inflation of the alveoli and forming a state of atelectasis. c. abdominal pain, ascites, abdominal distension, etc. cause diaphragmatic movement limitation, and there is exudation in the chest cavity, which affects the inflation and exchange of the lower alveoli. d. triacylglycerol decomposes to release a large amount of free fatty acids, which reduces lung compliance.common pathological changes in the lungs are: opening of the arteriovenous short circuit in the lung, thereby destroying the capillaries of the alveolar membrane, and extravasation of the pulmonary blood vessels to form pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema.pulmonary interstitial edema, especially edema around the bronchioles, reduces lung ventilation and also affects or limits inflation. severe edema can cause alveolar collapse and is difficult to reverse.","['acute abdomen', 'diabetes', 'inflammation', 'upper abdominal pain', 'umbilical skin blue-purple spots', 'disgusting', 'dehydration', 'peritonitis']",['diffuse intravascular coagulation'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
multiple sclerosis,"multiple sclerosis (ms) is an autoimmune disease characterized by central nervous system (cns) white matter demyelinating lesions, genetically susceptible individuals and environmental factors.ms is the most common and most common disease in the central nervous system demyelinating diseases. it is more common in young and middle-aged patients. the clinical features are widespread spread of lesions. the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve damage are often relieved during the course of the disease.","this disease usually occurs in people aged 25-40.it slowly evolves and may disappear for a period of time, with intermittent recurrence, and the symptoms of recurrence tend to be more severe.stress, stress and malnutrition are likely to cause this disease. therefore, it is especially important to prevent the recurrence of multiple sclerosis and avoid various causes. daily protective health measures 1 prevention of colds and colds is a major cause of repeated illness in ms patients. therefore, when weather changes, timely addition and subtraction of clothing to avoid exposure to influenza is particularly important. in addition, appropriate diet can be selected to prevent colds. 2 avoid fatigue, excessive fatigue, and overload exercise is not advisable for patients with ms. 3 avoid high temperature, avoid extremely hot water bath, or excessive warm environment, so as not to cause this disease.","ms is known to be family-oriented, with approximately 15% of ms patients having at least one relative who is ill, with the highest recurrence rate in the patient's siblings (5%), and about 20% of the probands have at least one affected relative. among them, the patient's siblings are the most dangerous. viral infection is indeed the initial cause of ms, so some secondary factors must play a role in the later life to activate the nervous system lesions or cause deterioration. the most popular opinion is that this secondary mechanism is to attack the myelin sheath. certain components, in severe cases, destroy autoimmune responses characterized by all nerve fibers including axons, and several theories support this view. ms genetic susceptibility may be determined by the interaction of most weak-acting genes to determine the risk of ms. the genetic information is mainly from the study of twins. one of the most detailed studies reports the diagnosis of ms in 35 pairs of monozygotic twins. there are 12 (34%) pairs, only 2 pairs (4%) of the 49 pairs of double-oval twins, there are two pairs of clinically normal single-oval twins, mri shows lesions, in families with more than one member of the disease a certain genetic pattern has not been found. in most cases, the high incidence of a disease in a family is considered to be hereditary, but sometimes it may only reflect several members of the same family and be exposed to some common under the same conditions. environmental factors. pathogenesis some tissue-associated antigens (hla) were found to be more common in ms patients, suggesting that the genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of ms, and the more closely related to the dr site on chromosome 6, the hla antigen is abundant in ms (hla- dr2) and rare hla-dr3, hla-b7 and hla-a3 are considered to be markers of ms susceptibility genes. if one organism carries one of these antigens, the susceptibility to ms increases by 3 to 5 times. these antigens have been proof is related to the onset of ms, but its exact role is still poorly understood. the appearance of the brain is generally normal, but the surface of the spinal cord may be uneven, the brain and spinal cord sections appear scattered, slightly depressed, and the white pink lesions of the star pink due to the loss of myelin sheath, the lesion size ranges from 1 mm to several centimeters. these lesions are located in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, and do not exceed the entry zone of the spinal nerves and cranial nerve roots. because of their distinct contours, french pathologists call them sclerosing plaques. the distribution of lesions has a certain regularity. the lesions are mostly located around the ventricles, especially in the subventricular zone around the ventricles (mainly near the ventricle and the lateral ventricle). other vulnerable structures are the optic nerve and optic chiasm (but rarely affects the optic tract), the soft vein of the spinal cord is adjacent to the white matter, and the lesion is randomly distributed in the brainstem, the spinal cord and the cerebellar arm without focusing on a certain fiber, in the cerebral cortex, the central nucleus in the group and spinal cord structure, the lesion destroys the myelin sheath but the nerve cells remain relatively intact. the histological manifestations of the lesion depend on the time of the lesion. the relatively new lesion is composed of many focal demyelination areas around the vein. some or all of the myelin sheath in the lesion area is destroyed or lost, while the axon is relatively retained. there are varying degrees of oligodendrocyte degeneration, glial cell reactions (stellate cells) and perivascular, paracranial mononuclear cells and lymphocytes exuding, late, a large number of small glial phagocytic cells (macrophages) infiltration, the size of the astrocytes in and around the lesion increases, and the number increases. on the other hand, the old lesions are composed of densely thickened glial plaques, and lymphoid and macrophages are occasionally visible around the blood vessels; axons remain relatively intact, axonal retention prevents wallerian degeneration, and undamaged axons produce partial remyelination, which is the histological cause of ""shadow repair"" of imaging demyelinating spots. the shape, size, and histology of the new and old lesions at different levels were seen throughout the clinical course.","['resident doctor', 'brain white matter degeneration',

fecal incontinence,"incontinence of the fetus, copracrasia refers to the inability of feces and gas to be controlled at will, and involuntarily flows out of the anus. it is a symptom of defecation dysfunction, also known as fecal incontinence. the incidence of anal incontinence is not high, but it is not uncommon.although it does not directly threaten life, it causes physical and mental pain to the patient and seriously interferes with normal life and work.","1. develop good bowel habits and regular bowel movements. it is advisable to take a bowel movement after getting up in the morning. do not take too long to squat toilets.get rid of bad habits such as reading bowel readings and reading newspapers. 2, anal monday is not suitable for early treatment because the anus has its physiological and pathological features, not only wrinkles around, sebaceous glands and sweat glands are also many, plus a large number of bacteria in the discharge of stool, it is easy to induce infection, so once found anal discomfort or pain should be treated promptly to prevent the patient from getting worse. 3, keep the stool smooth and drink plenty of water every day, especially in the morning to drink a large cup of warm water.pay attention to adjusting your diet and eat more vegetables and fruits containing more cellulose.don't drink a lot, don't eat spicy, hot and irritating food. 4, the choice of underwear, toilet paper should be scientific underwear should choose soft and thin cotton products, do not wear coarse cloth or chemical fiber products.hand paper should be thin, soft, and evenly pleated. do not use waste paper or waste paper that has been written with a ballpoint pen.long-term stimulation of the ink can cause perianal disease. 5, do not ignore the anus cleaning every day to flush the anus twice, once after the stool is washed immediately, and the other is to wash before going to bed, so as not to contaminate the underwear. 6, regular bathing bath is a good way for anal health and treatment.a slight anal disorder, the bath will receive significant results.it is required that the water temperature should not be overheated to avoid burns, but it should not be too cold to function. the bathing time is generally not less than 20 to 30 minutes. during this period, the water can be appropriately heated to promote perianal blood circulation and accelerate inflammation absorption. 7, pay attention to do a good anal exercise daily best morning and evening to do an anal exercise, drive the perineum to do a shrinking exercise, each time doing 50 to 100 times, can promote venous blood reflux near the anorectal. 8, in life, if you do not pay attention to anal health care, it is prone to anal fissure, anal fistula, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, inflammation around the anus, abscess around the anus and other diseases, often affecting the overall health.therefore, we should pay attention to anal health care.","1. nervous system developmental defects: congenital lumbosacral sacral bulging or spondylolisthesis may be associated with anal incontinence, the patient's external sphincter and puborectalis muscle lose normal innervation, have no contractile function, are in a state of relaxation, and because of the sensory and motor system all affected, the rectal mucosa lacks the sense of swelling when the feces are filled, can not cause the intention and initiate the defecation movement, and the feces in the rectum are discharged at any time. this kind of sick child is often accompanied by urinary incontinence. 2. anorectal malformation: the anorectal itself and the pelvic structure are changed, and the higher the rectal blind end, the more obvious the change, the more complicated, the high blindness of the rectum is located above the basin, and the puborectalis muscle shortens, obviously the anterior superior displacement; the internal sphincter is absent or only in the primordial state; the external sphincter is mostly loose, filled with adipose tissue, and the muscle fibers are abnormally disordered. some 225 anorectal malformations were followed up by the author, 80 cases (35.5%) there are different degrees of filth or incontinence. the higher the deformity position, the higher the incidence of incontinence. the cause is mainly related to the deformity accompanied by the defects of sensory and motor tissue structure, and also has obvious relationship with surgical injury and surgical errors. in the past, when treating high-level malformation abdominal abdomen anusplasty, the rectum did not pass the puborectal muscle ring, but fell behind it, anorectal malformation, especially high malformation with humeral deformity, and neurological deficits are not uncommon, according to jiehioiiikhh analysis, about 10% of postoperative anal incontinence belong to this cause, anal incontinence after middle and low deformity, the main cause is surgical injury,infection and other factors, such as cloaca malformation, mainly for the rectal anal canal of the baby girl, urethra, vaginal acupuncture, and high incontinence infants often have fecal incontinence, congenital dementia, meningocele, multiple hard fecal incontinence can occur in skin diseases and the like. as a result of trauma, the anorectal ring is damaged, causing the sphincter to lose its sphincter function and to incontinence, such as stab wounds, cuts, burns, frostbite and laceration (mainly for perineal tears during maternal delivery), and anal canal injury of rectal surgery, such as anal fistula, hernia, rectal prolapse, rectal cancer, etc., damages the anal sphincter and causes incontinence. the most common are anorectal tumors; such as rectal cancer, anal canal cancer, crohn's disease invading the anorectal rectum and involving the anal sphincter, or ulcerative colitis caused by long-term diarrhea causing anal canal, or rectal prolapse the anal relaxation caused by the anus and the severe scar of the perianal area affect the anal sphincter, which can cause fecal incontinence when the anus is insufficiency. more common in brain trauma, brain tumors, cerebral infarction, spinal cord tumors, spinal tuberculosis, cauda equina injury, etc. can lead to fecal incontinence. (two) pathogenesis pathophysiology defecation is a process in which multiple systems of the human body participate in coordination and uniformity. the feces reach the rectum. first, the rectum must have a certain compliance. the feces are accepted, and the normal is 250ml. after the rectal contents reach a certain amount, the rectal receptors are stimulated. into the nerve fiber afferent center, and then through the efferent nerve fiber to the external sphincter and levator ani muscle, the central judgment conditions permit, at this time the external sphincter relaxation, increased intra-abdominal pressure to complete defecation, for some reason does not allow defecation, then the external sphincter compresses the internal sphincter by random contraction, and the internal sphincter reverse-reflexively inhibits rectal contraction, thereby rectal dilatation, volume enlargement, or pushing the feces back to the sigmoid colon by rectal peristalsis, which disappears freely. this external contraction of the external sphincter stimulation of the inner sphincter reverse inhibition rectal contraction is called random inhibition, defecation is a very complicated process, any link can be damaged can cause fecal incontinence, such as low compliance of the rectum can lead to serious increase in stool frequency, even fecal incontinence , high compliance, can increase the rectal volumepatients with constipation, such as fecal incontinence, as well as abnormal rectal receptor inhibition reduce the arbitrariness may also occur, or damage to the external sphincter fecal incontinence may occur, in short, many reasons for fecal incontinence, but also to be further explored. 2. classification (1) classification by degree: according to different degrees of fecal incontinence: can be divided into complete and incomplete anal incontinence 2, 1 incomplete anal incontinence: rare stool and gas can not be controlled, but dry stool can be controlled, 2 complete sexual anal incontinence: dry stools, loose stools and gas can not be controlled. (2) classification by nature: according to the nature of anal incontinence, divided into sensory incontinence and exercise incontinence, 1 sensory anal incontinence: normal morphology of the anal sphincter, but lack of sensation in the lower rectum, such as spinal cord or central nervous system dysfunction anal incontinence; or anal incontinence caused by a serious increase in rectal compliance, severe stool frequency, 2 motor anal incontinence: mainly damage to the anorectal sphincter damage the anorectal ring, resulting in patients not being able to control anal incontinence caused by stool.","['anal sphincter relaxation', 'anal relaxation', 'anal skin with eczema',  'anal deformity', 'smelly stool']",['aphid vaginitis'],"['surgery', 'anorectal']","['surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
children's learning ability disorder,"learning disabilities are also known as special developmental disorders.it refers to a type of developmental disorder children, mainly in the development of speech, learning skills (including reading, pinyin, calculations, etc.), motor skills and other aspects of development delay, performance and its actual intelligence level has a significant gap.however, it is not caused by severe mental retardation, sensory organ defects, emotional disorders or lack of learning opportunities. it may be secondary or associated with a sexual disorder or a direct emotional consequence.children with special developmental disabilities are often unable to receive education in ordinary schools and require special education.more common to boys include specific dyslexia, specific spelling disorders, and specific computational skills barriers.the course of the disease is not as characterized by many other mental disorders as remission and recurrence, which seriously affects the child's learning effect.","among the primary and middle school students whopreventlearning disabilities, emotional problems and lack of motivation are the main reasons.early detection and early treatment are the key. it requires the combination of family, school and clinical care, and adopts educational intervention and medical integration measures. 1. the child's own prevention of students' disgusting emotions often stems from negative self-concepts and interpersonal relationships. (1) development of learning potential training content specifically includes: 1) physical and mental basic training with the development of brain potential as the core; 2) training and learning ability training, focusing on teaching students to effectively receive information, processing information and reflection; 3) social adaptability training, that is, migration activities, applying the principles, laws, and methods realized in operational training to their respective studies, work, in life. (2) the essence of sensory integration training is to let the children participate in the form of games to enrich the child's feelings and stimuli.children with irregular nervous system development can't accept their feelings in play.during the guidance and training of the sensory integrated therapist, the child is given a variety of stimuli such as vestibular, muscle, joint, skin pressure, vision, hearing, and scent, and combines this stimulation with exercise. 2. family prevention parents are important to improve their educational methods for their children so that they can maintain a good learning mood. parents can suppress or reduce the problems of children with learning difficulties to some extent by using emotionally warm parenting methods.therefore, parents of children with learning difficulties should communicate with their children in a timely manner, increase emotional communication, and establish a harmonious and democratic family atmosphere.parents can help children to establish a targeted study and life plan and give specific guidance during the implementation process.","the cause is unknown and may be related to the following factors: 1. genetic factors.gene linkage analysis suggested that there are gene loci that are inherited by autosomal display on the 15th pair of chromosomes; gene loci on the sixth chromosome have also been reported.some scholars have used binaural sounding technology, electrophysiological method cortical blood flow analysis, transversal half field of view and other methods to study brain function lateralization and found that children with dyslexia have brain structure lateralization abnormalities, which may be abnormal in fetal blood testosterone levels. due to dysplasia. 2, organic factors.some people think that it is caused by vestibular dysfunction in the inner ear.negative life events of parents and families can exacerbate such problems. 3. environmental factors and nutritional factors. 4. other factors.in the process of processing such children's writing system, abnormalities or defects occur; or the literacy mode is abnormal or the language path is abnormal.there are different opinions on the relationship between the characteristics of the characters and the difficulty of reading.","['learning disabilities', 'learning difficulties']",['phobia'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric synthesis']","['psychological treatment', 'drug treatment']"

(b) the suppuration phase: the liquefaction zone is fused to form an abscess. (c) the formation period of the capsule: after 3 to 4 weeks, the granules, fibrous connective tissue and glial cells form a capsule around the abscess, and the capsules are thick and thin, and the brain tissue around the capsule is edematous. the abscess continues to increase, and the surrounding tissue is compressed, which can produce localized signs. if it collapses into the nearby ventricle or subarachnoid space, it forms severe ventriculitis and meningitis, and even causes fatal fulminant meningitis. if the intracranial pressure rises significantly high, brain tissue shift, then the formation of cerebral palsy, temporal lobe abscess often occurs in the cerebellar incision, cerebellar abscess is more common in the occipital foramen, can occur breathing, rapid cardiac arrest and rapid death.","['brain abscess', 'coma', 'meningeal irritation', 'low fever', 'increased intracranial pressure', 'meningitis']",['meningitis'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"

cancer and mediastinal tumor, also occasionally seen in pericardium, malignant tumor of the heart and pleura. traumatic paralysis of the sacral nerve involves mediastinal surgery, including mediastinal tumor, lung cancer, pericardial resection, coronary artery bypass grafting, open heart surgery, etc., all of which may damage or even cut the phrenic nerve, various types of chest injury, baby neck during childbirth excessive traction, etc., may also damage the phrenic nerve. due to trauma, tumor, cervical vertebra hyperplasia or intervertebral disc disease and cervical tuberculosis, the phrenic nerve is compressed or damaged at the level of the cervical 3-5. brain stem disease involves the respiratory center that supports the phrenic nerve, infectious polyradiculitis, etc., and can even cause paralysis of the phrenic nerve. polio, herpes zoster, diphtheria and other diseases can cause paralysis of the phrenic nerve. massive lymph node tuberculosis, mediastinal inflammation, etc. can damage the phrenic nerve, but it is very rare in clinical practice. occasionally, chest surgery accidentally injured the nerve. motor neuron diseases, tuberculosis, pericarditis, mediastinal inflammation, pneumonia, lead poisoning, etc., such as giant aortic aneurysm caused by left phrenic nerve paralysis, some patients can not find a clear cause of radial nerve palsy. pathogenesis 1. pathological changes the diaphragmatic paralysis makes the diaphragm in a relaxed state. due to the negative pressure of the pleural cavity, the diaphragm is passively prolonged and bulged. the long-term diaphragmatic paralysis can produce a diaphragm of the diaphragm atrophy, and finally form an acquired bulging sac. the diaphragm-like diaphragm and abdominal organs are obviously inflated into the thoracic cavity. 2. pathophysiology diaphragm paralysis can be unilateral, bilateral, complete or incomplete, unilateral complete diaphragmatic paralysis increases diaphragmatic muscles and contradictory movements (inflamed side of the affected side of the diaphragm muscles and the healthy side declines), but due to the contralateral diaphragmatic muscle compensation, the lung capacity is only reduced by about 30%. because the human lung ventilation function has a large reserve capacity, it has no effect on the ventilation in calm state or mild to moderate exercise. the left diaphragmatic paralysis may have hernia due to the elevation of the fundus. digestive tract symptoms such as abdominal distension and abdominal pain. when bilateral bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis occurs, the diaphragm is completely relaxed. because the relationship between the intercostal muscles and the auxiliary inspiratory muscles and the diaphragm is in series, the intercostal muscles and the auxiliary inspiratory muscles cannot it has a better compensatory effect on diaphragmatic paralysis. due to the ascending muscles during inhalation, the contractile force of the intercostal muscles and the auxiliary inspiratory muscles cannot be well converted into the negative pressure of the pleural cavity, while the negative pressure in the thoracic cavity is greater. the extent depends on the passive pulling force when the diaphragm is rising (this is the theoretical basis for the treatment of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis by diaphragmatic folding), so when the bilateral complete diaphragmatic paralysis is reduced, the vital capacity is usually reduced by more than 80%, resting state.the ventilation is also significantly affected, resulting in significant dyspnea and respiratory failure, due to limited lung expansion, prone to atelectasis and repeated lung infections.","['respiratory failure', 'difficulty breathing', 'difficulty swallowing', 'lung insufficiency',

guillain-barre syndrome,"guillain-barr谷 syndrome (gbs) is a serious disease common in the nervous system. the main lesions are in the spinal nerve roots and spinal nerves, which can affect the cranial nerves.associated with viral infection or autoimmune response.the clinical manifestations are acute, symmetrical, and flaccid limb paralysis.","1. the disease is self-limiting, single-phase course, after several weeks or months of recovery, 70% to 75% of patients completely recover, 25% left a slight neurological deficit, 5% died, often died of respiratory failure, jejunum patients with campylobacter infection have a poor prognosis, and the prognosis is poor in elderly patients with acute onset or assisted ventilation. 2. pay attention to personal cleanliness, hygiene, washing hands, avoiding raw food, etc. will reduce the infection of campylobacter jejuni, thus avoiding acute motor axonal neuropathy.","so far, the cause of gbs is still not very clear. the earliest thought that infection and poisoning are the cause of the disease, 40% of patients have pre-infection, and the prodromal factors are as follows. 1. virus and gbs: in 1983, hurroiz reported 1034 cases of gbs, 70% had prodromal factors, and 2/3 were viral infections, mainly manifested as upper sensation or diarrhea. it is generally believed that cytomegalovirus, eb virus, influenza virus, etc. have there is a great relationship, and there are reports that are closely related to hepatitis virus. liu xiumei reported 4 cases of acute hepatitis with gbs in 1988. in addition, xu xianhao reported 6/500 of gbs in hepatitis b patients, which was significantly higher than that of the control group. among the 100 cases of hepatitis b absag positive, gbs there were 17 cases of onset, and 1 case of gbs occurred in 45 cases of the control group. 2. campylobacter jejuni and gbs: in 1982, rhodes reported 1 case of gbs. the stool culture and antibody test confirmed that the jejunum is secondary to gbs. in 1984, another scholar reported 56 cases of gbs with campylobacter jejuni infection, 21 cases in china. in 1993, jian et al first reported that campylobacter jejuni infection was the main precursor of gbs in china. 71% of 17 cases of gbs had gastrointestinal infection symptoms, and the positive rate of serum jejunal igm antibody was 53%, which was higher than that of foreign literature. the relationship between campylobacter jejuni and gbs has become the focus of gbs research. 3. vaccination and gbs: a group of 1034 cases of gbs have 4.5% vaccination, more common in influenza vaccine, hepatitis vaccine, measles vaccination after the onset, our department in 1995 admitted a case of hepatitis a vaccine after vaccination gbs. 4. genetics and gbs: it has been reported that the frequency of a3 and b8 genes in gbs patients is significantly increased, and gbs is considered to have a certain relationship with heredity. 5. trace elements and gbs: zhang xiangjian reported that there are trace elements zn, cu, fe metabolism abnormalities in gbs patients, and it is believed that trace elements are abnormal, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of gbs.","['muscle beating', 'dyspnea', 'swallowing disorder', 'sputum reflex disappeared', 'co-deficiency', 'cranial nerve palsy', 'autonomic dysfunction', 'hypokate', 'cranial nerve damage ', 'feeling obstacle']",['depression'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['symptom treatment', 'drug treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
hepatolenticular degeneration,"hepatolenticular degeneration is a hereditary disease mainly caused by adolescents, caused by copper metabolism disorders.it is characterized by cirrhosis, basal ganglia softening and degeneration, corneal pigment ring (kayser-fleischer ring), accompanied by ceruloplasmin deficiency and amino aciduria.also known as wilson's disease.","1. prevention and treatment of this disease should be diagnosed early, correct the positive balance of copper metabolism in patients, pay attention to reduce the copper content of food (<1mg / d), limit the diet containing more copper, such as nuts, chocolate, peas, broad beans, corn , mushrooms, shells and snails, honey, animal liver and blood, high amino acid, high protein diet can promote urinary copper excretion. 2. determination of serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, urinary copper and copper content of skin fibroblasts in vitro in family members of wd patients can help to find homozygous and heterozygous wd symptoms before the symptoms, and the homozygotes can be detected early before symptoms. treatment, heterozygotes should be contraindicated to marry heterozygotes to avoid homozygote in their offspring, prenatal examination if found to be homozygous, should terminate the pregnancy to prevent the source of the patient.","etiology the basic cause of this disease is excessive deposition of copper in various tissues of the body, especially in the liver, brain, kidney, cornea, etc., leading to tissue damage and pathology. pathogenesis there are several theories about themechanismof hepatolenticular degeneration: 1 the normal substance defects in the bile of this type of patients combined with copper may be the deficiency of chenodeoxycholic acid and taurine, leading to bile secretion of copper dysfunction. evidence that does not support this doctrine is that there is no qualitative change in bile copper-binding protein in this class of patients, and there is no evidence of abnormal bile acid metabolism in such patients. 2 abnormalities in the synthesis of copper-binding protein in the liver, resulting in increased affinity of the protein for copper. the evidence supporting this theory is that the binding constant of copper-binding protein (hepatic copper protein) to copper in patients with wilson disease is a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. the constant is 4 times, but people have questioned the analysis method of data. therefore, whether the high affinity of abnormal protein for copper in wilson's disease is the formation mechanism of wilson's disease needs further clarification. 3 the most reasonable theory is that the lysosomes of liver cells participate in the metabolic process of copper. it is observed that the lysosomal content of liver cells in patients with wilson disease is 40 times higher than that of the control, and the lysosomal defects of liver cells in patients with wilson disease are considered. it interferes with the process by which copper is secreted by lysosomes into the bile, resulting in an increase in copper in the liver of patients with wilson's disease. in short, wilson's disease is not due to increased absorption of copper in the intestine, but due to the biliary tract barrier to copper secretion. this disorder is congenital. patients with genetic defects cannot undergo positive balance metabolism in the 3 months after birth. normal, the copper positive equilibrium metabolism persists, resulting in the accumulation of copper in the body. pathological changes of a liver the earliest histological changes were glycogen degeneration in the hepatocytes of the peri-lobular area under light microscopy. the nucleus glycogen is agglomerated or vacuolated and has a moderate degree of fat infiltration. the fat droplets are composed of triglycerides, and the number of fat droplets increases and the fusion increases. steatosis is similar in morphology to alcoholic steatosis. the organelles that coexist with steatosis or have undergone lesions before steatosis are mitochondria, with increased mitochondria volume, membrane separation, sputum expansion, crystallographic arrangement, vacuoles, the matrix is significantly granular. mitochondrial changes may be associated with steatosis in pathogenesis. with the treatment of d-penicillamine, mitochondrial changes can be alleviated or even disappeared, indicating that changes in mitochondria are caused by the toxic effects of copper. the rate of change of the liver from fat infiltration to cirrhosis varies greatly from person to person. some patients may develop chronic active hepatitis, may have mononuclear cell infiltration, mostly lymphocytes and plasma cells, may have clastic necrosis, and this necrosis may cross the boundary plate, may have liver parenchyma collapse, bridging necrosis it is distinguished from liver fibrosis, a chronic active hepatitis. liver lesions can be naturally relieved, and can progress to large nodular cirrhosis or rapidly develop into fulminant hepatitis, which is poorly treated. in the process of cirrhosis, there may be inflammatory cell infiltration or substantial necrosis of the liver parenchyma, eventually forming cirrhosis with large nodular or large nodule nodules. the fiber separation can be wide or narrow, bile duct hyperplasia, but also accompanied by there are some pathological changes in the early stage of wilson's disease such as ribosome degeneration and steatosis. second, the whole nervous system of thebraincan be involved, and the nucleus, the nucleus, the caudate nucleus, the insula and the nucleus are more heavily involved, and the nucleus is the most prominent in the lenticular nucleus. the cerebral hemisphere can be atrophied to varying degrees, the lenticular nucleus shrinks, softens, and forms small cavities. histology shows degeneration and necrosis of nerve cells, astrocyte hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and degeneration. third, kidney copper in the proximal convoluted tubules, showing fatty degeneration and watery degeneration. fourth, the corneal copper deposition forms a brown-green pigmentation around the descemet membrane behind the cornea, called the kayser-fleischer ring.","['attention is not concentrated', 'powerless', 'stationary doctor', 'hepatic nucleus

""gap"", in which the accumulation of tissue fluid, coupled with the hemorrhage caused by micro-damage, makes this bloody fluid mechanized and then calcified, ossified, thus forming the epiphysis, the relaxation of the anterior and posterior ligaments of the vertebral body, and the cervical vertebrae stable, increased the chance of trauma, the bones gradually increased, the epiphysis together with the bulging fibrous annulus, the posterior longitudinal ligament and the edema or fibrous scar tissue caused by the traumatic reaction, forming a protrusion at the equivalent of the intervertebral disc the mixture into the spinal canal may have an oppressive effect on the spinal nerve or spinal cord. the epiphysis of the hook joint can protrude from the anterior to the posterior to the intervertebral foramen to compress the nerve root and the vertebral artery. the epiphysis of the anterior border of the vertebral body generally does not cause symptoms, but there is also a report that the anterior epiphysis affects swallowing or hoarseness in the literature. after the spinal cord and nerve roots are compressed, they are only functional changes at the beginning. if the pressure is not relieved in time, the irreversible changes will gradually occur. therefore, if non-surgical treatment is ineffective, surgery should be performed promptly. supplementary note: cervical spondylosis is mainly caused by degenerative changes of the cervical disc and cervical vertebrae and their accessory structures. the pathogenesis of cervical spondylosis, like lumbar disc herniation, cannot be explained by mechanical compression alone, and vascular and chemical factors are at work, causing edema and inflammation or aggravating neurological symptoms.","['neck twisting pain', 'right leg numbness', 'neck-heart syndrome', 'arm numbness', 'shoulder back heavy feeling', 'cervical vertebral curvature straightening', 'cervical vertebral arch', 'neck pain', 'face of lightning', 'hands and feet numb']",['autonomic dysfunction'],"['surgery', 'orthopaedic surgery']","['supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'medicine treatment']"
stiff man syndrome,"stiff mandy syndrome (sms) is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by muscle undulation, progressive stiffness and paroxysmal cramps. the stiff syndrome was first described by moersch and woltman (1956). to date, only a few cases of sms patients with cancer and glutamate decarboxylase circulating antibodies (anti-gad antibodies) have been reported, in 10 patients among them, 6 cases showed specific antibodies against the 128kda antigen. the antibodies were co-expressed by neuronal cytoplasm and tumors. the cancers with this antibody were diverse, especially breast cancer, and also found in colon cancer and hodgkin disease.","there is no special precautionary method for early diagnosis and treatment of possible autoimmune-related diseases such as pernicious anemia, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, leukoplakia, insulin-dependent diabetes, etc.; and breast cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer such as malignant tumors.","the etiology of sms has so far been unclear and rare autosomal dominant inheritance. solimena (1988) suggested that its pathogenesis may be related to autoimmunity. the literature reports that sms may be associated with autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, leukoplakia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, etc. some patients have a history of infection before the disease, and their cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes, proteins or immunoglobulins are slightly elevated. it has been reported that 60% of sms cases have anti-gad antibodies, and most of the patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without neurological damage can also find this antibody. all of the above suggest that autoimmune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of sms, and patients with sms have muscle rigidity. the cause is unclear, and some of these patients may be caused by damage to the spinal cord neurons. sms can also be associated with malignant tumors such as breast cancer, lymphoma, and lung cancer, so it is called a paraneoplastic syndrome. the pathogenesis of 60% to 70% of sms patients with serum and cerebrospinal fluid increased anti-glutamate decarboxylase (gad) autoantibodies, schmierer found that gad antibody-negative patients have a neuron presynaptic membrane 12b-kd protein antibodies, as for the role of these antibodies in the disease is still unclear, plasma exchange and immunosuppressive drug treatment can relieve some patients with symptoms, the above findings suggest that the disease may be an autoimmune disease. alpha motoneurons are controlled by the excitatory catecholaminergic nervous system and the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) energy system. sms may cause muscle stiffness and clonicity due to the imbalance between the two, based on the patient's urinary noradrenal gland. the metabolite methoxypoxyethanol (mhpg) is significantly elevated. the clinical application of diazepam has achieved good efficacy and the discovery of gad antibodies. diazepam can inhibit the activity of catecholamine nerves, reduce the excitability of 汐 motor neurons, and enhance the center of gaba. inhibition, the urinary mhpg decreased, gad is the endoplasmic enzyme of gabaergic nerve, which converts glutamate into gaba; the increase of gad antibody may affect the synthesis or dysfunction of gaba, and the inhibition of gaba is reduced. scholars believe that the mechanism of sms muscle stiffness may be inhibited by inhibitory interneurons, and excitatory interneurons are hyperactive. in short, the exact pathogenesis of this disease needs further study.","['plate-shaped abdomen', 'dyspnea', 'difficulty swallowing', 'foot varus', 'depression', 'muscle spasm pain', 'facial muscle rigidity', 'sensory disorder']",['depression'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

spinal cord compression,"spinal cord compression is a common disorder in the nervous system. it is a group of intraspinal lesions with space-occupying features.there is obvious progressive clinical manifestation of spinal cord compression. as the etiology develops and expands, the spinal cord, spinal nerve roots, and their supply vessels are oppressed and become increasingly severe, causing spinal cord edema, degeneration, necrosis and other pathological changes that will eventually lead to the spinal cord. loss of function, limb movement, reflex, sensation, sphincter function and skin dystrophy below the pressure plane, seriously affecting the patient's life and labor capacity. in general, if the disease is diagnosed and treated early, the prognosis is very good.therefore, it is necessary to popularize and raise awareness and attention to spinal cord compression.","there are many determinants of the prognosis of spinal cord compression, such as the nature of the lesion, the possibility and extent of decompression, such as extramedullary epidural tumors are benign, the prognosis of surgical resection is good; the prognosis of intramedullary tumors is poor, usually the shorter the compression time, the smaller the spinal cord dysfunction, the more likely it is to recover. the acute spinal cord compression can not fully play the compensatory function, and the prognosis is poor. the treatment is mainly to prevent the compression of the spinal cord from various primary diseases, and advocate early surgery to relieve spinal cord compression; neurotrophic metabolism drugs, such as b vitamins, vitamin e, citicoline, atp, coenzyme a, and nerve growth factor, may partially improve the function of the spinal cord.","(1) the cause of the disease is the most common tumor, accounting for more than 1/3 of the total number of spinal cord compression, vertebral body dislocation of the spinal injury, dislocation of the fracture piece and hematoma, inflammatory and parasitic granuloma, abscess, disc herniation, spinal cord vascular malformations and certain congenital spinal lesions can cause spinal cord compression. 1. tumor (1) originates from the spinal cord tissue itself and its accessory structures: the vast majority, includingtumorsfrom the spinal nerve, spinal cord membrane, spinal cord glial cells, spinal cord blood vessels and fat connective tissue around the spinal cord, of which nearly half ( about 47.13%) are schwannomas, including a small number of neurofibromas, followed by meningioma, which is considered to be a malignant spinal glioma, accounting for only 10.87%. in addition, some congenital tumors, such as skin samples. cysts, epithelioid cysts and teratomas also occur, and the spinal epidural adipose tissue is abundant, so the occurrence of lipoma is not uncommon. tumors can occur in any part of the spinal canal, but the thorax is in the thoracic segment. more common, congenital tumors are more lumbosacral. (2) malignant tumors originating from the spine and other organs: can also be invaded, transferred to the spinal canal and involve the spinal cord, in which malignant tumors of the lungs, breasts, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract are common, and occasionally lymphoma, leukemia those who invade the spinal cord and develop spinal cord compression symptoms. 2. inflammation of bacterial infections in other parts of the body can be disseminated by blood, direct spread of suppurative lesions adjacent to the spine, and direct implantation (""iatrogenic"") can cause acute abscess or chronic truth in the spinal canal. granuloma and oppression of the spinal cord, more common in the epidural, subdural and intraspinal abscess is extremely rare, non-bacterial infective spinal arachnoiditis, as well as injury, bleeding, chemical such as intrathecal injection of drugs and arachnoiditis caused by unknown reasons, can cause spinal cord and inflammatory arachnoid adhesion, even arachnoid cysts and oppress the spinal cord, in addition, some specific inflammation such as tuberculosis, parasitic granuloma, etc. can cause spinal cord compression. 3. injury of spinal cord injury often involves spinal cord injury, and spinal injury can be caused by vertebral body, vertebral arch and lamina fracture, dislocation, facet joint interlacing, disc herniation, and intraspinal hematoma formation. 4. spinal vascular malformation due to abnormalities in congenital embryo development, acquired diseases such as inflammation, injury, atherosclerosis, etc. can cause spinal vascular malformations. so far, there is no strong data to confirm that spinal cord vascular malformation causes spinal dysfunction, except for deformed blood vessels. the expansion and expansion have an oppressive effect, and due to short circuit of the artery, venous congestion leads to ischemic spinal cord injury. 5. disc herniation, also known as nucleus pulposus, is also a common cause of spinal cord compression, often caused by excessive exertion or overextension of the spine, excessive flexion, caused by sneezing or forced coughing, resulting in disc herniation, this is it is rare, disc herniation can also be caused by dehydration and aging of the nucleus pulposus itself. it can be seen in the lower neck of the neck without obvious damage factors. it can have more than one nucleus pulposus at the same time. the disease course is long and the symptoms progress slowly. this is the spine. part of a degenerative lesion. 6. someothercongenital spinal disorders, such as skull base depression, atlanto-occipital pillow, cervical fusion, spina bifida, spinal cord bulging, scoliosis and severe hypertrophic spinal osteoarthritis cause spinal cord compression. (b) the pathogenesis of the spinal cord deep in the vertebral canal lumen, its tissue structure and biological characteristics similar to the brain tissue, rich in water, soft and fragile, incompressible, sensitive to blood oxygenation, etc. characteristics, these characteristics determine the pathological changes and clinical features of the spinal cord for oppressive and ischemic damage. from the pathogenesis, different compression factors and their development speed determine the clinical manifestations. generally speaking, the influence of any kind of oppression on the spinal cord is always two-fold. one is mechanical compression and the other is blood supply disorder. the effect caused by mechanical factors is fast, symptoms appear almost immediately, and the damage is strong. after the pressure is relieved, the function recovery is slow, it usually takes several hours, and it can be gradually recovered after a few days. the various tissues of the spinal cord itself have different tolerance to stress. the tolerance of gray matter is generally larger than that of white matter. the thick nerve fibers in the conduction beam the tolerance to compression is worse than that of fine fibers, so it is easy to be damaged. the nerve fibers of the sense of touch and proprioception are relatively thick (12 to 15 米m in diameter), and the nerve fibers of pain and temperature are fine (2 to 5 米m in diameter). when both are under pressure, the former has symptoms earlier, but after the compression is relieved, the recovery is faster and more complete. generally speaking, the longer the process from spinal cord compression to complete sexual dysfunction, the complete sexual dysfunction continues. the shorter the time, the faster the function recovery after the release of compression, the more complete, the effect of blood supply disorder is slow, the symptoms appear after blocking blood supply for 1 to 5 minutes, and the function recovery after recovery of blood supply is also fast, but if the blood supply is finished after more than 10 minutes of blockage, the spinal cord will produce severe ischemia, and the function is difficult to recover. in the early stage of spinal cord compression, the blood circulation disorder is reversible, but the degree of compression is increased and the time becomes too long, it becomes irreversible, and the blood supply in the distribution area after the arteries are compressed insufficient, causing degeneration and softening of the spinal cord and congestion after venous compression, causing spinal cord edema, thereby aggravating spinal cord compression and damage. in tolerance to ischemia, white matter is more tolerant than gray matter, and fine fibers are stronger than crude fibers. clinical classification because of the speed of development of pathogenic factors, spinal cord compression can be divided into acute, subacute and chronic types. 1. acute compression is caused by multiple injuries (here, the formation of hematoma in the spinal canal or the compression of the spinal cord after injury), metastatic tumor, acute epidural abscess, intraspinal hemorrhage and other causes. the volume of the space in a short period of time (1 to 3 days) exceeds the reserve space of the spinal cavity of the compression site, and the following pathological changes occur. usually, venous return is blocked first, and the increase of venous pressure leads to excessive penetration of water. extravascular, intercellular water increases, nerve cells in the compression area, glial cells and axons edema, increased spinal cord volume, exacerbated compression, further development of lesions lead to arterial blood supply disorders, cellular tissue hypoxia, metabolic disorders the accumulation of acidic products, increased cell membrane permeability, destruction of intracellular, extracellular potassium, sodium ion exchange, intracellular calcium overload, organelle dissolution and other biophysical changes, fchlings and other multivariate regression analysis found spinal cord injury the degree and degree of ischemia are significantly associated with axonal conduction function after injury and will eventually lead to complete impairment of spinal cord function. under the microscope, the cell body and its axonal edema, intercellular fluid increase, cell and fibrosis, softening, breaking, dissolving liquefaction and necrosis, eventually forming fibrous connective tissue-like scar and arachnoid, dural adhesion, cerebrospinal fluid circulation blocked, the spinal cord below the compression plane is associated with loss of the central part, the cells gradually undergo atrophic changes, the nerve fibers are demyelinated, the spinal cord is reduced in size, and there is a different degree of adhesion to the arachnoid membrane. the above pathological changes have reached the end, which is the pathological basis of spinal cord function loss. the degree of compression is different from the stage of oppression, and the changes are different. if the degree of compression is lighter or earlier, the cells only have edema and mild edema. at this time, if the compression can be relieved, the damage is reversible. when the organelle has dissolved and the cell body and the cell are broken off, even if the compression factor is removed, the function is difficult to recover, and the lesion is most severe in the central area under pressure. 2. chronic compression this is a benign tumor in the spinal canal such as schwannomas, meningioma, lipoma, benign teratoma, cyst, etc., as well as spinal tuberculosis and some congenital spinal deformities, due to the slow development of the lesion, the spinal cord is not suddenly under pressure, while the lesion develops slowly, the spinal cord gradually acquires the ability to adapt and compensate for different degrees, or obtains sufficient blood supply due to the establishment of the collateral circulation, and can disappear from the adipose tissue in the spinal canal. tube enlargement, lamina, pedicle and vertebral body thinning, bone erosion and other changes, so that the spinal cord compression is reduced. the pathological changes of chronic compression are very different from those of acute compression. the cause of compression can exist for a considerable period of time. the spinal cord cavity is completely obstructed, and the spinal cord can still be free of obvious edema and swelling. on the contrary, the spinal cord becomes fine, and even the size is only half of the original or smaller, the spinal cord is pushed to one side and bowed, and the compressed part presents a concave indentation. the size of the spinal cord varies with the size of the lesion. the surface is slightly congested and has arachnoid different degrees of adhesion, nerve roots are pulled or oppressed, this is the pathological basis of root pain and segmental sensory or dyskinesia. the above pathological changes determine the following clinical features of chronic spinal cord compression. (1) compensatory: the spinal cord compression process is slow and gradually acquires the ability to adapt and compensate. for a long period of time (months to more than 1 year), clinical symptoms may not occur, and the symptoms often appear as the compression increases. orderly, extramedullary compression often first causes nerve root stimulation or damage symptoms, and may also cause corresponding damage symptoms due to compression of the immediately adjacent conduction beam, followed by a half-cut symptom of the spinal cord compression side, and finally lead to complete spinal cord function disorder. the whole process is often as long as 1 to 2 years. there are 2 cases of female schwannomas in the neurosurgery of renji hospital affiliated to shanghai second medical university. the lesions are 4 years and 7 years respectively. the examination confirmed that the spinal canal is completely blocked. however, the patient can still handle housework and go up and down the stairs. the spinal cord that has been seen in the operation has been compressed to about 1/3 of the original size, which is enough to explain the tolerance and compensatory ability of the spinal cord to chronic compression. (2) volatility: the chronic spinal cord compression process is long, and the general trend of clinical symptoms is increasing. however, some cases may not be aggravated after a certain symptom or a group of symptoms appear, and may not be aggravated, or even there are relief or alleviation, heavy and light, light and complex, can be repeated, the fluctuation of this symptom, common in cystic changes of the tumor, vascular tumors and disc herniation, some patients with schwannomas also have fluctuations sexual clinical manifestations, some are due to the relief of medication and physical therapy symptoms, the fluctuation of symptoms, if the curve shows that the peak is always higher than once, or accompanied by new symptoms or signs, the spinal cord will eventually appear complete impairment of function, (3) segmentality: the movement of the spinal cord and the sensory nerves have segmental characteristics. different segments of the spinal cord are compressed with different parts of the movement, sensory and reflex disorders, and extramedullary compression lesions appear early. root pain, ""meat jump"" is the performance and characteristics of this segmental device. (4) multiple: tumor-induced spinal cord compression is more common in single-shot, but occasionally multiple tumors simultaneously or sequentially compress different planes of the spinal cord, such as multiple neurofibromatosis and metastatic tumors, in addition, arachnoid cysts, inflammatory granuloma are also frequent. 3. subacute compression is between the acute and chronic oppression, and will not be repeated.","['back pain', 'feeling allergy', 'sphincter dysfunction', 'anal sphincter relaxation', 'breathing difficulty', 'muscle atrophy', 'constipation', 'feeling separation', 'hiccup', 'sensory disorder' ]",['decubitus'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord,"subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is a degenerative disease of the nervous system caused by vitamin b12 deficiency. its clinical manifestations include deep sensory loss, sensory ataxia and spastic paralysis with spinal cord and lateral cord lesions, often accompanied by peripheral nerve damage. and the peripheral sensation of the symptoms.the disease is related to the deficiency of vitamin b12, which is a structure that promotes nerve impulse conduction around the nerve, and vitamin b12 is an essential coenzyme for the formation of myelin and nucleoprotein. the lack of vitamin b12 may cause myelin synthesis disorder and cause neurological and psychotic lesions; and because vitamin b12 is also involved in the synthesis of hemoglobin, lack of it can lead to anemia.","this disease mainly involves the posterior and lateral cord of the spinal cord. if the disease can be treated with vitamin b12 within 3 months after the onset of the disease, it can often be fully recovered. if it is not treated symptomatically, it often progresses after 2-3 years of onset. even life-threatening, early diagnosis and timely treatment are the key to determining the prognosis of this disease.","the intake of vitamin b12 must be combined with the internal factors secreted by the cells in the stomach to form a stable complex, which will not be absorbed by the intestinal bacteria and absorbed at the distal end of the ileum. vitamin b12 intake, absorption, binding and transport occur at any point. obstacle. such as congenital defects of internal factor secretion, atrophic gastritis, major resection of the stomach, primary intestinal malabsorption, ileal resection, etc., will cause vitamin b12 deficiency, resulting in clinical symptoms. the disease is related to the deficiency of vitamin b12, which is a structure that promotes nerve impulse conduction around the nerve, and vitamin b12 is an essential coenzyme for the formation of myelin and nucleoprotein. the lack of vitamin b12 may cause myelin synthesis disorder and cause neurological and psychotic lesions; and because vitamin b12 is also involved in the synthesis of hemoglobin, lack of it can lead to anemia.","['toddling', 'sphincter dysfunction', 'sexual paraplegia gait', 'face pale', 'diarrhea', 'sexual muscle tone increase', 'illusion', 'lack of strength', 'job burnout ', 'tendon reflective advancement']",['paralysis'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
spinal vascular disease,"spinal vascular disease is a group of diseases in which spinal cord dysfunction is caused by occlusion or rupture of blood vessels supplying the spinal cord.the blood supply to the cervical spinal cord is from the vertebral artery, and the vertebral arteries on both sides merge into the anterior spinal artery.the thoracic spinal cord anterior artery descends.the thoracic spinal cord is supplied by the intercostal artery.the lower thoracic and lumbar spinal cords are supplied by the descending branches of the aorta and the branches of the internal iliac artery.the anterior spinal artery supplies 2/3 of the ventral side of the spinal cord, and the posterior spinal artery supplies the 1/3 of the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. the lateral side is supplied by the spinal cord artery.spinal cord 2 to 4 is the junction of the cervical vertebral artery and the thoracic spinal cord, and the blood supply is poor.","active treatment of the primary disease.pay attention to safety in production and life, and try to avoid trauma.once the disease has to be treated in time, early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment are the key to prevention.","myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, aortic rupture, aortic angiography, chest and remember, etc. cause severe hypotension, as well as atherosclerosis, syphilitic arteritis, tumor, arachnoid adhesions, etc. can lead to ischemic spinal cord disease.spontaneous hemorrhage is more common in spinal arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, blood diseases, tumors, and anticoagulant therapy.spinal vascular disease is often a complication of other diseases and is easily masked by the primary disease. it is a common spinal vascular disease. the deformed blood vessels can compress the spinal cord. the occlusion causes spinal cord ischemia. the rupture causes bleeding and the spinal cord function is impaired. about one third of the patients have lesional spinal cord segmental hemangioma, intracranial vascular malformation and syringomyelia. symptoms, etc. trauma is the main cause of intraspinal hemorrhage. pathophysiological spinal cord is more resistant to ischemia, and mild intermittent blood supply will not cause obvious damage to the spinal cord. complete ischemia for 15 minutes may cause irreversible damage to the spinal cord.thrombosis of the anterior spinal artery is common in the neck and thoracic marrow, and the segment is the weak area of blood supply; the left posterior artery of the spinal cord is one of the left and right, and thrombosis is rare.spinal cord infarction can lead to degeneration and necrosis of nerve cells, softening of gray matter and infiltration of perivascular lymphocytes, late thrombosis, replacement by fibrous tissue, and revascularization.intramedullary hemorrhage often invades several spinal cord segments, mostly located in the central gray matter; hemorrhage or blood enters the subarachnoid space outside the hemorrhage, tissue edema around the hemorrhage, blood stasis and secondary nerve tissue degeneration.spinal vascular malformations can occur in any segment of the spinal cord, consisting of dilated tortuous vessels forming a reticular vascular mass and its upper and lower feeding arteries and drainage veins.","['sensual ataxia', 'back pain', 'spinal shock', 'sphincter dysfunction', 'spinal compression', 'intermittent claudication', 'meningeal irritation', 'paraplegia', 'spinal infarction ', 'feeling obstacles']",['paraplegia'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
tension headache,"tension headache, also known as muscle contraction headache, is the most common type of headache. it is generally considered to have a higher prevalence than migraine, accounting for about half of the outpatient headaches, mainly for the neck and head and face muscles. the resulting head pressure and heavy feeling, some patients complained that the head has a ""tight"" feeling.","tension headache is the most common type of headache, so it is especially important to prevent tension headache. because the disease is related to long-term anxiety, nervousness and excessive fatigue, firstly avoid mental stimulation, regular life, prohibit smoking, alcohol, long-term in a bad working posture, so that the head, neck and shoulder muscles can continue to shrink the headache can also occur, so develop a good habits, proper physical exercise is necessary, and for long-term chronic headache patients, in addition to psychological treatment in addition, it can also be combined with sedation, analgesics such as diazepam, ibuprofen and other drugs.","(1) causes of the disease it is generally believed that tension headache is related to cranial muscle disease or mental headache. in the new classification, tth is further divided into two subtypes according to the time of headache attack and cranial muscle disease: 1. episodic tension-type (etth) (1)paroxysmal tension headacheassociated with craniocerebral muscle disease. (2) paroxysmal tension headaches that are not associated with craniocerebral muscle disorders. 2. chronic tension-type (ctth) (1) chronic tension-type headache associated with craniocerebral muscle disease. (2) chronic tension-type headaches that are not associated with craniocerebral muscle disorders. (b) the pathogenesis of tension headache although a common headache, but its pathogenesis has not yet been fully clarified, the recent research status is summarized as follows: 1. the relationship between tth and cranial muscle disease since the 1940, in the literature the relationship between the two is discussed, but whether the muscle disease is the cause or the result of tth, or just one of the factors in the pathogenesis of tth, has not yet been concluded. peterson et al (1995) studied a group of tth patients for site specificity in the head pain muscles when they had a headache. they used a subjective self-report rating to detect five muscles. including the pain of the frontal muscles, diaphragm, chewing muscles, head muscles and trapezius muscles and the degree of muscle tension, and observe the level of myoelectric activity of these muscles, although detailed quantitative observations were made for each muscle. the results did not find a significant relationship between muscle pain and muscle tension and the level of myoelectric activity. jensen et al. (1998) used 28 cases of subtype ctth and etth, which were quantified by tenderness, tenderness, and pain. the threshold and the myoelectric activity of the diaphragm and trapezius muscles were observed. the results showed that the patients with ctth with craniocerebral muscle disease had significant tenderness and allergic reactions to mechanical stimulation pain, that is, the more obvious the tenderness, the mechanical the more sensitive the irritation response is, and the myoelectric activity is also significantly increased, but there is no abnormality in the threshold of thermal pain stimulation. the above changes are not obvious in patients with etth. in recent years, bansevicius et al (1999) have muscle pain in patients with tth. correlation studies were also performed between pain, tension, and myoelectric response. the pain was measured on the forehead, left and right diaphragm, neck and left and right shoulder muscles using a visual analog scale (vas). at the same time, the superficial myoelectric activity of the part is traced, and the tension and fatigue are used to inquire, and the patient self-assessment is also recorded according to the vas method. through the above quantitative research, it is found that between fatigue and pain, there was a significant correlation during the whole experiment. tiredness was part of the headache, that is, the longer the headache, the more obvious the feeling of fatigue; but the correlation between tension and pain was weak, only relevant in the post-experimental period, and only seen in the neck. there is no correlation between muscle strength, muscle electrical activity and pain, between myoelectric activity and fatigue, tension and fatigue, so the authors believe that the role of tension in tth is not prominent. 2. the relationship between tth and psychological changes catheart et al. (1998) conducted an experimental study of biopsychology on the relationship between arousal-related mood and etth. they used activation-deactivation adjective check list (adacl). quantitative analysis of the energy, tiredness, tension, and calmness was performed. it was found that the level of stress in etth patients was higher than that in the control group, even in the absence of headache, and in non-headache in the period, the level of stress is significantly lower than the headache period, so it is considered that there is a relationship between tension and headache. 3. the relationship between tth and vascular headache because clinically, it can be found that tension headache and migraine occur in the same patient at the same time, and some patients initially show migraine. when the frequency of attack increases gradually, it shows etth and can be transferred. for ctth, there have been many reports on the relationship between these two types of headaches. for example, tackeshima et al. (1998) pointed out that there are many similarities between muscle contraction headache and migraine in reviewing the literature, such as clinical symptoms and characteristics can overlap each other. both platelet 5-ht can be decreased, plasma 5-ht can be elevated, and the sympathetic function of the peripheral autonomic nervous system can be low. genetic studies have found that the same family is biased. headaches and patients with muscle contraction headaches, etc. recently, hannerz et al (1998) proposed whether ctth is a vascular headache. their experimental study is to use ctth patients in supine position, using sublingual nitroglycerin and head lowering position respectively. induced headache, the healthy control group failed to induce obvious headache, while the headache intensity of ctth patients increased, and the two-dimensional doppler ultrasound (duplex ultrasound system) test the diameter and blood flow of the common arteries are found to increase the intensity of the headache and increase the diameter of the tube, that is, the diameter of the tube is increased, the intensity of the headache is increased, the diameter of the tube is reduced, and the intensity of the headache is also weakened, but the intensity of the headache and the blood flow in the blood vessel. the change has nothing to do with, so the author believes that the occurrence of headache in ctth patients is closely related to cranial hemodynamics. because the headache is slowed down after the end of the head low, it is thought that the headache is caused by insufficient intracranial venous return or venous dilatation. to. 4. some biochemical tth observed in recent years, some scholars from tth aspects of biochemical observations made as oishi et al. (1998) detected 4, 汕- thromboglobulin and 11-dehydro thromboxane b2 levels in plasma platelet factor, the content of the above three substances in patients with etth was significantly higher than that in the ctth group and the control group. it was considered that the headache and platelet dysfunction of etth patients were particularly close. mishima et al. (1997) found that the serum platelet magnesium level in patients with tth decreased, and it was considered possible and platelets. in terms of functional enhancement, martinez et al (1994) found that plasma levels of serotonin in patients with tth were higher than those in the control group, catecholamine levels were lower than in the control group, plasma dopamine levels were positively correlated with headache duration, and adrenaline levels were negatively correlated with headache intensity. in addition, monoamine levels were not associated with depression levels. these results suggest a change in central monoaminergic nervous system function in tth patients. this change is not associated with subsequent depression, but the pathophysiological mechanism of headache development. related, marukawa et al (1996) found that the levels of substance p and serotonin in saliva of patients with tth were significantly increased during the onset of headache, considered pthe substance is released by the pain system. in summary, the above examples show that the pathogenesis of tth is still being studied in many aspects, including the relationship between headache and muscle, the relationship between headache and depression, and even ※tension§ refers to muscle tension or the concept of psychology. there are different understandings.","['nervousness', 'look at things farther away', 'neck stiffness', 'children's headaches', 'face, head, neck, shoulders...', 'examination syndrome', 'child migraine', 'holding curse same head tight']",['insomnia'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['medical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

alcoholism,alcoholism is commonly referred to as drunkenness. alcohol (ethanol) drinking a large amount of alcoholic beverages at one time will have an excitatory and post-inhibitory effect on the central nervous system. severe poisoning can cause respiratory and heartbeat inhibition and death.,"1. carry out propaganda and education against alcoholism, create alternative conditions, and strengthen cultural and recreational activities. 2. do a good habit of ※drinking without getting drunk§ when drinking alcohol. do not use alcohol as a medicine to relieve irritability, loneliness, depression and work stress. 3, drinking should not disturb the law of eating, must not ""take wine as a meal"", so as not to cause malnutrition. 4, once addicted, should quickly stop drinking, the withdrawal syndrome should be carefully cared for, the severe must be admitted to hospital. anti-drinking drugs, such as alcohol and sulphur, can be used to stop drinking, which can cause disgust to wine. it can also be applied subcutaneously with apomorphine during drinking, causing aversive conditioning and abstinence. 5. after alcoholism and symptoms of alcoholic psychotic patients have improved significantly, they should help them solve interpersonal problems and enable them to achieve social rehabilitation.","alcohol is a neurotropic substance that has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system. after drinking, there is relaxation, warm feeling, elimination of tension, lack of relief and relief of discomfort or pain. a large amount of alcohol can cause drunkenness. it is a common acute alcoholism and long-term heavy drinking. can cause cerebral cortex, cerebellum, pons and corpus callosum degeneration, liver, heart, endocrine gland damage, malnutrition, enzyme and vitamin deficiency, etc., all kinds of alcohol can be dependent, but alcoholic beverages with high alcohol concentration are easier addiction, the dependence on alcohol is slower. generally, the formation of chronic alcoholism often has a long-term drinking history of more than 10 years. alcohol and sedative hypnotics may be cross-tolerant. some alcohol dependent people may be accompanied by hypnotic sedative dependence. pathophysiology 1. absorption, distribution, metabolism and ethanolexcretion ofethanol are completely absorbed in the stomach and small intestine within 30 min - 3 h, distributed in all aqueous tissues and body fluids in the body, including brain and alveolar gas. the concentration of ethanol in the blood can be directly reflecting the concentration of the whole body, ethanol is discharged from the kidney and lungs to the total of 10%, 90% in the liver metabolism, decomposition, ethanol is first oxidized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde is oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase for acetic acid, acetic acid is converted to acetyl-coa into the trihydroxy acid cycle, and finally metabolized to co2 and h2o. the metabolism of ethanol is a rate-limiting reaction, and the ethanol clearance rate is 2.2mmol/kg.h (100mg/kg.h). ethanol 7g (100% ethanol 9ml) can be removed in an hour. the rate of decline in blood alcohol concentration is about 0.43mmol/h (20mg/dl.h). although the degree of elevated blood alcohol concentration is affected by personal tolerance, there is no difference in lethal concentration of blood ethanol, generally 87-152mmol/l ( 400-700mg/dl). second, the poisoning mechanism (a) acute effects 1. central nervous system inhibition ethanol is ester-soluble, can quickly penetrate the nerve cell membrane in the brain, and acts on certain enzymes on the membrane to affect cell function. the inhibition of ethanol on the central nervous system increases with dose. from the brain mechanism down, through the limbic system, the cerebellum, the reticular structure to the cerebral ventricle, a small dose of excitatory action, due to the action of ethanol on the postsynaptic membrane benzodiazepine-r-aminobutyric acid receptor in the brain, thereby inhibiting the inhibitory effect of r-aminobutyric acid (gaba) on the brain, increasing the concentration of ethanol in the blood, acting on the cerebellum, causing ataxia, acting on the reticular structure, causing drowsiness and coma, and extremely high concentration of ethanol inhibiting the cerebral ventricle the center causes respiratory and circulatory failure. 2, metabolic abnormalities ethanol metabolism in the liver to produce a large number of nadh, so that the intracellular reduction and oxidation ratio (nadh / nad) increased, even up to 2-3 times normal, alcohol poisoning, depending on nadh / nad than normal metabolism can be abnormalities such as increased lactic acid, accumulation of ketone bodies leading to metabolic acidosis, and gluconeogenesis may cause hypoglycemia. (2) tolerance, dependence and blunt syndrome 1. tolerance, relaxed and excited euphoria after drinking, continue to drink, produce tolerance, reduce efficacy, need to increase the amount of alcohol to reach the original effect. 2. dependence in order to obtain the special pleasure after drinking, eager to drink alcohol, this is psychological dependence. physical dependence refers to repeated physiological drinking, which causes some physiological and biochemical changes in the central nervous system, so that alcohol needs to be continuously present in the body to avoid a special condition called withdrawal syndrome occurs. 3, withdrawal syndrome has been formed after long-term drinking, once stopped drinking or reduce the amount of drinking, there may be symptoms opposite to alcoholism, the mechanism is generally abstinence to alcohol inhibition of gaba significantly reduced, while plasma in the armor the concentration of adrenaline is elevated and sympathetic excitation symptoms appear. 3 the role of long-term alcohol abuse 1. nutritional lack of alcoholic beverages ethanol can supply 29.3kj (7kcal) of calories, but does not contain essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and amino acids. therefore, wine is a high-calorie and non-nutrient-flavored beverage. can cause obvious nutritional deficiencies, lack of vitamin b1 can cause wernicke-korsokoff syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, some people have the genetics of increased demand for vitamin b1, may also be the cause of the disease, folic acid deficiency can cause giant cell anemia, long-term when hunger and sugar supply are insufficient, fat decomposition predominates, and a considerable part of acetyl coa in the liver is synthesized into ketone bodies. 2. toxicity ethanol has a stimulating effect on mucosal and gland secretion, which can cause esophagitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, and ethanol to produce free radicals during metabolism in the body, which can cause cell membrane ester peroxidation and cause liver damage.","['breathing for wine', 'uncontrollable drinking impulse', 'alcohol addiction', 'consciousness', 'mental disorder', 'illusion', 'alcoholic toxic hallucinations', 'disgusting', ' vision distortion', 'blinking coma']",['coma'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

prevention are different, mainly in the following aspects: 1. improve the working environment. 2, avoid alcohol and quit smoking. 3, diet regulation: not only to prevent high-fat foods caused by elevated cholesterol, but also to take the necessary nutrients, such as protein, inorganic salts, amino acids and multivitamins, especially vitamins b1, b2 and b6, vitamin c and vitamins e is very important to the elderly. 4. keep your spirits happy for longevity and mental health. 5. arrange for life and study: when you are old, you must continue to learn new knowledge and maintain extensive contact with the society. 6. before retiring, be mentally and mentally well prepared, rich in life content, wide-ranging interests and hobbies, can promote mental activity, and delay or alleviate the process of aging. 7. regular physical examinations to treat physical illnesses early, pay attention to your body, and do not pay too much attention or worry. 8, regular outdoor activities: the elderly are suitable for more sustainable, more sports, such as walking, jogging, gymnastics, tai chi, tai chi sword and traditional dance. the treatment of ad mainly uses acetylcholinesterase (ache) and anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant and other symptomatic treatment drugs to temporarily relieve the cognitive decline of patients. health education japan association for the prevention of dementia recently invited experts in the study of dementia medicine to develop eight key points to prevent alzheimer's disease: first, a balanced diet, avoid excessive intake of salt and animal fat, one day salt intake should be controlled at 10 below gram, eat less animal fat and sugar, protein, dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, etc. should be balanced. second, moderate exercise, maintaining the strength of the waist and feet, the movement of the hand is also very important, often doing some complicated and exquisite handwork will promote the vitality of the brain, cooking, writing diaries, playing musical instruments, painting, etc. have prevention of dementia effect. third, avoid excessive drinking, smoking, regular life, excessive drinking can lead to liver dysfunction, causing abnormal brain function. people who drink more than 0.3 liters a day are more likely to have cerebrovascular dementia than ordinary people. smoking does not only cause cerebrovascular disease. dementia is also an important cause of dangerous diseases such as myocardial infarction. fourth, prevention of arteriosclerosis, hypertension and obesity and other lifestyle-related diseases, early detection, early treatment. fifth, be careful not to fall, head falls can lead to dementia, elderly people should use crutches when necessary, always maintain a high degree of interest and curiosity about things, can increase people's attention, prevent memory loss, the elderly should do more some things of interest and participation in public welfare activities, social activities, etc. to strengthen the brain nerves. sixth, we must actively use the brain to prevent mental decline. even when watching a tv series, you can express your feelings at any time to achieve the purpose of using your brain power. reading and publishing, playing chess, writing diaries, writing letters, etc. are simple. a method that helps the brain. seventh, pay attention to people at any time, maintain good interpersonal relationships, and find their own survival value. eighth, keep a young heart and dress yourself properly.","there are many kinds of dementia caused by brain degenerative diseases. the most common one is alzheimer's disease dementia. in the early stage of senile, it is called alzheimer's disease, and its onset is slow, which is progressive progressive dementia. there are also pico disease, tinton's chorea dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, parkinson's disease dementia, etc. these latter dementias are relatively rare. the most common form of multiple cerebral infarction dementia is caused by a series of multiple mild ischemic attacks, multiple accumulations caused by a substantial brain infarction, in addition to subcortical vascular dementia, acute episodes of cerebrovascular disease dementia can rapidly develop into dementia after a series of cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral embolism, and a small number can also be caused by a large area of cerebral infarction. in short, cerebrovascular disease is also a common cause of senile dementia. many studies at home and abroad have proved that the offspring of patients with alzheimer's disease have more chances to develop the disease, but its genetic pattern is still unclear. some people think it is dominant gene inheritance, while others think it is recessive gene inheritance. it is considered to be multi-gene autosomal recessive inheritance, and genetic effects can be restricted by environmental factors and mutations of genetic factors, so that its genetic effects are interrupted. some studies also suggest that elderly people are non-genetic diseases, such as vascular dementia and heredity. direct relationship. 1, endocrine disorders: such as hypothyroidism and parathyroid hypothyroidism may cause dementia. 2, nutrition and metabolic disorders: due to nutritional and metabolic disorders caused by brain tissue and its function damage caused by dementia, such as various organs caused by encephalopathy, such as renal encephalopathy, is chronic renal failure, uremia caused by the brain ischemia, hypoxia, can lead to dementia, other such as hepatic encephalopathy, pulmonary encephalopathy, etc. can lead to dementia, severe nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin b1, b12 and niacin, folic acid deficiency can lead to dementia, diabetes and high fat hypertension can cause atherosclerosis in large and middle arteries, thickening of small blood vessels and microvascular basement membrane, which can cause cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage, leading to vascular dementia. 3, tumor: malignant tumor caused by metabolic disorders can lead to dementia, brain tumors can also directly damage brain tissue leading to dementia. 4, drugs and other substances poisoning: alcoholism, chronic sprinkling poisoning caused by senile dementia is not uncommon, the middle is still not recognized by people, long-term exposure to aluminum, mercury, gold, silver, arsenic and lead, etc., poor protection, caused by chronic poisoning can lead to dementia, carbon monoxide poisoning is also one of the common causes of acute dementia. 5. aids: aids is one of the causes of alzheimer's disease. it is known that elderly people with progressive aids can develop progressive aids, and it has been shown that the central nervous system can directly infect human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). 6, syphilis: treponema pallidum can invade the brain, produce mental and neurological symptoms, and finally lead to paralysis and increasing mental retardation and personality changes, the so-called paralytic dementia. 7, other: brain trauma, epileptic seizures, and normal stress hydrocephalus and other causes can cause alzheimer's disease, in addition, the elderly long-term emotional depression, out of the group, widowed, illiterate, low language level, lack of physical and mental strength exercise, etc., can also speed up the process of brain aging and

reynolds syndrome,"raynaud's syndrome is a pathophysiological change characterized by cold or emotional factors that characterize the pale skin, cyanosis and flushing of both hands.this sign is caused by the paroxysmal sputum of the arteries. it is more common in young women, and it occurs in both hands and fingers, but it can also involve both feet and toes.there is no ""renault syndrome"" in chinese medicine, but there are similar records in the literature regarding its clinical manifestations.for example, in the han dynasty zhang zhongjing's ""treatise on febrile diseases"", there are ""hands and feet cold, pulse fine desires, angelica sini soup main. if there is a long-term person in the person, plus wu hao, ginger soup master.

manner.","a considerable number of patients with raynaud's syndrome live in the colder climate of northern europe, north america, britain, north china and other places. the typical incidence of raynaud's syndrome is often after the cold stimulation, the frequency and extent of the attack and the coldness of the climate. related. patients with raynaud's syndrome are mostly sympathetically excited, and some patients are also induced in the case of high mental stress. it may be due to the disordered state of the patient's vasomotor nerve center, which makes the peripheral arterial smooth muscle tension increase and sensitive to stimulation. increased in degree. renault syndrome is more common in women, and the symptoms of the patient are aggravated during menstruation and reduced during pregnancy, so consideration may be related to the level of secretion of sex hormones. among workers who have been engaged in vibration work (such as steam drills and chainsaws) for a long time, the incidence of raynaud's syndrome can be as high as 50%. studies have shown that when the vibration frequency is 125 hz, the impact tension on the distal finger artery is quite large. there is a manifestation of subendothelial fibrosis. in addition, among the employees in the frozen food industry, the incidence of raynaud's syndrome is also significantly increased. a significant proportion of patients with idiopathic raynaud's syndrome will show primary disease during follow-up (table 1). the ischemic changes in the distal extremities caused by these diseases are mainly arteriosclerosis or chronic arterial inflammation, local thrombosis. caused by peripheral arterial occlusion, rather than simple arterial spasm. pathogenesis the typical triad of raynaud's syndrome is pale fingers, cyanosis and flushing. the pale fingers are mainly caused by the slow perfusion of capillaries due to the strong spasm of small arteries, and thus the decrease or lack of blood flow in the skin vessels; hypoxia and accumulation of metabolites may cause the capillaries to include a small expansion of the venules, a small amount of blood flowing into the capillaries, and rapid deoxygenation to cause cyanosis; the vasospasm of the extremities is relieved, and a large amount of blood enters the dilated capillaries, ie, reactive hyperemia occurs. the skin color turns into flushing; when the blood flow is restored, the capillary perfusion is normal, the episode stops, and the skin color returns to normal. the pathogenesis of vasoconstriction during the onset of raynaud's syndrome has been studied for a century. renault believes that raynaud's syndrome is caused by abnormal neurological function, but this theory is denied by lewis. lewis repeatedly uses local anesthetics to block patients with raynaud's syndrome. autonomic and body wall nerves, but not effectively prevent the onset of raynaud's syndrome, he believes that the onset of raynaud's syndrome is due to local vascular function defects, caused by high blood vessel wall response under cold stimulation. when the contractile force of the artery is greater than the expansion force of the transarterial lumen, the blood flow in the artery is terminated. lewis's study shows that the blood flow of the finger artery is completely interrupted during the onset of raynaud's syndrome, and the pressure of the finger artery blood flow is interrupted by 0.667. about kpa (5mmhg), clinical observations show that there are two pathophysiological mechanisms of arterial occlusion and arterial spasm caused by the onset of raynaud's syndrome. patients with occlusive raynaud's syndrome due to proximal arterial occlusion, decreased intra-arterial dilatation force, normal vasoconstriction response caused by cold and emotional stimulation, can terminate the blood flow of the finger artery, the onset of raynaud's syndrome, many disorders can lead to arteriolar occlusion, the most common cause of which is arteritis associated with atherosclerosis and autoimmune connective tissue disease. normal arterial systolic sputum-finger arterial pressure changes between 1.33 and 2.00 kpa (10 to 15 mmhg). abdominal arterial pressure below 4.00 kpa (30 mm hg) or two-finger arterial pressure difference > 2.00 kpa (15 mm hg), suggesting significant arch or finger artery occlusion, plethysmographic studies indicate: arterial occlusive disease and arterial cold sensitivity there is a quantitative relationship, and patients with a significant decrease in pressure in the arterial lumen due to occlusion of the arch and finger artery are prone to raynaud's syndrome. the pathophysiological mechanism of raynaud's syndrome caused by arterial spasm is still not fully understood. patients with spastic raynaud's syndrome have no significant arch and finger artery occlusion. normal arterial pressure is normal at room temperature. arterial angiography studies show that under normal circumstances, renault synthesis the patient's finger artery has no obvious lesions, but under cold stimulation, the blood flow of the finger artery can be completely interrupted. krahnbahl et al studied the hemodynamics of the finger artery under cold stimulation in patients with spastic raynaud syndrome, when the temperature dropped. before 28 ～c, the patient's arterial pressure decreased little. when the temperature dropped to 28 ～c, sputum suddenly occurred and the arterial blood flow was interrupted. clinical and experimental studies have shown that the adrenergic nerve activity is enhanced in patients with spastic raynaud's syndrome. the arteriovenous shunt is significantly reduced when the normal finger is cold, and the blood flow of the capillaries is not significantly changed. the patients with spastic raynaud's syndrome at room temperature. under cold stimulation, arteriovenous shunt and capillary flow were significantly reduced. after sympathetic blockers, patients with spastic reynolds syndrome had significantly increased arteriovenous shunt and capillary flow at room temperature and cold stimulation. studies have shown that increased adrenergic nerve activity may be the main factor in the pathophysiology of spasticity renault syndrome. changes in 汐-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells may be associated with repeated cold stimuli, which may also be related to the pathophysiological mechanisms of patients with spastic raynaud's syndrome. keenan and porter's studies have shown that circulating platelets in patients with spastic raynaud's syndrome among them, the level of 汐2-adrenergic receptor is significantly higher than that of patients with occlusive raynaud syndrome and normal people. the serum of normal humans is incubated with the serum of patients with sputum raynaud syndrome. the level of 汐2-adrenergic receptors on normal human platelets is obvious. the decline, while the control group did not have this change, these studies show that the regulation of receptors is carried out by increasing the synthesis of cellular receptors, although receptors on the platelet membrane and receptor levels on vascular smooth muscle are still needed in humans. further quantitative studies, but experimental and clinical studies support the direct link between the two, and believe that changes in receptor levels are the most fundamental abnormalities in many factors leading to vasospasm. many other factors are also thought to be involved in the pathophysiological processes of spasticity of raynaud's syndrome, such as changes in blood viscosity, abnormal serum proteins, increased serum serotonin levels, and changes in vascular shear stress. it is believed that vascular action-related peptides, such as calcium-related peptides, endothelin, etc., are also involved in the onset of spasticity of raynaud's syndrome, but are not a major factor in most patients.","['skin partial skin...', 'hand skin is purple', 'the back of the hand is red and

accompanied by dizziness, lethargy, tinnitus, temper more paranoid wait.","first, with the growth of the elderly population, the prevention of senile deafness is an urgent need. if you want to enter the old age and still keep your ears clear, you must first have a healthy body and mind, create a good living environment, and go to a happy mood every day. in the face of everything, but also pay attention to diet, daily life, reduce fat foods, quit smoking and alcohol, proper physical exercise, try to avoid the use of ototoxic drugs, more interaction with others, more brains, more hands, this can delay aging arrival. 1, middle-aged and elderly people should adhere to physical exercise, such as walking, jogging, doing exercises, playing tai chi, etc., to enhance physical fitness, improve the body's blood circulation, slow down the process of aging. 2, reasonable arrangements for diet, middle-aged and elderly people do not consume too much fat and sweets, should eat more vegetables, fruits, beans and other light foods, to prevent high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, diabetes and other systemic diseases, and affect the ear the auditory function. 3, clinical application of streptomycin, neomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, polymyxin and other ototoxic drugs, should strictly control its indications, even if it is necessary to apply, it should be used with the least effective the dose should be treated with short-term treatment as much as possible. 4. once the middle-aged and elderly people find hearing loss, they should go to the hospital for examination, find out the cause, determine the nature of the disease, and treat it as soon as possible to prevent the aggravation of deafness. second, the experts suggest that if the following typical symptoms of senile deafness should be checked accordingly: 1. the bilateral symmetry hearing loss of unknown age is more than 60 years old, mainly due to the hearing loss of old age. 2, hearing loss is a slow progressive increase, often not noticed at the beginning, with the decline of high-frequency hearing, the ability to distinguish the language, at this time the patient has a audible sound, can not hear the content, it is often necessary for others to repeat. later, as the frequency of the language is impaired, the speaker is asked to raise his voice to talk to him. 3, there is often a phenomenon of auditory resilience, that is, the patient often said, ""when others whisper, they can't hear it, but when they are loud, they feel too noisy."" 4, the language resolution is not proportional to pure tone hearing, which is called ""phoneme decline"". in most cases, pure tone hearing loss is not as serious as language hearing. the older the age, the more obvious the phenomenon is that in many elderly people, although pure tone hearing is basically normal, still can't understand the content of the speech. 5. there is an age-related ""additional"" hearing loss among the elderly, which leads to a worse speech function than the younger ones at the same threshold level, and there is also a tendency to underestimate their own hearing loss. 6. in a noisy environment, the elderly have a poorer understanding of language. even if the elderly suffer little loss in hearing sensitivity, in a noisy reverberant environment, the difficulty of understanding speech is better than that of normal hearing. young people are much larger, and it is more difficult for older people with hearing impairment to understand speech. 7, some patients with senile sputum can be accompanied by tinnitus, often high-frequency sound, initially intermittent, appear in the dead of night, gradually change to persist, can be heard during the day, tinnitus often begins at 30-40 years old, its appearance the rate increases with age, reaching its peak at 60-70 years old, and then rapidly declines. most patients with tinnitus feel ""habit"" with tinnitus as they get older, and tinnitus can disappear automatically afterwards.","according to rosen, the hearing of remote tribes in the sudan is better than that of urban residents, especially those over 65 years old, who can maintain good high-frequency hearing. weston (1964) investigated the incidence of senile sputum in urban residents earlier than in rural areas. the reasons are manifold, but long-term noise damage is one of the main reasons. according to the hearings of the soviet union (1976) census moscow and georgia, the latter region eats more vegetarian food, the incidence of coronary heart disease is less, the elderly have better hearing, while the moscow residents are mainly meat, blood cholesterol is high. the incidence of cardiovascular disease is high, and the hearing of the elderly is also poor. rosen (1962) found that the average blood cholesterol of the elderly who ate a low-saturated fat diet was 5.2 mmol/l, while the blood cholesterol of a saturated fat diet increased by 6.76 mmol/ l, weston (1964) investigated 70% of senile deafness with atherosclerosis, and the severity of deafness was positively correlated with the degree of arteriosclerosis. lowell (1977) divided the patients with deafness into two groups according to age. there is a history of family deafness under 65 years old. it is a flat or basin-type hearing curve. there is no history of family deafness over 65 years old. it is a downhill type hearing curve and language recognition rate. low, genetics predominates, genetically, men and women are different, women's tissue tolerance is stronger than men's, and men are more likely to suffer from harsh environments and noise than women, smoking and drinking more than women, so older deafness is twice as many as female. senile deafness is the manifestation of human aging process in the auditory organs. the pathogenesis of senile deafness is complicated. it is still unclear. there are data showing that the incidence of senile deafness is significantly higher in elderly patients with hyperlipidemia. in the normal blood lipid group, hyperlipidemia promotes senile sputum, in addition to degeneration of outer hair cells and vascular streak due to lipid deposition, platelet aggregation and erythrocyte stasis, microcirculatory disorders, and may also interact with peroxidative lipids in biosensors and hairs in auditory receptors. the direct damage of the cells, the cochlear end of the weekend end of the spiral and related nerve atrophy, it is characterized by slow progress of bilateral, high frequency decline of the main sensorineural hearing loss, in addition, the elderly due to hyperosteogeny and deposition in order to narrow or occlude the inner ear canal and nearby bone pores and tubules, the corresponding nerve fibers, spiral ganglion atrophy, and nerve cells are reduced, which may be another cause of senile sputum. it should be acknowledged that senile sputum it is manifested in the aging phenomenon of hearing, which basically conforms to the metabolic law, and any treatment can not change this law and trend.","['deafness', 'drowsiness', 'abnormality of tone rhythm', 'hearing loss', 'terminous', 'dizziness']",[],"[' ent',

hemorrhage,"cerebral hemorrhage (cerebral hemorrhage), also known as cerebral hemorrhage, refers to spontaneous bleeding in non-traumatic brain parenchyma. the causes are diverse. most of them are caused by rupture of blood vessels caused by hypertension and small arteriosclerosis. therefore, it is also called hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.clinically, hemorrhage of the small arteries in the internal capsule area is the most common.hemorrhagic hematoma (or blood clot) can split, compress nearby brain tissue, destroy or affect their normal function (sports, sensation, memory, language, mental activity, etc.) and cause hemiplegia, partial numbness, unclear speech, etc. when the amount is large, it causes an increase in intracranial pressure, a shift in brain tissue, and even cerebral palsy.the disease is a common disease. the incidence rate of the elderly over 55 years old is high, and the male is higher than the female. the performance is rapid, rapid development, and early hemiplegia and disturbance of consciousness.sickness and mortality are high, and it is one of the major diseases that cause human death.","cerebral hemorrhage is also closely related to changes in the weather. when the weather becomes cold, the skin of the human body shrinks, causing a sharp increase in blood circulation in the heart and brain, an increase in cardiac load, an increase in cerebral circulation resistance, and an increase in blood pressure. therefore, winter is a high incidence of cerebrovascular accidents. elderly people with high blood pressure, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, etc., should be especially vigilant in winter to prevent the occurrence of cerebrovascular accidents. first, life should be regular. the elderly can do some work within their ability, but not too tired. second, to control high blood pressure in order to ideally control blood pressure must pay attention to many aspects. (1) blood pressure control at an ideal level: intervention experiments in a large population in china have shown that 140/80mmhg may be the ideal blood pressure value for prevention of cerebrovascular disease, but some people's blood pressure drops to this level and then there are symptoms of cerebral ischemia. the reason may be that the blood pressure is too fast, or the ideal blood pressure for these people is slightly higher than the above value, which is due to individual differences. it is more feasible to gradually lower the blood pressure over a period of time. it is advisable to go to the above level or slightly higher without the symptoms of cerebral ischemia. (2) the blood pressure should be controlled to be stable: the ""peak"" and ""valley"" of blood pressure within 24 hours are close to each other, so as to avoid damage to the blood vessel wall caused by blood pressure fluctuations, and prevent cerebral hypoperfusion caused by low blood pressure, and prevent blood pressure from falling. too fast. (3) maintain a comfortable mood: the occurrence of essential hypertension has obvious relationship with the environment and mental state. environmental factors include diet, social environment, life change, mental conflict, etc. high stress events can cause sympathetic nerves. guided vasoconstriction and other autonomic nervous responses have a large and lasting effect on blood pressure. brod observed that the vasoconstrictor response in hypertensive patients was longer than normal in patients with stress, and the general and special stress response was observed in patients with susceptibility. for acute and long-lasting blood pressure rise, psychophysiological studies suggest that mental stress, autonomic activity and conditional effects can cause high blood pressure. therefore, supportive psychotherapy for hypertensive patients is necessary. (4) simultaneous non-drug therapy: such as limiting salt intake, reducing body weight, lowering blood lipids, moderate exercise, and biofeedback therapy, can consolidate and promote the antihypertensive effect of drugs. third, maintain a good attitude to maintain optimism, avoid being too excited, to calm the mind, reduce troubles, sorrows and sorrows, indifferent to fame and fortune, contentment. fourth, pay attention to diet and diet should pay attention to low fat, low salt, low sugar, eat less animal brain, internal organs, eat more vegetables, fruits, soy products, with appropriate amount of lean meat, fish, eggs. fifth, prevention of constipation dry stool, defecation force, not only increased abdominal pressure, blood pressure and intracranial pressure also rise, it is easy to cause fragile small blood vessels rupture and cause cerebral hemorrhage, to prevent constipation, eat more fiber-rich food such as green vegetables, celery, leeks and fruits, appropriate exercise and abdomen self-healing massage before getting up in the morning, or with appropriate drugs such as maren pill, honey oral, kailulu, glycerin for external use; can effectively prevent constipation. sixth, to prevent physical exertion and mental work, do not be too tired, overload work can induce cerebral hemorrhage. seven, pay attention to weather changes cold weather is a good season of stroke, vasoconstriction, blood pressure is easy to rise, we must pay attention to keep warm, so that the body adapts to climate change, but also according to their own health, some suitable physical exercise, such as walking, broadcast gymnastics, etc. to promote blood circulation. eight, often left hand daily life, use the left upper limb and the left lower limb, especially the left hand, can reduce the burden of the left hemisphere of the brain, and can exercise the right hemisphere of the brain to strengthen the coordination function of the right hemisphere of the brain, medical research shows that cerebral hemorrhage is most likely to occur in the right hemisphere with weak blood vessels, so the best way to prevent the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage is to turn two fitness balls with your left hand in the morning and evening to help the development of the right hemisphere. nine, pay close attention to your body changes, strokes will have some aura symptoms, such as no headache, severe headache, dizziness, syncope, some sudden numbness, fatigue or temporary amblyopia, language communication difficulties, etc., should promptly seek medical treatment.","common microaneurysms or microangioma, cerebral arteriovenous malformation (avm), amyloid cerebrovascular disease, cystic hemangioma, intracranial venous thrombosis, meningeal arteriovenous malformation, specific arteritis, fungal arteritis, smog disease and arterial anatomy and so on. there are hypertension and migraine, blood factors such as anticoagulation, antiplatelet or thrombolytic therapy, haemophilus infection, leukemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia and so on. intracranial tumors, alcoholism and sympathetic nerve stimulating drugs. the cause is unknown such as idiopathic cerebral hemorrhage. in addition, some factors have a certain relationship with the occurrence of cerebrovascular disease, may be the cause of cerebrovascular disease: 1 blood pressure fluctuations: such as high blood pressure patients have not taken antihypertensive drugs recently, or angry, etc., causing blood pressure to increase, to contract the increase in pressure is especially important. 2 temper or emotional stress: common in angry, after quarreling with people. 3 bad habits: such as smoking, alcohol, excessive salt, overweight. 4 excessive fatigue: such as physical and mental labor, defecation, exercise. second, the pathogenesis 1, themechanismof cerebral hemorrhage in the mechanism of occurrence, in fact, each case of cerebral hemorrhage is not caused by a single factor, but may be caused by several comprehensive factors, there are many mechanisms for the formation of cerebral hemorrhage in hypertension, compare it is recognized that the theory of microaneurysm is generally considered to be insufficient blood pressure to cause cerebral hemorrhage. cerebral hemorrhage often occurs on the basis of combined cerebrovascular disease. (1) rupture of microaneurysm: due to the long-term tension caused by hypertension in the small arterial wall of the brain, an aneurysm is formed in the weak part of the blood vessel wall, and its diameter is generally 500 米m. many arterioles are formed in the intracerebral penetrating artery of hypertensive patients. tumors, which are mostly distributed in the striate arteries of the basal ganglia, pons, cerebral white matter and cerebellum with an artery diameter of 100-300 米m. this aneurysm forms a sac in the weak part of the blood vessel wall. when the blood pressure suddenly rises, this cystic blood vessels are easily broken and cause cerebral hemorrhage. (2) fat glass-like change or fiber necrosis: long-term hypertension has a damaging effect on the inner membrane of the arterial wall of the brain parenchyma with a diameter of 100-300 米m. the lipid in the plasma enters the intima through the damaged endometrium. wall thickening and plasma cell infiltration, the formation of fat glassy changes, and finally lead to tube wall necrosis, easy to rupture when blood pressure or blood flow changes drastically. (3) cerebral atherosclerosis: the arterial intima of most hypertensive patients have multiple lesions at the same time, including local fat and complex carbohydrate accumulation, hemorrhage or thrombosis, fibrous tissue growth and calcium deposition, and cerebral atherosclerosis in the case of cerebral infarction, the artery in the ischemic softening zone of the large brain is easily ruptured and hemorrhagic necrotic lesions are formed. (4) the outer membrane and middle layer of the cerebral artery are structurally weak: the middle cerebral artery is at right angles to the deep perforating-bean vein artery that occurs. this anatomical structure causes sudden increase in blood pressure due to factors such as exertion and agitation. the blood vessel is prone to rupture and bleeding. 2, pathophysiological mechanism of cerebral hemorrhage (1) major pathophysiological changes: rupture of blood vessels to form hematoma, the surrounding tissue appeared cavernous degeneration after 30 minutes of hematoma formation; after 6h, adjacent brain parenchyma, changed from time to time necrotic layer, hemorrhage layer, sponge-like degeneration and edema. in addition to mechanical stress, these changes in brain tissue surrounding the hematoma are mainly plasma, and blood cell components such as hemoglobin and other vasoactive substances play an important role. after hemorrhage, the internal volume of the skull increases, which destroys the stability of the intracranial environment. the resulting cerebral edema leads to further increase of intracranial pressure, and also affects regional cerebral blood flow and coagulation and fibrinolysis system function. in addition to the space-occupying damage of the hematoma itself, there are blood circulation disorders in the surrounding brain tissue, metabolic disorders (such as acidosis), vasomotor paralysis, damage to the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and release of various biologically active substances by blood breakdown products. damage to brain tissue. 1 macromolecular substances: albumin in plasma, cleavage of cell membrane components and macromolecular substances released intracellularly may participate in the formation of cerebral edema. 2 vasoactive substances in hematoma: the vasoactive substances in the hematoma can diffuse into the brain tissue, causing vasospasm, vasodilation or vascular permeability changes. 3 some vasoactive substances other than hematoma: such as histamine, serotonin, kinin, bradykinin, arachidonic acid and its metabolites, can aggravate brain tissue damage. 4 free radicals: red blood cell extravasation destruction, hemoglobin decomposition releases iron ions and heme, can induce the production of a large number of free radicals, aggravating brain damage. 5 active enzyme release: the nerve cells contain a large amount of lysosomes, and various hydrolases are released into the cytoplasm, causing further damage or necrosis of the nerve cells. 6 endothelin release: endothelin produced by vascular endothelial cell injury can cause intracellular calcium overload, resulting in vasoconstriction and aggravation of cerebral ischemia. 7 excitatory neurotoxic amino acids: increased excitatory amino acids in the damaged area can promote nerve cell necrosis. 8 participation of various immune responses: various chemokines promote the transfer of neutrophils to the lesions, and produce active substances, enzymes and free radicals, which cause direct and serious damage to the local brain tissue. (2) cerebral edema formation: edema is most serious around the hemorrhage, ipsilateral cerebral cortex, contralateral cortex and basal ganglia also have edema, cerebral edema around the hematoma is both angiogenic and cytotoxic, away from the brain edema of the lesion is as a result of the proliferation of vasogenic cerebral edema, experiments showed that autologous blood injection into the caudate nucleus of mice showed that the edema of the ipsilateral basal ganglia reached a peak within 24 hours, and remained constant until the fifth day began to resolve. (3) the effect of cerebral hemorrhage on coagulation, anticoagulation, and fibrinolysis status: it is generally believed that tissue thromboplastin is released after acute brain tissue injury, which increases blood coagulation activity, reduces antithrombin consumption, and fibrinolysis. the activity compensatory increase, the study of the coagulation process found that within the first 24 hours after bleeding, the release of thrombin during the formation of clots can cause adjacent brain edema, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier disruption and cytotoxicity. in addition, red blood cell lysis, which peaks about 3 days after the initial bleeding, is another mechanism of brain edema formation, which may be related to the release of free hemoglobin and its degradation products. recent studies have shown that free radicals, excitatory amino acids and membranes are calcium. permeability is an important factor in ischemic brain injury. oxygen free radicals may be derived from arachidonic acid release, catecholamine metabolism, leukocyte activation, nitric oxide synthesis and other pathophysiological processes, and the release of ferric iron. oxides and hydrogen peroxide are converted to more toxic hydroxyl radicals, a more important neurotransmitter of ischemic cerebral edema, which produces superoxide anions, which are probably associated with blood breakdown products, including three the price is related to iron. in summary, although the pathophysiological mechanism of cerebral hemorrhage is very complicated, understanding and mastering the pathological process of brain damage during cerebral hemorrhage will contribute to drug therapy and promote the absorption of hematoma and the recovery of nerve function, and at the same time, the cerebral hemorrhage the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms needs further study. 3, the main pathological changes of cerebral hemorrhage (1) bleeding site: about 70% of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage occurs in the basal ganglia; brain lobe, brain stem and cerebellar dentate nucleus each accounted for about 10%. small intramedullary canal aneurysms are often seen in the deep perforating artery. hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage is common in the middle cerebral artery. the deep medullary artery (42%), the basilar artery pons (16%), the posterior cerebral artery (15%), the cerebellar nucleus and deep white matter of the superior cerebellar artery branch (12%), the apical occipital lobe and the white matter branch of the temporal lobe (10%), etc., the nucleus hemorrhage often invades the internal capsule and breaks into the lateral ventricle. the blood is filled with ventricular system and subarachnoid space; thalamic hemorrhage often breaks into the third ventricle or lateral ventricle, and damages the internal capsule; cerebral bridge or cerebellar hemorrhage directly breaks into the subarachnoid space or the fourth ventricle, non-hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage mostly located under the cortex, common in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, arteriovenous malformation, moyamoya disease. (2) pathological examination: swelling of the hemisphere on the hemorrhage, congestion, blood flow into the subarachnoid space or breaking into the ventricle; the hemorrhagic foci form an irregular cavity, the center is filled with blood or purple grape-like blood clots, surrounded by necrotic brain tissue, bloody softening zone and obvious inflammatory cell infiltration, brain tissue around the hematoma is compressed, edema is obvious, large hematoma can cause brain tissue and ventricle displacement, deformation and cerebral palsy, supratentorial hemorrhage, hematoma down squeeze the lower part of the hypothalamus and the brainstem to displace, deform and subsequently send out blood. the cerebellum is often present, and the midline structure such as the hypothalamus and the supratentorial brain stem are moved down to form a central iliac crest, such as a high intracranial pressure or a sublingual brain. large hemorrhage of the stem and cerebellum can occur in the occipital foramen magnum; cerebral palsy is the most common cause of direct death of cerebral hemorrhage after the acute phase, the blood clots are dissolved, the phagocytic cells clear the hemosiderin and necrotic brain tissue, the gliosis is proliferated, the small hemorrhagic foci form a glial scar, and the large hemorrhagic foci form a stroke sac.","['coma', 'high blood pressure', 'recurrent nosebleeds', 'pivot numbness', 'partial loss of speech function', 'brain death', 'sensory disorder']",['hypertension'],"['surgery', 'neurosurgery']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'symptomatic treatment']"
cerebrovascular,"cerebral thrombosis is the most common type of cerebral infarction.is cerebral artery trunk or cortical atherosclerosis caused by vascular thickening, stenosis and thrombosis, causing local blood flow reduction or interruption of blood supply, brain tissue ischemia and hypoxia leading to softening and necrosis of focal neurological symptoms .","1, living and living 1 diet adjustment according to a variety of varieties, moderate and balanced diet principles, arrange food for three meals a day, eat more food to prevent stroke, according to reports, milk, fish, soybeans, soybean meal, peanuts, garlic , onions, strawberries, etc. are beneficial for preventing blood clots. 2 drinking water sufficient daily normal drinking water should reach 2000~2500 ml. for the elderly, it is necessary to drink more water. the elderly have different characteristics of thick, sticky, poly, and coagulated blood. drinking more water is beneficial to reduce blood viscosity, reducing cerebral thrombosis has the characteristics of thick, sticky, poly, and condensed. drinking more water is beneficial to reduce viscosity and reduce the risk of cerebral blood test. 3 quit smoking and drinkingalcoholto stop smoking and alcohol, limit salt intake, it is best not to exceed 5 grams per day, while diet should not be fatty. 4 work and rest should be moderate with the brain, do not last too long, those who are under 60 years old use the brain for one hour, should rest for about 10 minutes, those over 60 years old use the brain for half an hour, should rest for 5 to 10 minutes, so as not to be too tired induced stroke. 5 the law of life thelife of theelderly should be regular, because the elderly's physiological regulation and adaptive function decline, life is irregular, easy to cause metabolic disorders, and promote thrombosis. 6 after eating rice, after the meal, the blood gathers in the gastrointestinal tract to help the blood supply of the digestive organs, while the blood supply to the brain is relatively reduced. at the same time, after eating, the patient will sleep, and the blood pressure will drop, which will further reduce the blood supply to the brain. the flow is slow and it is easy to form a blood clot. therefore, it is best to sleep for half an hour after a meal. 7 body position changes to slow cerebral thrombosis often occurs at night, especially at the toilet, because the blood flow at night is slow, and the position change when getting up, it is easy to cause insufficient blood supply to the heart and brain, so it must be awake after the toilet at night, slow get up, in fact, usually do housework should also pay attention to body position changes not too fast, so as not to cause brain ischemia. 8 pay attention to weather changes the weather adaptability of the elderly is weakened. overheating and overheating can increase the viscosity of the blood and induce stroke. therefore, it is necessary to take corresponding preventive measures when the temperature changes suddenly and suddenly. 9 control weight through exercise to consume excess body fat to reduce blood lipids reduce the risk of stroke. 10 caution with drugs for long-term use of hypnotics, sedatives, antipsychotics, hemostatic drugs, diuretics, (heating drugs such as compound aminopyrine), (anti-asthma drugs such as aminophylline), can increase the chance of stroke. 2, emotional mood to maintain stability, often maintain optimism, open-minded, happy mood, avoid ecstasy, anger, worry, grief, because of long-term mental stress, mood swings, easy to make neurological fluid regulation disorders, causing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular circulation a disorder causes a stroke. 3, qigong therapy in the elderly there is a risk factor for cerebral thrombosis, before the stroke, you can take qigong prevention, mainly the following several methods for reference: lifting tempering, stroke guidance, guiding static sitting , jiannao gong, shujin huoxue.","the most common diseases are atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, which can accelerate the development of cerebral atherosclerosis. the most common sites of cerebral thrombosis are the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, lower basilar artery, and vertebra. upper arterial segment, vertebral-basal artery junction, middle cerebral artery trunk, posterior cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery, etc. other causes include non-specific arteritis, leptospirosis, aneurysm, collagen disease, polycythemia vera, and head and neck department of trauma and so on.","[' urinary dysfunction', 'syncope when swallowing', 'high blood pressure', 'light sputum', 'biasedness', 'sensory disorder', 'toe numbness', 'body dystonia']",['hemiplegia'],"['surgery', 'neurosurgery']","['rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'drug treatment']"

cerebrostomy,"cerebral arteriosclerosis refers to chronic encephalopathy such as neurasthenic syndrome, arteriosclerotic dementia, and pseudobulbar paralysis caused by multiple infarction, softening, necrosis and atrophy of the brain after cerebral arteriosclerosis.cerebral arteriosclerosis can cause acute cerebral dysfunction and chronic cerebral ischemia in tcia, stroke, symptoms and signs are different from tcia, stroke and vascular dementia. there is a history of tcia or mild stroke but no obvious sequelae. it is more appropriate to diagnose cerebral arteriosclerosis.therefore, the diagnosis of cerebral arteriosclerosis is still necessary for preservation, which is helpful for reminding patients and doctors to prevent stroke early.","control risk factors include: 1. increase the awareness rate of hypertension, treatment rate and control rate, effectively monitor, choose 汕-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists and diuretics. blood pressure. 2, to maintain blood cholesterol levels below the critical level of 5.20 ~ 6.24mmol / l, adjust the diet, appropriate selection of various lipid-lowering drugs such as statins. 3, regular monitoring of blood glucose, patients with hypertriglyceridemia should effectively control diabetes. 4, develop a healthy lifestyle, stop smoking and limit alcohol, increase outdoor sports, reduce weight, balance diet, maintain psychological balance. try to do the following : 1. physical exercise: before exercise, you should clearly define the purpose of physical exercise and participate in a happy mood. you should master the principle of gradual and perseverance. exercise comprehensively, strictly control the amount of exercise, avoid eating and drinking in large quantities. strong tea, exercise within two hours after coffee, and should not eat or drink a thick drink within half an hour after exercise. 2, cultivate a healthy lifestyle, pay attention to diet control, reasonable diet, atherosclerosis patients, avoid eating the following food: sheep marrow, fat meat, pig liver, pig kidney, duck eggs, goose meat, clams, liquor, beer, etc., prevention several foods for arteriosclerosis: ginger, milk, soybeans, garlic, onions, sea fish, tangerines, hawthorn, tea, eggplant, oatmeal, soft-shelled turtle, fungus, sweet potato. 3, nursing, arteriosclerosis caused by headache care should pay attention to the following points: health education, for those with mental retardation, mental disorders and physical mobility, to strengthen care to prevent accidents. 4, massage, acupuncture treatment of cerebral arteriosclerosis. the disease is mainly based on diet control and physical exercise, supplemented by drug treatment, and the effect is better.","cerebral atherosclerosis mainly invades the large and middle brains with a diameter of more than 500米m. the main cerebral artery lesions around the willi's ring in the east are severely related and are closely related to hypertension. in the past, small arteries mainly assumed and regulated vascular resistance, which was high. blood pressure mainly causes small arteriosclerosis. recently, it has been found that the main brain of the brain accounts for 20% to 30% of the total cerebral vascular resistance, and 50% of chronic hypertension. long-term high blood pressure will inevitably lead to atherosclerotic damage to the main arterial wall of the brain. (b) the pathogenesis of hypertensive cerebral arteriosclerosis mainly occurs in the brain parenchyma diameter <200米m small perforating artery, blood flow side pressure continues to exceed the maximum contractile force of the medial smooth muscle, vascular smooth muscle degeneration and necrosis, loss of contractility, passive expansion of blood vessels, impaired endometrium, increased permeability, infiltration of plasma components, leading to cellulite necrosis of small arteries, causing hypertensive encephalopathy is an acute decompensation, persistent chronic hypertension, blood flow side pressure and various vasoactive substances under the small arterial wall, structural compensation, smooth muscle hypertrophy, hyalinization, increased connective tissue components such as collagen, protein and glycans, thickened wall, called hypertensive arteriosclerosis, vascular wall tolerant hypertension increased ability, but the regulation of blood flow is reduced, and when the blood pressure is lowered, it can cause lacunar infarction. due to long-term hypertension, micro-aneurysm can be formed in the vitreous of arterioles and arterioles. when the blood pressure suddenly increases, the aneurysm rupture is the main cause of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. long-term cerebral arteriosclerosis can cause cortex. white matter softening focal ischemia, ct or mri findings leukoariosis, if significant symptoms of dementia, binswanger called cortical encephalopathy (binswanger subcortical encephalopathy) below. under the action of long-term hypertension, the muscular arterial smooth muscle also undergoes the process of compensatory arterial smooth muscle from functional compensation to structural compensation. the wall is hardened, thickened and the lumen narrowed. in order to maintain the original blood flow, the flow rate can be accelerated. lead to vascular endothelial cell injury, endothelial cells are the key mediator of hemodynamic effects, endothelial damage causes vasomotor function, initiates hemostasis coagulation process, blood lipoprotein infiltration, intimal thickening, atherosclerotic plaque formation the vascular lumen is further narrowed. under hemodynamics, atherosclerotic plaque ruptures, ulcers and hemorrhage, induce thrombosis, cause arterial occlusion and cerebral infarction. it can be seen that long-term hypertension is the most cerebral atherosclerosis. an important cause. hyperlipidemia is closely related to cerebral atherosclerosis. it has been proved that serum cholesterol (tc) > 3.9mmol / l (150mg / dl) can occur atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia is an important promotion of cerebral atherosclerosis factors, carotid atherosclerotic plaque degeneration, ulcers, fractures and hemorrhage can often induce thrombosis, so that the narrow arterial blood flow is significantly reduced, can suddenly occlusion, leading to thrombotic cerebral infarction, detached small embolism blocked in the distal small arteries, it can cause sudden and unpredictable tcia or thromboembolic stroke. pathological changes of atherosclerosis include: 1 the fatty streak is an early lesion, which occurs mostly at the opposite side of the blood flow bifurcation. it is a local adaptive thickening of the intima to the mechanical force, and contains a large amount of lipids derived from macrophages or smooth muscle cells. quality foam cells. 2 fibrous plaques consist of lipid-containing smooth muscle cells and connective tissue rich in collagen fibers, covering the intimal layer and protruding into the lumen of the blood vessels. the arteries may expand to accommodate the enlargement of the plaque. 3 the composite lesion is formed by hemorrhage, necrosis, ulceration, calcification and wall thrombus in atherosclerotic plaque. as the plaque increases, the part is softened by intermediate ischemia, and the surface of the plaque breaks under the force of blood flow. with plaque internal bleeding or thrombosis. 4 ulcers are shallow depressions or penetrating plaques on the plaque, which contain deep ulcers of hemorrhage, lipids and calcification. 5 plaque hemorrhage may be due to plaque fracture or intimal rupture, blood into the softened plaque, or into the plaque of the nourishing small blood vessels rupture (related to hypertension), there are often acute and fresh inflammatory reactions around plaque hemorrhage, it can be seen that polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages infiltrate, and plaque bleeding plays an important role in triggering stroke. 6 complex plaque contains a large number of lipids, and its content is closely related to the degree of arterial stenosis and cerebral ischemia. the higher the collagen content as the main component of smooth fiber plaque, the lower the risk of ischemia.","['insufficient heart and blood supply', 'tiredness', 'with hypertension', 'memory disorder', 'elderly leg cramps', 'cerebral ischemia', 'brain dysfunction', 'blinking

brain abscess,"brain abscess refers to a disease in which a purulent infection invades the brain and forms a purulent lesion in the brain parenchyma, including purulent encephalitis, chronic granuloma and brain abscess capsule formation.pathogenic bacteria are mostly bacteria, including fungi, parasites and the like.the clinical manifestations of brain abscess may vary depending on the time, size, location, and pathological development stage of abscess formation.brain abscesses can occur at any age and are most common in children and young adults.","the incidence and mortality of brain abscess is still high. before the application of antibiotics, the mortality rate is as high as 60-80%. in the 40s and 70s, the mortality rate was reduced to 25-40% due to the application of antibiotics and diagnosis and treatment. after ct application, the mortality rate is not significant, still 15 to 30%, which is difficult to find in the early stage of this disease (especially blood-borne). when the patient comes to the clinic, the abscess is advanced, and the general operative mortality is related to the preoperative patient consciousness. the awake person is 10-20%, and the coma is 60-80%. various therapies have sequelae of varying degrees, such as hemiplegia, epilepsy, visual field defect, aphasia, mental consciousness change, hydrocephalus, etc. therefore, brain abscess the treatment should be more important than treatment, and pay attention to early diagnosis and treatment, such as focusing on the cure of otitis media, lung infection and other primary lesions, in order to prevent problems before they occur.","middle ear inflammation, mastoiditis, sinusitis, skull osteomyelitis and intracranial sinusitis and other purulent infections can spread directly into the brain, forming a brain abscess, which is most common in chronic otitis media, mastoid inflammation caused by brain abscess. it is called otogenic brain abscess, accounting for about 50% to 66% of all brain abscesses. however, due to many otitis media in recent years, mastoiditis has been cured in time, the proportion of otogenic brain abscess has been significantly reduced, otogenic most of the brain abscesses are chronic otitis media. the acute exacerbation of mastoiditis and cholesteatoma leads to brain abscess. the infection path is mostly through the tympanic cap or sinus sinus and the middle and posterior part of the intracranial temporal lobe, accounting for about 2% of otogenic brain abscess. 5, the other part of the subdural side of the dura mater plate and the outer part of the cerebellum, especially the child's mastoid bone is thin, infected with the trautman triangle (ie below the sinus, above the facial nerve canal, in front of the sigmoid sinus, formed by the three triangle) involving the cerebellum, but the pediatric tympanic cavity and mastoid are not well developed, so pediatric otogenic brain abscess is rare, cerebellar abscess accounts for about 1/3 of otogenic brain abscess, otogenic brain abscess can also be retrogradely transferred to the vein distant part, such as the amount, top, occipital lobe, and even occasionally transferred to the contralateral brain, otogenic brain abscess is mostly single, common pathogenic bacteria are mainly proteus and anaerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria are mostly streptococcus, followed by bacilli, can also be a mixed infection. brain abscess caused by sinusitis is called nasal brain abscess. it is rare, and it occurs mostly in the bottom of the frontal lobe. it is mostly single, occasionally multiple or multiple atrial, mostly mixed bacteria infection, scalp spasm, intracranial sinusitis and brain abscess caused by skull osteomyelitis occur in the vicinity of the primary lesion, brain abscess and epidural, subdural or mixed abscess, mostly mixed infection, may also be fungal infection. brain abscess caused by bacterial endocarditis, congenital heart disease, especially cyanotic heart disease, called cardiogenic brain abscess, congenital heart disease in infants and young children, often with polycythemia and hemagglutination hyperfunction, because the sick child has arteriovenous blood communication, the peripheral venous blood can be directly transmitted into the brain to form an abscess if there is a purulent bacterial infection. the abscess that is spread by the artery is often located in the white matter or white matter and cortex of the middle cerebral artery. at the junction, it is good for the forehead, top, and temporal lobe; while the infection on the face occurs in the frontal lobe, and the pathogenic bacteria are mainly hemolytic staphylococcus aureus. trauma or surgical debridement is not thorough, not timely, there are foreign bodies or broken bone fragments remaining in the brain, can form abscess within a few weeks, a few can form abscesses in the months or years or even decades after the injury, generally 3 the abscess caused within a month is called early abscess, more than 3 months is called advanced abscess, and the abscess is mostly located at or near the trauma site. the pathogens are mostly staphylococcus aureus or mixed bacteria. in recent years, reports of brain abscess caused by immune dysfunction have been increasing, and there are still some unexplained brain abscesses. pathogenesis after the bacteria enter the brain parenchyma, the pathological process is roughly divided into three stages, but there is a continuous change process between the three, there is no obvious boundary in each stage, the development process is due to the source, the species and the individual. the difference in the situation is different. 1. acute encephalitis (1 to 3 days after infection) refers to the infiltration of early pathogenic bacteria into the brain parenchyma for 24 hours, localized inflammatory cell infiltration, necrosis in the center of the lesion, and inflammatory cell exudation around the lesion. focal brain tissue destruction, followed by liquefaction, can form multiple liquefaction foci, edema around the white matter of the lesion, inflammatory reaction can also occur in the nearby meninges, but the site does not necessarily correspond to the lesion site, this stage clinically except for focal symptoms, systemic inflammation in addition to the reaction, there may be symptoms of meningeal irritation, and inflammatory changes in the cerebrospinal fluid may occur. 2, the inflammatory lesions in the parenchyma of the parenchyma further necrosis, liquefaction, fusion to form a pus, gradually enlarge the formation of the abscess, according to the extent of the lesion can form a single or multiple rooms or multiple abscesses, at this stage there are glial cells around the abscess proliferative or inflammatory granulation tissue formation, the surrounding brain tissue may have edema reaction, but the abscess wall has not yet fully formed. as the inflammation begins to limit, the symptoms of systemic infection tend to improve, but the focal occupancy effect also tends to be obvious. 3, abscess envelope formation period in this stage, the inflammation is further localized, that is, the capsule around the abscess is formed. the inner layer of the capsule is mainly pus cells and degenerated white blood cells, the middle layer is the granulation tissue of fibrous tissue hyperplasia, and the outer layer is glial cells and glial fibers. for the thin layer of the capsule, a clear abscess capsule is formed gradually. the abscess is mostly single, but it can also be multiple rooms. multiple abscesses scattered in different parts are rare. the speed of capsule formation depends on various factors, such as pathogenesis. the type of bacteria, toxicity, response to antibiotics and the strength of the individual's body, the location of the abscess, such as otogenic brain abscess, the pathogenic bacteria are mostly proteus, staphylococcus aureus, easy to form a capsule, forming time it is also short. if the pathogenic bacteria are anaerobic bacteria, the formation of the capsule is difficult. in addition, if the lesion is in the vicinity of the ventricles or brainstem, the disease develops rapidly and the performance is also heavier, that is, the capsule has not formed well and the condition is critical. . once the abscess is formed, it is a space-occupying lesion. there is cerebral edema around the abscess. the mass effect causes the intracranial pressure to increase and the brain tissue to shift. with the development of the disease, if it is not treated in time, the cerebellar incision or the occipital foramen can be caused.hernia, oppression of the brain stem and further increase of intracranial pressure, leading to a sharp deterioration of the disease, and even death, and because of the increasing pus, the pressure of the abscess cavity, can lead to ulceration of the abscess, the spread of pus, causing purulent meningitis or suppurative ventriculitis, resulting in increased disease, increased treatment difficulty, brain abscess can also be combined with localized meningeal response, showing serous meningitis, arachnoiditis, individual brain abscess can be combined with subdural abscess and / or dura mater external abscess and so on.","['newborn's eyes on the gaze', 'yan tie', 'neonatal

cerebral infarction,"cerebral infarction (cerebral infarction, ischemic stroke) refers to ischemic necrosis or brain softening of localized brain tissue caused by blood supply disorders, ischemia, and hypoxia. the common clinical type of cerebral infarction is cerebral thrombosis. formation, lacunar infarction and cerebral embolism, etc., cerebral infarction accounted for 80% of all strokes.several diseases associated with it are: diabetes, obesity, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, arrhythmia, dehydration of various causes, various arteritis, shock, excessive blood pressure drop and so on.","daily prevention of cerebral infarction controls weight. obesity is a risk factor for cerebral infarction and should be controlled by controlling diet (especially high-energy foods) and physical exercise. dietary nutrition should be balanced, eat more vegetables, fruits and cereals, reduce the intake of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, salt intake is controlled below 6 grams per day. insist on exercise can reduce the risk of recurrence by 20%, and perform at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day, such as walking, jogging, tai chi, cycling, etc., 5-7 times a week. in addition, adjust your mentality, treat yourself and others correctly, and try to maintain a positive, open-minded, relaxed mood. for those who have a tendency to depression, antidepressant medication should be added. health education 1. for patients with hypertension, blood pressure should be controlled at a reasonable level. because the blood pressure is too high, it is easy to cause microvascular aneurysm and atherosclerotic small artery rupture and hemorrhage in the brain; and low blood pressure, incomplete blood supply to the brain, and microcirculation stasis, it is easy to form cerebral infarction. therefore, it should prevent various factors that cause sudden decrease in blood pressure, slow cerebral blood flow, increased blood viscosity, and increased blood coagulation. 2. active treatment of transient ischemic attacks. 3. pay attention to mental health, many episodes of cerebral infarction are related to emotional excitement. 4. pay attention to changing bad habits, and moderate physical activity is good for health. avoid bad habits such as smoking, alcoholism, binge drinking, and overeating. it should be based on low-fat, low-calorie, low-salt diets, and have high-quality protein, vitamins, cellulose and trace elements. foods that are not conducive to health, mildew, salted fish, and cold foods do not meet the requirements of food hygiene and should be fasted. 5. when the temperature changes suddenly and the pressure and temperature change significantly, most of the elderly, especially the frail and sick, are sick and sick, especially in the cold and summer, the elderly have poor adaptability, reduced immunity, morbidity and death. the rates are higher than usual, so be careful. 6. pay attention to the signs of cerebrovascular disease in a timely manner, such as sudden on one side of the face or upper and lower limbs suddenly feel numb, weak and weak, mouth sputum, drooling; suddenly feel dizzy, shaking; short-term confusion or lethargy.","60% to 75%, common diseases due to chronic atrial fibrillation, the main source of embolus is rheumatic valvular disease, endocarditis and thrombosis, and myocardial infarction, atrial myxoma, heart surgery, heart catheter, mitral valve prolapse and calcification, congenital atrioventricular septal defect (venous abnormal embolus). such as atherosclerotic plaque detachment, pulmonary vein thrombosis or clot, fat plug and air embolism during fracture or surgery, blood clot or thrombus detachment during endovascular treatment, carotid fiber dysplasia (more common in women), lung infection , sepsis, hypercoagulable state of nephrotic syndrome, etc. can cause cerebral embolism. about 30% of brain embolism.","['brain-occupying lesions', 'co-disorder', 'vascular occlusion', 'hair sputum', 'clothing jade', 'brain stem infarction', 'increased intracranial pressure', 'sensory disorder']",['cerebral infarction'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
cerebral palsy syndrome,"a term used to describe a series of motor disorders characterized by impaired voluntary motion is due to prenatal dysplasia or perinatal or postpartum central nervous system damage that occurs before the age of five.cerebral palsy (cp) is not a diagnostic term but is used to identify children with non-progressive paralysis, ataxia, or unconscious movements.about 0.1% to 0.2% of children have cp syndrome; more than 1% of premature newborns or those with small gestational age are affected.","prevention of cerebral palsy is a cross-sectoral, multi-disciplinary project, from eugenics and superior education, maternal and child health care, perinatal care, obstetrics clinical and nursing to neonatal care, nursing, multiple links and joint implementation, cerebral palsy the prevention of concurrent disorders and secondary disorders is more multi-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary participation, and can be completed by adding active rehabilitation therapy. according to the principle of ※prevention first§ in modern medicine, the concept of ※three-level prevention§, cerebral palsy prevention should be divided into the following aspects. 1. primary prevention primary prevention is the most important prevention stage of cerebral palsy. the main purpose is to prevent the occurrence of cerebral palsy, that is, to prevent the occurrence of various high-risk factors leading to cerebral palsy, especially the health care of pregnant women during perinatal period. (1) do a good job of delivery during pregnancy. from the time of mother's pregnancy to the time of childbirth, the fetus depends on maternal survival. the health and nutritional status of pregnant women are closely related to the growth and development of the fetus. the adverse factors affecting maternal health can directly harm the fetus. the first 3-4 months of pregnancy is a critical period for the differentiation of various organs of the fetus, especially the formation and differentiation of nerve organs. during this period, if the mother suffers from viral infection, poisoning, x-ray, trauma, smoking or alcohol abuse. etc., can affect the development of the fetal central nervous system, resulting in cerebral palsy or other deformities. in addition, certain conditions during childbirth, such as dystocia, fetal asphyxia, etc. may also cause cerebral palsy, therefore, do a good job of pregnancy care, to ensure that pregnant women good health, prevent disease, reasonable nutrition, control the number of pregnancies, do not smoke, do not drink alcohol, do prenatal checkups for pregnant women, eliminate dystocia factors, and ensure that delivery is an important and effective measure to prevent cerebral palsy. (2) to do neonatal care first in hospital delivery, in order to carry out fetal monitoring, resuscitation or surgical delivery, if necessary, in order to avoid fetal brain damage during the production process, the baby born within one month of leaving the mother to live in the natural environment, its various aspects of growth and development are very fast, but the ability to adapt to the environment is relatively poor, extremely susceptible to infection and lead to cerebral palsy, if you can do a good job in the health care of newborns, use a set of scientific newborn screening measures, that is grasping the health care work in the three stages of prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum can prevent a considerable number of children with cerebral palsy, deformed children and children with mental retardation. in short, as long as the conditions permit, the babies born must go to a nearby health center for regular physical examinations. (3) necessary immunization the necessary planned immunization for pregnant women, such as the injection of rubella vaccine, can prevent the infection of pregnant women with rubella virus, thereby preventing the resulting cerebral palsy. 2. secondary prevention for children who have already caused cerebral palsy, positive preventive measures should be taken to prevent various disability, early detection and early rehabilitation, so that the dysfunction of children with cerebral palsy is significantly reduced. as soon as possible, early treatment, the baby should go to the hospital for regular check-up immediately after birth, especially if the mother is not going well during pregnancy, or have dystocia, premature birth, neonatal asphyxia, etc. should be closely observed, once the child is found to be abnormal you should go to the hospital for a comprehensive examination immediately. if you can make a correct early diagnosis of the cerebral palsy, and make reasonable treatment and comprehensive rehabilitation measures as soon as possible, it is possible that some children with cerebral palsy will basically recover normally. so, how can we find children with cerebral palsy early for the average parent, it is mainly based on the early manifestations of cerebral palsy in children, that is: 1 development is behind normal children, careful parents can find children with cerebral palsy all aspects of development are behind the normal age of the same age, the whole body is soft, weak or tight limbs, playing very easy to start, less moving or excessively turbulent, eating milk is weak, often licking, licking, spitting milk, crying weak or array screaming; 2-3 months will not laugh, will not look up, continue to cry, finger grip will not open; 4-5 months will not turn over; 8 months will not sit, even will not grasp, hold, can not put your hand to the mouth, in addition, intellectual development is also behind the normal children of the same age, 2 with abnormal movements or postures, such as: drooling, limbs involuntarily twitching and shaking; the toes are on the ground and the heels are not hanging or the two lower limbs are crossed; the movements of the limbs are uncoordinated and asymmetrical; the head is turned to one side and cannot be kept in the middle position. in addition, according to the different postures and performances of children with cerebral palsy and normal children, they can be found early and go to the hospital as soon as possible to obtain the best rehabilitation effect. 3. third-level prevention when cerebral palsy obstacles appear obviously, all possible measures should be taken early to prevent them from developing into disability, and the preservation of existing functions to provide education and vocational rehabilitation opportunities to reduce disability to individuals, families and society. negative effect.on the basis of prevention of primary cerebral palsy, it should also be actively prevented for various secondary disorders, because secondary disorders will further aggravate the dysfunction of children and bring new pain to children. the difficulty of rehabilitation, because the motor dysfunction and posture abnormality of children with cerebral palsy have not been corrected in time or the severity of the disease is severe, there will be a series of secondary disorders, such as contracture of the joints of the limbs, deformity, muscle atrophy, shoulders, dislocation of the hip, lordosis, kyphosis, scoliosis, decalcification of the bone, fractures, etc., can also cause a series of physical and mental development disorders, such as decreased cardiopulmonary function, orthostatic hypotension, thrombotic veins tube inflammation, depression, psychological disorders, etc., the above secondary obstacles should be early prevention and treatment, early intervention and rehabilitation, and actively take preventive measures, the specific measures are the use of various rehabilitation treatments, including education rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation, social rehabilitation, etc. comprehensive rehabilitation content, due to the late start of rehabilitation in china, the prevention and treatment of cerebral palsy has not yet formed a system, and due to economic conditions, it cannot be established in the short term.many treatment and education center, the community-based rehabilitation and home guidance and training for china's national conditions, have more vitality.","the cause is often difficult to determine, but premature delivery, intrauterine abnormalities, neonatal jaundice, birth injury, perinatal asphyxia play an important role, nearly 15% of cases may be caused by birth injury and perinatal asphyxia, especially in premature infants paraplegia, perinatal asphyxia, limb tonic spasm, perinatal asphyxia or jaundice after hand and foot or low muscle tone, early childhood central nervous system trauma or severe systemic diseases (eg meningitis, sepsis, dehydration) ) may also cause cp syndrome.","['upper skin numbness', 'powerless', 'tiredness', 'irritability', 'twitching', 'cough', 'sputum reflex', 'slow response', 'weight gain']","['epilepsy', 'children's speech and language barriers', 'children's learning ability disorder', 'consciousness disorder', 'intelligent disorder']","['pediatrics', 'pediatric synthesis']","['supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
dermatomyositis,"dermatomyositis (dm), also known as poikilodermatomyositis, is one of the autoimmune connective tissue diseases. it is a non-suppurative inflammation mainly involving striated muscle and lymphocyte infiltration. lesions, with or without multiple skin lesions, can also be associated with various visceral lesions.polymyositis (pm) refers to the disease in this group without skin damage.","1. try to avoid direct sunlight (mainly ultraviolet rays), wear hats, gloves, long-sleeved clothes or umbrellas when going out. 2, no cosmetics, hair dyes. 3. avoid contact with pesticides and certain decorative materials. 4. women of childbearing age should try their best to avoid pregnancy and abortion when their condition is not very stable. fertility should be under the guidance of a physician.","the exact cause is not clear enough. it may be a viral infection, an abnormal recognition of the body's immune abnormalities and vascular lesions. the three may also be related to each other. for example, lentivirus infection of striated muscle fibers may cause changes in muscle fiber antigenicity, which is mistaken by the immune system. it is considered to be ""existing"", which causes vasculitis to occur. 1. immunological research in view of the increase in serum immunoglobulin, muscle biopsy specimens showed igg, igm and c3 in the tiny blood vessels and c56-c9 deposition in the complement membrane attack complex. the degree of deposition seems to be related to disease activity, arahata and engel. it was confirmed that there was a significant increase in b cells in inflammatory lesions of dm, suggesting an increase in local humoral effects, but some scholars believe that the deposition of these antibodies is a consequence of muscle damage rather than its cause, and some scholars have found blood lymphocytes around patients. after the addition of striated muscle antigen, the conversion rate and macrophage migration inhibition test were high, and it was positively correlated with its activity. after glucocorticoid reduction, the peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients were cytotoxic to myoblasts in vitro. the role of its damage may be the release of lymphotoxin or direct adhesion and invasion of muscle fibers. 2, sensory theory in recent years, some scholars have observed the muscle and skin lesions of patients with electron microscopy, found that muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, perivascular tissue cells and fibroblasts and nuclear membranes have similar mucinous or paramyxoviruses. the granules, recently reported that coxackie a9 virus was isolated from the diseased muscles of 11-year-old girls, so the infection theory was proposed. however, in animal experiments, it has not been able to inject muscles of patients, plasma and cause muscle inflammation from patients. antiviral antibodies cannot be detected in the blood. in children with dermatomyositis, there is often a history of upper respiratory tract infection before the onset, anti-streptococci ""o"" value increased, antibiotics combined with corticosteroid treatment can be effective, proposed infection allergy theory. 3. vascular lesions vascular lesions have been described especially in children with dm. any diffuse vascular disease can produce striated muscle ischemia, which causes necrosis of individual fibers and infarct areas of muscles. there are capillaries in dm/pm special children. evidence of endothelial cell damage and thrombosis of blood vessels, and the deposition of immune complexes in intramuscular blood vessels, as well as thickening of the capillary basement membrane, especially in the perisome region of the muscle bundle.","['scales', 'papill', 'pigmentation spot', 'photoallergy', 'pigmentation loss', 'anti-jo-1 antibody positive', 'itching']",['interstitial pneumonia'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
migraine,"migraine is a type of periodic episode with family morbidity. it is characterized by paroxysmal hemiplegic headache with nausea, vomiting, and shame. after a period of rest, it occurs again in a quiet, dark environment or after sleep. the headache is relieved.it can be accompanied by nerves and mental dysfunction before or during a headache.","because many factors can induce migraine, pay attention to care in daily life, avoid these factors on the body's invasion, careful living, conditioning diet, emotional and so on can prevent migraine attacks to a certain extent. migraine life conditioning 1, pay attention to the impact of climate, wind, dry, damp heat, storm, bright and dazzling sunshine, cold, thunder and other climate changes can induce migraine attacks, pay attention to shelter from the cold, keep warm, do not expose to the rain, prevent the induction of disease. 2, pay attention to the impact of sleep, exercise or overwork, pay attention to regular sleep, exercise, strengthen work planning, organization, pay attention to work and rest, pay attention to eye regulation, protection is an important preventive measure for sensitive patients. 3, pay attention to indoor ventilation, quit smoking and alcohol. 4, pay attention to the effects of drugs, can induce migraine drugs such as contraceptives, nitroglycerin, histamine, reserpine, hydrazine, estrogen, excess vita and so on.","oral contraceptives can increase the frequency of migraine attacks. menstruation is a common trigger or aggravating factor for migraine (""cyclical headache""). pregnancy, sexual intercourse can trigger a migraine attack (""sexual headache""). some susceptible individuals may experience typical migraine attacks after taking nifedipine (xintongding), isosorbide (xinxin) or nitroglycerin. especially the weather is getting hot, cloudy or wet. the most common are alcoholic beverages, such as certain red wines. dairy products, cheese, especially hard cheese, coffee, nitrite-containing foods such as soups, hot dogs. some fruits, such as citrus fruits, chocolate (""chocolate headache""). some vegetables, yeast, artificial sweets, fermented pickled products: such as kimchi, msg. minor movements of the head can induce or exacerbate migraine attacks, and some patients are afraid to ride because of fear of migraine attacks. people who play football can cause headaches by head-to-head (""sportsman migraine""). migraine can occur when climbing stairs upstairs. 1. too much or too little sleep. 2, a meal missed or delayed. 3. smoking or being in the smoke. 4, flash, the light is too strong. 5, nervous, angry, depressed, crying (""cry headache""), many women go shopping or to a crowded occasions can cause migraine attacks. migrants can be exacerbated when someone is riding abroad, although they are less than 1 minute. among the stimulating factors, quantity, joint action and individual differences should be considered. for sensitive individuals, eating an orange may not cause headaches, while eating a few oranges may cause headaches. in some cases, eating a few oranges does not cause headache attacks, but if there is also the influence of menstruation, this combination can cause migraine attacks. some individuals will have seizures in the mall for a while, while some individuals will only have migraine attacks after waiting in the mall for a long time. there are still many improvement factors in migraine. some people can lie in a moment of migraine attack, which can relieve headaches. some people close their eyes in a dimly lit room to relieve headaches. some people like to press their eyes with both hands when they have a headache. in order to relieve headaches, some people can relieve headaches by washing their heads with cold water. migraine tends to be relieved after menopause and 3 months after pregnancy.","['headache', 'high blood pressure', 'headache after strenuous exercise', 'night headache', 'face pale', 'neural pain', 'consciousness disorder', 'dizziness', 'dizziness', 'head dizzy bulging limbs weakness]","['nausea and vomiting', 'headache', 'dizziness', 'ataxia', 'terminous', 'consciousness', 'arrhythmia']","['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
parkinson's disease,"parkinson's disease, also known as idiopathic parkinson's disease (pd), referred to as parkinson disease, also known as paralysis agitation (paralysisagitans, shakingpalsy), is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly, is also the most middle-aged and elderly common extrapyramidal diseases, the main lesions in the substantia nigra and striatum pathway, and decreased dopamine production.the exact cause of this pathological change is still unclear. genetic factors, environmental factors, aging, and oxidative stress may be involved in the degenerative death of pd dopaminergic neurons.the prevalence rate of people over 65 years old is 1000/100,000. with age, men are slightly more than women. in 1817, the british doctor james parkinson first described the disease in detail. the clinical manifestations mainly include static tremor, bradykinesia, myotonia and posture gait disorder, and patients may be accompanied by non-motor symptoms such as depression, constipation and sleep disorders. .therefore, it is called parkinson's disease, and the diagnosis of the disease mainly depends on medical history, clinical symptoms and signs.there is no abnormal change in the general auxiliary inspection.although the current treatments can only improve the symptoms, can not prevent the progress of the disease, and can not cure the disease, but effective treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of patients.the life expectancy of pd patients was not significantly different from that of the general population.","primary prevention (no disease prevention and disease prevention) 1. for those with family history of parkinson's disease and related gene carriers, those who are exposed to toxic chemicals should be regarded as high-risk groups. close follow-up visits, regular physical examinations, and health education should be strengthened. pay attention to self-protection. 2. increase the environmental protection of industrial and agricultural production, reduce the emission of harmful gases, sewage and dirt, and strengthen labor protection for hazardous workers. 3. improve drinking water facilities in rural areas and towns, protect water resources, reduce pollution of river water, reservoir water, pond water and well water, and ensure that the broad masses of the people can drink safe and healthy drinking water. 4, the elderly with caution phenothiazines, reserpine and butyrylbenzene drugs. 5, pay attention to the prevention and treatment of senile diseases (hypertension, hyperlipemia, hyperglycemia, cerebral arteriosclerosis, etc.), enhance physical fitness, delay aging, prevent atherosclerosis, and play a positive role in the prevention of parkinson's disease. secondary prevention (early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment) 1. early diagnosis, long subclinical period of parkinson's disease, if early preclinical diagnosis techniques such as olfactory dysfunction, pet scan, mitochondrial dna, dopamine antibody , cerebrospinal fluid chemistry, electrophysiological examination, early detection of subclinical parkinson's disease, using neuroprotective agents (such as vitamin e, sod, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, neurotrophic factor, seli treatment in jilin may delay the entire clinical phase. 2. in the early stage of parkinson's disease, although the nigral and striatum nerve cells decreased, the dopamine secretion increased compensatoryly. at this time, the dopamine content in the brain was not significantly reduced, which was called compensation period, and generally did not advocate drug treatment. physiotherapy, medical sports, tai chi, spa, massage, qigong, acupuncture and other treatments can be used to maintain daily general work and life, and to delay the application of anti-shock palsy drugs, but some people advocate early application of low-dose levodopa. reduce complications, which are treated with drugs for different people. third-level prevention (delaying the development of the disease, preventing sickness and improving the quality of life) 1. actively carry out non-drugs such as physical therapy, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage, etc. and comprehensive treatment of chinese and western medicines or surgery to delay the development of the disease. 2, pay attention to psychological counseling and spiritual care, to ensure adequate sleep, to avoid emotional stress, to reduce the predisposing factors of increased muscle tremor. 3. actively encourage patients to take active actions, such as eating, dressing, washing, etc. those with language problems can work hard to practice pronunciation in the mirror, strengthen joints, muscle activity and labor training, and maintain limb movement function as much as possible. prevent wrestling and limb malformation. 4, long-term bedridden, should strengthen life care, pay attention to cleanliness, diligently turn over the back, prevent complications such as hypostatic pneumonia and acne infection, parkinson's disease mostly died in the lungs or other systems such as urinary system infections pay attention to diet and nutrition, if necessary, give nasal feeding, keep the urine and urine smooth, to continuously enhance physical fitness, improve immune function and reduce mortality.","in the long-term practice, medical scientists have found that parkinson's disease seems to have a tendency to family aggregation. the family members of patients with parkinson's disease have a higher incidence than their normal counterparts. the etiology of idiopathic parkinson's disease has not been known so far. some central nervous system degenerative diseases with parkinson's disease symptoms are mainly characterized by degeneration of different parts of the central nervous system. there are other clinical features, so it can be called symptomatic. parkinson's disease, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (psp), striatum substantia nigra (snd), shy-drager syndrome (sds) and oligopontocerebellar atrophy (opca), and some diseases or factors can be produced similar to the clinical symptoms of pd, the disease is caused by infection, drugs (dopamine receptor blockers, etc.), poisons (mptp, carbon monoxide, manganese, etc.), vascular (multiple cerebral infarction) and brain trauma, etc. parkinson's syndrome (palkinsonism). parkinson mainly occurs in middle-aged and elderly people. it is rare before 40 years old, suggesting that aging is related to the disease. the study found that after 30 years old, dopaminergic neurons, tyrosine oxidase and dopa decarboxylase activity, striate the level of dopaminergic transmitters gradually decreases with age. however, only a small number of elderly patients suffer from this disease, indicating that physiological dopaminergic neurons are not enough to cause disease, and age aging is only a trigger for the onset of this disease. epidemiological investigations have found that there are regional differences in the prevalence of parkinson's disease, so people suspect that there may be some toxic substances in the environment that damage the brain's neurons. genetic susceptibility. al汐53thr mutation in a common nuclear gene has been found in patients with familial parkinson's disease in recent years, but has not been confirmed many times in the future. it is generally believed that parkinson's is not a single factor, and multiple factors may be involved. genetic factors may increase the susceptibility to disease, only through interaction with environmental factors and aging, through oxidative stress, mitochondrial failure, and calcium overload. excitatory amino acid toxicity, apoptosis, immune abnormalities and other mechanisms lead to the loss of a large number of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. pathological change the main lesion of pd is degeneration of pigment-containing neurons, and the da neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta are most prominent. under the microscope, the nerve cells are reduced, the melanocytes of the substantia nigra disappear, and the melanin particles are scattered in tissues and macrophages, with different degree of gliosis, normal human nigral cells decrease with age, black matter cells from the original 425,000 to 200,000 at the age of 80, less than 100,000 pd patients, da neurons can be lost when symptoms appear more than 50%, blue spot, middle nucleus, vagus nerve dorsal nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus can also be slightly altered. 1. the appearance of eosinophilic inclusion body in the cytoplasm of residual neurons is the important pathological feature of this disease. lewy body is a glass-like mass composed of cytoplasmic proteins with a dense core in the center and filaments around it. halo, a cell can sometimes be seen in a number of different sizes of lewy bodies, seen in about 10% of residual cells, substantia nigra, globus, striatum and blue spots are also visible, alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin it is an important component of lewy's body. 2. neurochemical changes: da and acetylcholine (ach) act as two important neurotransmitters in the striatum, and their functions are mutually antagonistic. maintaining the balance between the two plays an important role in regulating the activity of the basal ganglia. the da transmitter pathway in the brain is mainly the substantia nigra-striate system, the da-derived neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta can take l-tyrosine from the bloodstream and form levodopa (l-dopa) under the action of intracellular tyrosine hydroxylase (th). dopamine decarboxylase (ddc) acts to form dopamine (da), which passes through the substantia nigra-striatum bundle, da acts on the putamen, caudate nucleus synaptic neurons, and finally decomposes into high vanillic acid (hva). 3, due to the reduction of th and ddc in idiopathic parkinson's disease, the da production is reduced (l-dopa is reduced by l-tyrosine, da production is reduced), and monoamine oxidase b (mao-b) inhibitor can reduce da decomposition in neurons. metabolism, increased da content in the brain, catechol-oxygen-methyltransferase (comt) inhibitors can reduce the peripheral metabolism of l-dopa and maintain the stable plasma concentration of l-dopa. 4, pd patients with substantia nigra da neuron degeneration, degeneration of the nigrostriatal striatum da pathway, striatum da content decreased significantly (> 80%), making the ach system function relatively hyperactive, leading to increased muscle tone, action in order to reduce the biochemical basis of other motor symptoms, the da content in the midbrain-marginal system and the midbrain-cortex system has also been significantly reduced in recent years, which may lead to high-grade neurological activity disorder such as mental decline, behavioral emotional abnormalities, and speech disorder, and the degree of da transmitter reduction. the patient's symptom severity is consistent, the early rate of the disease is increased by da (pre-synaptic compensation) and the da receptor is hyper-sensitive (post-synaptic compensation), the clinical symptoms are not obvious (compensatory period), with the disease progressive typical pd symptoms (decompensation), basal ganglia other transmitters or neuropeptides such as norepinephrine (ne), serotonin (5-ht), substance p (sp), enkephalin (enk) ), somatostatin (ss) also changed.","['depression', 'functional tremor', 'blood

2. advocate regular living and working, adequate sleep, reasonable diet structure, quit bad hobbies; actively participate in interesting cultural and sports activities; 3. actively treat the primary disease; 4, the correct role of drug prevention. second, for ordinary tension headaches, the best way is to avoid the nervous situation and any behavior that may lead to tension, which is easier said than done, but it is difficult to do it. sometimes it is difficult to recognize a nervous situation; it is also difficult to avoid. if it is necessary to submit a report to the supervisor, be assigned to do typing for three consecutive hours, and the children at home are not obedient, etc., in some occasions, try to take some precautions. don't stay in the same position for a long time, for example, avoid sitting on the desk for a long time, standing up and stretching your limbs, moving your muscles, talking to others about things that are not related to the current troubles or difficulties, relaxing, lying down and taking a break. or wash a warm water bath to relax yourself. if this self-help therapy has no effect, you may want to seek medical advice. consider other non-drug therapies that prevent headaches, such as biofeedback, relaxation therapy and other muscles that make the head and vascular relaxation therapy. summer headache prevention and care headache is a common symptom of many diseases. there are three main types: neurological headache, infectious disease headache, and intracranial extracranial disease headache. among them, the first two types of headaches originate from the proportion of physical weakness or wind evil invasion. most of them have a certain relationship with weather conditions. clinical practice and modern medical research have shown that high temperatures, suffocating, thunderstorms, strong winds, and sudden changes in the weather often cause or aggravate headaches in summer, and summer diet and sleep often lead to headaches. according to the specific impact of climate on headaches, common headaches in summer can be divided into three categories: first, summer headache, this is a typical seasonal headache, it will occur in the summer, after the fall, the cure will be cured, the summer climate is hot, especially in the early summer when the temperature rises suddenly and the temperature exceeds 37 ～c. people with a history of summer are generally difficult to adapt, so the autonomic nerve function begins to disorder, loss of appetite, lack of sleep, fatigue of the whole body, headache often accompanied by low fever, the main cause of summer headache is weakness, lack of blood, should according to the summer treatment, in the summer to improve diet, eat more fruits and vegetables, while doing a good indoor cooling, to ensure a certain amount of sleep. second, cold drink headache, summer weather is hot like steamer, ice watermelon, ice beer, ice cream and other cold food and beverage products have become people's ""pets"", but when imported cold drinks, it will give a strong stimulation to the oral mucosa, which may make the nerves of the ankle skin produce radioactive pain that is not obvious to some people, but may cause acute exacerbations in some patients with a history of headaches (such as migraine), which often become tight after eating cold drinks. closed, headache is unbearable, and even tinnitus or mild nausea may occur. therefore, people with a history of headaches must eat less or not drink cold drinks. when a headache occurs, if it is not very serious, you can repeat partial massage with your hands to relieve pain, if the headache is particularly severe, you should seek medical advice promptly. third, low-cranial headache, summer temperature is often higher than human body temperature, so sweat evaporation is the main way of heat dissipation, when the sweat evaporates too much, the human body is easy to dehydrate; in addition, because of the climate, summer food is easy to deteriorate, people eat the spoiled food is prone to acute gastroenteritis or bacterial dysentery, which causes vomiting and diarrhea, causing dehydration. after dehydration, when the body is dehydrated, when the body changes, especially when standing, there will be headache symptoms, and bed rest should occur when a headache occurs, but no pillows are needed to keep the head low. in order to eliminate and reduce dehydration, a certain amount of physiological saline can be input.","(1) infected meningitis, meningoencephalitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, etc. (2) vascular lesions: subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral embolism, hypertensive encephalopathy, insufficient blood supply to the brain, cerebral vascular malformation, thromboangiitis obliterans.

nickel carbonyl poisoning,"nickel carbonyl is a liquid metal compound formed by reacting nickel metal with a carbonyl group (-co) under a certain pressure. nickelcar-bony ipoisoning is a systemic disease mainly caused by respiratory and nervous system damage.industrial nickel carbonyl is used to refine high-purity nickel powder, organic synthesis, rubber, petroleum catalyst, nickel spray, etc., and acute poisoning can occur after a large amount of inhalation by workers. nickel carbonyl poisoning is a disease in which high concentrations of nickel carbonyl are induced to cause respiratory damage.the patient first developed symptoms such as headache, dizziness, gait instability, chest tightness, and nausea. after 12 to 36 hours, toxic edema may occur.nitrogen exposure can be increased by exposure to nickel carbonyl for 24 hours.whether nickel carbonyl can cause chronic poisoning is still controversial.acute carbonyl nickel poisoning in addition to dissociation, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate can be used to drive nickel and symptomatic therapy. the early symptoms of acute nickel carbonyl poisoning are easily confused with upper respiratory tract infections, which may lead to misdiagnosis and delay in treatment.chronic poisoning has no specific symptoms, and a definitive diagnosis can be made in combination with on-site investigation and comprehensive analysis of clinical data.urine nickel determination can help to estimate the degree of acute carbonyl nickel poisoning. mild poisoning of urine nickel does not exceed 0.325米mol/l (25米g/l), moderate poisoning 0.325F8.5米mol/l (25F500米g/l), severe poisoning more than 8.5 米mol/l (500 米g/l).","professional guidance production workshop, strict implementation of rules and regulations and mechanical operation procedures, strengthen ventilation and personal protection.reasonably design the area of the inlet and outlet; in the natural ventilation design of the plant, the area of the inlet and outlet must be reasonably coordinated, and the area of the inlet should not be smaller or larger than the area of the outlet. this should be extremely important for improving the natural ventilation effect. and effective technical measures.the natural ventilation design of the factory building must not be based on the established building layout, and the ventilation opening calculation is used to determine the opening area of the sunroof.","nickel carbonyl vapor can be quickly inhaled through the respiratory tract, and the skin is also absorbed in a small amount. after entering the body, about 1/3 of the original form is exhaled by the lung within 6 hours, and the rest is gradually decomposed into nickel ions (ni0Lni2+) and carbon monoxide in the cells. ni2+ binds to intracellular nucleic acids, proteins, and gradually transfers to plasma and is excreted in the urine. carbonyl nickel inhibits thiol-containing enzymes in pulmonary capillary endothelial cells, causing increased capillary wall permeability, causing pulmonary interstitial edema and alveolar exudation. nickel carbonyl affects rna polymerase, interferes with rna synthesis, and acute carbonyl nickel poisoning there is still congestion and necrosis in the central area of the hepatic lobules; vasodilation of the cerebral cortex, hemorrhage, especially in the white matter.","['insomnia', 'coma', 'irritablety', 'chest tightness', 'dizziness', 'arrhythmia', 'low', 'be out of breath', 'pink bubble sputum']",['insomnia'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
positional vertigo,"positional vertigo (positionalvertigo), also known as ampullary apex otolith, is more common in adults aged 40 to 60 years, more common in women.it can be a trigger for the sensitivity of gravity stimulation, which is induced by a certain head position and lasts for less than 30 seconds.the general incubation period is 2 to 3 seconds, and the duration is rarely more than 1 minute. there is very little nausea, vomiting, cold sweating, and less dumping.there are no tinnitus and deafness in the onset of vertigo, and the existing cochlear symptoms are not aggravated.the condition is relieved within weeks or months, and individuals can stay for several years.","the etiology of this disease is complex and not fully understood. without special precautions, the disease can resolve within weeks to months, but may recur after months or years. in the diet, it is advisable to eat light and damp products such as melon, corn, millet, lotus leaf porridge, radish, beans and soy products, black fungus, eggplant, pea sprouts, tomatoes, lettuce, orange, grapefruit, peach, soybean oil, tea, squid, sea bream, etc.among them, special emphasis is placed on eating more kumquats, oranges and radishes.kumquat can regulate qi, relieve phlegm and phlegm.","due to the spontaneous degeneration of the elliptical sac, the otolith is detached from the cystic plaque and deposited on the posterior ampulla.gammaglobulinemia, globulin deposition on the ampulla of the ampulla, or the alcohol of the alcoholic drinker makes the ampulla of the ampulla thinner, can produce intrinsic, when the children with severe deafness wear high-intensity (120 ~ 130db) hearing aids, about half positional vertigo occurs. infection can induce this disease, for example, in the process of viral labyrinthitis or chronic suppurative otitis media, white blood cells, phagocytic cells or endothelial fibrin enter the lymphatic fluid; brain trauma or sacral surgery, blood into the lymphatic fluid, can be formed tangible particles, deposited in the ampulla of the ampulla, barber reported that the humeral longitudinal fracture, 47% of patients may have positional vertigo, 20% of those without fractures, dix and hallpike (1952) report 100 in patients with otitis media, 26% had location vertigo, ear surgery such as tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy and other vestibular lesions, but also the disease. lindsay, cawthorne found that the anterior vestibular artery and the superior vestibular nerve branch of the elliptical sac and the upper semicircular canal and the external semicircular canal degeneration, while the balloon and the posterior semicircular canal are normal, it is considered that hypertension, heart disease and vertebral artery insufficiency, causes anterior vestibular artery embolism, which causes the otolith membrane to degenerate, fall off, and deposit on the ampulla.","['stationic doctor', 'dizziness', 'airsickness', 'out of cold sweat', 'rotating vertigo', 'disgusting', 'severe dizziness, unstable standing', 'postal vertigo']",['disgusting and vomiting'],"[' ent', 'otolaryngology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
pediatric tuberculous meningitis,"tuberculous meningitis is caused by tuberculosis invading the meninges and inflammation caused by brain parenchyma. it is the most serious type of tuberculosis. it is more common in children under 5 years of age. the main source of infection is from adults with open tuberculosis. the respiratory tract is predominant, often occurring within 6 months to 1 year after initial infection with tuberculosis.early symptoms are not typical, can be expressed as poor appetite, gradual weight loss, sweating after sleep, long-term irregular low fever, diagnosis and treatment is not timely, the condition gradually worsened to high fever convulsions, coma, and even death.if the disease is not treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs, the mortality rate is 100%. since the universal vaccination of bcg and the application of anti-tuberculosis drugs, the incidence and mortality of tuberculous meningitis have decreased significantly.however, the diagnosis is not timely and the treatment is not correct, and the mortality and sequelae are still high.therefore, active prevention, early diagnosis, and early treatment are the key to reducing morbidity and mortality.","mainly seen in children aged 1 to 5 years old, with more incidence in spring and winter, measles and whooping cough are often the cause of brain disease, head trauma, surgery and overwork can be occasional incentives. the most basic way to prevent brain infection is to prevent children from being infected with tuberculosis. the effective measures are as follows: 1. bcg primary and multiple cropping work must be done: experience has shown that effective bcg vaccination can prevent or reduce the occurrence of brains. 2, early detection and active treatment of infectious sources: early detection of adult tuberculosis patients, especially in close contact with children such as parents, nursery nurses and kindergartens and primary school teachers, do a good job in flood prevention, strengthen adult tuberculosis management and treatment. 3, improve the body's resistance to correct feeding, a reasonable living system and adhere to planned immunization to improve the body's resistance and reduce acute infectious diseases. 4, early detection and thorough treatment of primary tuberculosis in children: early and complete cure of primary tuberculosis in children, can greatly reduce the occurrence of brain. where the clinical symptoms disappear, the cerebrospinal fluid is normal, and there is no recurrence 2 years after the end of the treatment, it can be considered as a cure, but it should continue to be observed until 5 years after the treatment is stopped. factors affecting the condition: 1. infection of the primary drug-resistant strain: the primary drug resistance of the children's brain has become a difficult problem in clinical treatment, which seriously affects the prognosis of the brain and increases the mortality rate. 2, treatment sooner or later: the later the treatment, the higher the mortality rate, 979 children, early cases without death, the mid-term child mortality rate of 3.3%, the late child mortality rate of 24.9%. 3, age: the younger the child, the faster the development of meningitis, the more serious, so the higher the mortality rate, the same severity, the infants under 3 years old are worse than the prognosis of those over 3 years old. 4, the disease type: severely damaged brain parenchyma, poor prognosis, serous type mortality rate is zero; cerebral meningitis type is 6.4%; meningoencephalitis type is 21.5%, accounting for 78.2% of all deaths. 5, with or without hydrocephalus: this is also related to the early and late stages of the disease, the combined mortality of children with hydrocephalus is far higher than the non-combined hydrocephalus, each accounting for 20% and 3.9%, some children can be treated in the process, anti-tuberculosis drugs have not fully functioned and died of cerebral palsy. 6, initial or re-treatment: re-treatment cases including recurrence or worsening, the prognosis is poor. 7. treatment: in the early stage, the prognosis should be better in the early stage, the prognosis of the child may be prolonged or chronic, and the subarachnoid space may be extensively adhered to cause hydrocephalus or spinal cord disorder. or hydronephrosis or spinal cord disorder occurs in the course of the disease, or cerebrovascular disease and cerebral infarction occur in the course of the disease, causing irreversible lesions, leading to sequelae or death. recurrence usually occurs within 2 years after the end of the treatment, and can occur even within 3 to 5 years. most of the recurrences are once, even multiple times. recurrent diseases can be detected early, treated immediately, but still completely cured, but some relapses. the efficacy of the case is not as good as the initial case, and the effect is poor.","(1) causes of the disease mycobacterium tuberculosis invades the lymphatic system and enters the local lymph nodes. the bacteremia is spread through the bloodstream into the meninges and brain parenchyma, including the subependymal and other parts, and is replicated here. when the host immune function is reduced or due to age, the tuberculosis within the lesion the bacteria activate and break into the subarachnoid space and spread with the cerebrospinal fluid, which can cause tuberculous meningitis for several days to several weeks. tuberculous meningitis is mostly part of systemic miliary tuberculosis. it spreads through blood. in 1180 cases of brains seen in beijing children's hospital from 1964 to 1977, 44.2% of miliary tuberculosis were diagnosed. in these 14 years, from the pathological anatomy of 152 cases of brain, it was found that there were 143 cases (94%) of other organs and tuberculosis in the whole body; 142 cases (93.4%) with tuberculosis (including miliary tuberculosis in the first place); 62%, 41% of renal miliary tuberculosis, and 24% of intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic tuberculosis. (two) pathogenesis tuberculosis affects the meninges mainly through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid pathway. the occurrence of brain formation is related to the high degree of hypersensitivity of the body. in addition, the brain can also be caused by the destruction of brain parenchyma or meninges, occasionally the spine, skull or middle ear the mastoid tuberculosis directly spreads to invade the meninges. pathogenesis mycobacterium tuberculosis is an aerobic bacterium. the bacterium wall is rich in a variety of lipids. tuberculosis enters the lungs through the respiratory tract, forming a small area of infection. it does not cause an immune or inflammatory reaction because it does not secrete enzymes or toxins. the host also has no symptoms. after several weeks, the bacillus invades the lymphatic system and enters the local lymph node. the bacteremia is spread through the blood into the meninges and the brain parenchyma including the subependyum and other parts, and is replicated here. when the host immune response is caused, the t lymphocytes are sensitized, the macrophages are activated and moved to the infected foci, and the macrophages can engulf the bacilli and fuse together to form multinucleated giant cells (langer hans giant cells), at which time most of the bacilli are this immune response is killed, a small amount can still be left in macrophages, this granulomatous lesion is surrounded by incomplete cyst wall tissue, its small size can exist in the meninges or brain parenchyma for many years or life. . when the host immune function is reduced or due to old age, the tuberculosis in the lesion activates and breaks into the subarachnoid space, which spreads with the cerebrospinal fluid, which can cause tuberculous meningitis for several days to several weeks, and the inflammatory reaction can increase rapidly. however, the degree is related to the hypersensitivity reaction caused by the antigenic material of the bacterial wall. a large amount of exudate produced by the inflammatory process is deposited in the brain pool, which may cause arachnoiditis with the progress of time. into the exudate, the meninges gradually proliferate and thicken, when the absorption of the meninges on the cerebrospinal fluid can cause traffic hydrocephalus, if the blockage of the fourth ventricle median and lateral holes can cause obstructive hydrocephalus. 2. pathological changes the brain is swollen, the pia mater is diffusely turbid, and the gray-yellow serum fibrinous exudate is scattered all over it. the bottom of the brain is the bridge pool, the chiasm and the frontal lobe are most prominent, and the inflammatory exudate invades the cerebral nerve sheath. the nerve fibers are wound and squeezed, and the diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration of the soft meninges can be seen under the microscope. the mononuclear cells and lymphocytes are mainly composed of a small number of macrophages and plasma cells. the pia mater can be found in the miliary tuberculous nodules. it is composed of several multinucleated giant cells, a large number of monocytes and fibroblasts, and a small amount of plasma cells. the latter is more common in the late stage. in addition, there are often caseous necrotic substances in the nodules, parenchymal edema of the brain, and sometimes tuberculosis. tumor, but its cause is not clear, the ependymal membrane and choroid plexus can show inflammatory reaction or tuberculous nodules. the cerebral arteries and the small arteries in the brain parenchyma often have vascular inflammatory changes. the inflammatory process begins with the adventitia. destruction of elastic fibers and inflammation of the endocarditis, further causing vascular occlusion, cerebral infarction or bleeding. there were some autopsy cases in which tuberculous meningitis was associated with massive hemorrhage in the brain in 1986. in cases of irregular treatment or chronic processes, meningeal fibrous connective tissue hyperplasia thickened and adhesion to the brain can cause hydrocephalus, nerves. the cells were mostly acutely swollen, the gap around the cells was widened and the glial cells in the brain parenchyma increased. domestic ma huaizhen, li wei reported a group of 65 cases of autopsy in 1988, 62 of which had extracerebral tuberculosis, more common in the lungs, bones. and lymph nodes, etc., it is considered that tuberculous meningitis is a manifestation of systemic tuberculosis.","['incapable', 'neck tough', 'appetite loss', 'irritability', 'visual edema edema', 'infant convulsions', 'low fever', 'wasting', 'stunning']",['epilepsy'],['infectious branch'],"['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(b) the pathogenesis is generally believed that susceptible children infected with group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus, produce the corresponding antibodies, such antibodies incorrectly identified the caudate nucleus, antigens of the subthalamic nucleus neurons, causing inflammation disease. uncomplicated acute chorea rarely dies, so there are few pathological data, but most authors believe that the main pathological changes of this disease are scattered in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and cerebellar dentate nucleus. arteritis and neuronal degeneration, even spotted hemorrhage can be seen, sometimes the brain tissue can present a small embolic small infarction, the pia mater can have mild inflammatory changes, and a small amount of lymphocyte infiltration around the blood vessels. evidence of rheumatic heart disease can be found in 90% of cases of autopsy.","['attention is not concentrated', 'involuntary movement', 'stationary doctor', 'atcoxia', 'muscle tension reduction', 'breathing irregularity']",['mental disorder'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
neonatal seizure,"neonatal seizures are a symptom of a temporary disorder of central nervous system function caused by various diseases, and can also be called convulsions and convulsions.congenital convulsions in newborns often indicate serious illness.and the performance is not typical, it is difficult to identify, often misdiagnosed, so the mortality rate is high, and there are more sequelae.","do a good job in pregnancy health care, actively prevent and cure various infectious diseases during pregnancy, prevent premature birth and maternal diabetes, hypocalcemia, etc.; do perinatal health care, prevent hypoxia and damage during intrauterine production, prevent hie, ich; prevention of metabolic abnormalities; also need to do genetic counseling to prevent genetic metabolic diseases, chromosomal diseases, and also reduce the incidence of congenital malformations of the central nervous system.","(1) causes of thediseasewith the advancement of diagnostic techniques, the etiology of neonatal seizures has been enriched. in recent years, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (hie) has leapt to the top of the cause, while the proportion of infection and metabolic factors has been earlier. decreased, causing a large number of causes of neonatal seizures, according to the rate of decline in 9 categories, the previous 4 categories are the most common. 1. perinatal complications: hie, intracranial hemorrhage, brain damage. 2, infection: meningitis caused by various pathogens, encephalitis, brain abscess, infection with toxic encephalopathy, tetanus, high fever. 3, metabolic factors: low blood calcium, low blood magnesium, low blood sodium, high blood sodium, hypoglycemia, alkalosis, vitamin b6 deficiency, nuclear jaundice, uremia. 4, cerebral hypoxia: hyaline membrane disease, meconium aspiration syndrome, pulmonary hemorrhage, acute cardiogenic cerebral ischemia syndrome, hypertension, polycythemia, fever syndrome. 5, brain abnormalities: congenital brain dysplasia, craniocerebral malformations, intracranial tumors. 6, congenital enzyme defects: maple diabetes, urea circulatory disorders, hyperglycemia, propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, isovaleric acid, galactosemia, vitamin b6 dependence. 7, familial: benign familial epilepsy, adrenal white matter atrophy, neurocutaneous syndrome, zellwegen syndrome, smith-lemli-opitz syndrome. 8, drugs: stimulants, isoniazid, aminophylline, local anesthetics, organic phosphorus, withdrawal syndrome. 9, the cause is unknown: about 3% of neonatal seizures. it is worth noting that some children may have multiple diseases at the same time, such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy with hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia or hyponatremia. (two) pathogenesis the incidence of neonatal seizures is high, and its manifestations and eeg are also very different from those of adults and children. the neonatal central nervous system is still immature and susceptible to various pathological factors. and when the cerebral cortex is highly inhibited, it is prone to abnormal discharge of the subcortical center or brain stem release phenomena. at the same time, the cerebral cortex of the neonatal cerebral cortex and the membrane of the neuron, incomplete cytoplasmic differentiation, dendrites, synapses, and myelin formation are also imperfect. the normal connection between neurons and glia is not established. when abnormal local discharge occurs in the cortex, it is difficult to conduct and spread to adjacent sites. it is not easy to spread to the contralateral hemisphere to cause synchronous discharge, so convulsions of generalized tonicity in neonatal seizures are rare. convulsions require a synchronized discharge of a group of neurons, that is, the number of excited neurons needs to reach a certain threshold. the permeability of the cell membrane of neonatal cerebral cortical neurons is strong, sodium ions are easy to enter, potassium ions are easily leaked, and the membrane the sodium-potassium pump function and atp level are significantly lower than those of mature neurons. it is not easy to pump sodium ions and repolarize quickly and effectively, but in a relatively high polarization state, it is difficult to produce rapid repetitive discharge and cause nearby neurons. synchronous discharge, so neonatal cortical convulsions are relatively rare, sometimes only a few neurons discharge, did not reach the threshold of causing clinical convulsions, constitute a subclinical type with only eeg abnormal discharge without clinical convulsions. neonatal cerebral temporal lobe and diencephalon, brain stem, limbic system, hippocampus, substantia nigra, reticular activation system and other subcortical structures are relatively mature, and their oxidative metabolism is more vigorous, more sensitive to hypoxia, in various pathologies. under the stimulation of factors, subcortical convulsions are easily present, manifested as paroxysmal mouth, cheeks, tiny twitching of the eyelids, gaze, abnormal movement of the eyeball, and autonomic seizures such as salivation, pupillage, complexion, respiration, heart rate and blood pressure. changes, etc., the mechanism of episodes of subcortical seizures may be due to abnormal discharge of the subcortical gray matter, this deep abnormal discharge, the eeg of the eeg can not be found; or the brain caused by brain damage is highly inhibited dry release phenomenon, clinically 60% to 90% of children with convulsions have no cortical abnormal discharge, so the positive eeg findings can help confirm the diagnosis, no abnormal discharge can not negate the convulsions.","['newborn's eyes gaze up', 'trembling', 'baby sputum', 'neonatal convulsions', 'muscle palsy', 'consciousness disorder', 'yan feng', 'sense is unclear', ' smoking ', 'infant and child convulsions', 'stunning']",['newborn asphyxia'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric medicine']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

(2) the role of 污-aminobutyric acid and adenosine: 污-aminobutyric acid (gaba) and adenosine are present in the white matter of the central nervous system, and there are no synaptic terminals in the white matter, so these neuroactive substances are not synaptic release, and more likely due to the reverse action of na and membrane potential-dependent uptake proteins. (3) discussion of the mechanism of action: in general, gaba and adenosine act on completely different specific receptors to exert intracellular effects, but in hypoxic white matter, gaba and adenosine appear to act on the same intracellular components. this protective effect is necessary because of the limited potency of gaba and adenosine produced by white matter. extracellular extracellular gaba and adenosine molecules stimulate the intracellular sequential response of the receptor, thereby increasing the tolerance of cells to hypoxia. gaba acts on gaba-汕 receptor, which is coupled to intracellular protein kinase c (protein kinase). c, pkc), activated pkc transfers phosphate to a variety of intracellular proteins, resulting in altered function of the latter. k outflow and na influx caused by hypoxic damage of white matter, leading to the reverse opening of na-ca2 translocation protein, promote ca2 into cells, hypoxia is also associated with endogenous gaba, adenosine release, activated gaba-汕 receptors and adenosine receptors activate intracellular pkc via g-protein coupling. protein kinase c activation is often associated with downregulation of membrane-operating proteins. pkc may also down-regulate hypoxic white na channels and affect na influx.","['coma', 'inactive silence', 'dementia', 'thinking inconsistency', 'sleeping', 'graphic disorientation', 'slow response', 'near-forgetting phenomenon', 'breathing irregularity']",['coma'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

syncope,"syncope is a clinical syndrome, also known as fainting.this disease is caused by a sudden decrease in the whole cerebral blood flow, a temporary blood supply to the brain or insufficient oxygen supply, resulting in the inhibition of the reticular structure and loss of consciousness, which lasts for a few seconds to several minutes; the posture tension cannot be maintained during the attack, so it cannot stand. and fainted, but recovered faster.","if you feel that syncope is about to occur, assuming that the cause is a temporary drop in blood pressure, there are two simple ways to avoid loss of consciousness. the first method is to cross the legs, compress the abdominal muscles, and squeeze the veins of the legs (the veins in the legs) blood flows to the heart) and stimulates the nervous system to contract the artery (increased blood pressure) to increase blood pressure. the second method is to grasp the other hand with one hand and then straighten the arms. drinking two glasses of water, although not effective immediately, may prevent syncope within 30 to 60 minutes. the reason may be to supplement the blood volume. similar suggestions are to sit down and bury your head between your legs. this will make you feel better. sit down to avoid syncope and bury your head between your legs to get more blood from your brain. if syncope has occurred, it is best to let the patient lie flat on the ground, so that the cardiovascular system does not have to fight gravity, and the patient's body is turned to one side to avoid aspiration. it is wrong to make people sit after fainting, because blood can't be used. do not flow up to the brain.","causes of cardiac irritation, sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, pre-excitation syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, long qt syndrome, arrhythmogenic right dysplasia, aortic stenosis, cardiac myxoma, primary cardiomyopathy, secondary cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, mitral valve prolapse syndrome, viral myocarditis, infective endocarditis, pericardial disease, heart valvular thrombosis, pacemaker syndrome, congenital heart disease, etc. other factors a. metabolic syncope: hypoglycemia, hyperventilation syndrome, hyponatremia, etc.;

hereditary ataxia,"hereditary ataxia (hereditaryataxia) is a group of hereditary degenerative diseases characterized by chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia; the genetic background passed down from generation to generation, the ataxia manifestation and the pathological changes dominated by cerebellar damage are three major features.in addition to the involvement of the cerebellum and conductive fibers, this group of diseases often involve the posterior column of the spinal cord, pyramidal tract, pons nucleus, basal ganglia, cranial nerve nucleus, spinal ganglia and autonomic nervous system.the ataxia gait first appears and gradually worsens, eventually causing the patient to stay in bed, with complex clinical symptoms and overlapping, even if the same family can exhibit high heterogeneity.","genetic counseling should be carried out. preventive measures include avoidance of close relatives, genetic testing of carriers and prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion to prevent the birth of the child. the disease develops slowly, such as no serious cardiopulmonary complications, most of which do not affect life. a small number of patients are bedridden and disabled.","cerebellar ataxia (ca) is an autosomal dominant inheritance. in recent years, some subtype genes have been cloned and sequenced, showing that the causal gene trinucleotide (such as cag) repeats dynamic mutations, copy number generation is the cause of the disease. autosomal dominant cerebral cerebral ataxia has genetic heterogeneity, and the most characteristic gene defect is that the amplified cag trinucleotide repeat encodes a polyglutamine channel, which is a functionally unknown protein ( ataxins) and p/q-type calcium channel 汐1a subunits found on nerve endings; other types of mutations include ctg trinucleotide (sca8) and attct pentanucleotide (sca10) repeat amplification, in many cases this the size of the amplified fragment is related to the severity of the disease, and the younger the age of onset, the heavier the condition. friedreich type ataxia (frda) is caused by the abnormal amplification of the gaa trinucleotide repeat of the non-coding region of the frataxin gene of the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q13-12.1). the normal gaa is amplified more than 42 times, and the patient is ablated. (66 to 1700 times) formation of an abnormal helical structure can inhibit gene transcription. pathogenesis cerebellar ataxia (adca) pathological changes mainly manifested cerebellum, spinal cord and brain stem degeneration, so it is also known as spinocerebellar ataxia (sca), according to clinical characteristics and gene mapping into sca1 ~ 21 subtypes . scas mutations alter the properties of proteins that are not normally processed. the abnormally processed fragments bind to a ubiquitin that is involved in non-lysosomal degradation and are transported together as a protease complex. in the nucleus, it is speculated that this nuclear protein aggregation can affect the function of the nucleus. each sca subtype gene is located on a different chromosome, with different sizes and gene mutation sites. for example, the sca1 gene is located on chromosome 6q22-23, and the genome span is 450kb. the cdna is 11kb long and contains 9 exons. it encodes 816 amino acid residues to form the ataxia-1 protein. the protein is located in the nucleus. the cag mutation is located in exon 8 with an amplified copy number of 40-83 and a normal human 6~. 38, sca3 (mjd) is the most common sca subtype in china, the gene is located in 14q24.3-32, contains at least 4 exons, encodes 960 amino acid residues to form ataxia-3 protein, distributed in the cytoplasm, cag mutation located in exon 4, the amplified copy number is 61-89, and the normal person is 12-41. although sca has a common genetic mutation mechanism, resulting in similar clinical manifestations of different subtypes, there are still differences, such as with ophthalmoplegia, and some with retinitis pigmentosa, pathological lesions and extent are different, suggesting that in addition to polygeneration in addition to the toxic effects of glutamine, other factors may also be involved in the onset of the disease. the common pathological changes of sca are mainly cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord degeneration and atrophy, but each subtype also has its characteristics. for example, sca1 is mainly cerebellum, brainstem neurons are lost, spinal cord cerebellar tract and posterior cord are damaged, and rarely involved. substantia nigra, basal ganglia and anterior horn cells; sca2 below the olive nucleus, pons, cerebellar damage is heavy; sca3 mainly damages the pons and spinal cerebellar tract; sca7 is characterized by retinal neuronal degeneration. the friedreich-type ataxia (frda) gene product frataxin protein is present in the mitochondrial inner membrane of the spinal cord, skeletal muscle, heart and liver, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the onset of disease. the more repeated the expansion, the earlier the onset of the disease, the visible spinal cord changes fine, thoracic segment; microscopically showed posterior cord, spinal cord cerebellar tract and corticospinal degeneration, loss of posterior root ganglia and clarke column neurons, peripheral gliosis, brainstem, cerebellum and brain involvement, light heart the heart muscle is enlarged and enlarged.","['fatigue', 'ovear atrophy', 'upper ptosis', 'tendon reflection disappears', 'capitalism',  'inconsistent limb movement', 'sensing disorder']",['respiratory infection'],"['internal medicine', 'neurology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

amenorrhea,"amenorrhea is a common symptom in gynecological diseases and can be caused by a variety of different causes.amenorrhea is usually divided into primary and secondary.those who have not passed the age of 18 years old are called primary amenorrhea; after menarche, any time before normal menopause (except pregnancy or lactation), menstrual closure for more than 6 months is called secondary amenorrhea .this distinction is largely artificial, as the underlying factors that cause primary and secondary amenorrhea may sometimes be the same.","1, less menstruation or late menstruation can develop into amenorrhea, actively cure less menstruation or later, can reduce the incidence of amenorrhea. 2, to determine the etiology and location of amenorrhea, the treatment of amenorrhea effect and prognosis have a certain reference value, the following hypothalamic amenorrhea, caused by mental factors, environmental changes, malnutrition, etc., drug treatment prognosis is better, and such as tuberculosis uterine amenorrhea caused by bacilli, the endometrium has been destroyed, the possibility of restoring menstruation is less, and if the progesterone test is positive (after progesterone can be transferred), the prognosis is better. 3, in the chinese medical literature, there are those who do not come to menstruation for a lifetime, called ""dark classics"", which requires caution, carefully ask the medical history before using the drug. 4. there are many women taking diet pills at present. some women have amenorrhea due to obesity. they also have diet due to obesity, resulting in anorexia and amenorrhea. there are many abortions and amenorrhea. the above amenorrhea can be prevented. some drugs must be taken under the guidance of a doctor to prevent adverse reactions. 5, for the intractable amenorrhea alone with traditional chinese medicine or western medicine, the effect of poor treatment can be combined with chinese and western medicine cycle treatment, after the onset of treatment gradually reduce the amount of western medicine, and ultimately chinese medicine treatment.","the cause of amenorrhea in the uterus, although the ovarian function is normal, but the endometrium can not produce a normal response, so do not come to menstruation, causing uterine closure often seen diseases: (1) congenital uterine hypoplasia or lack of: embryonic due to secondary renal tube dysplasia or non-development, manifested as primary amenorrhea, after puberty, secondary sexual characteristics such as breast, external genitalia, yin, mane, etc. are normal development, if the basal body temperature can sometimes show ovulation, it can also show periodic breast tenderness and abdominal discomfort. the chromosomes and gonads are normal women. all kinds of ovarian hormones and pituitary gonadotropin fsh, lh, etc. are in normal female level. pelvic examination and b-ultrasound confirmed no uterus. primary amenorrhea with periodic abdominal pain should be considered congenital uterus or vaginal deformity, such as vaginal septum or hymen atresia, due to poor genital tract, menstrual blood can not be discharged, b-ultrasound can be found uterine hemorrhage and vaginal blood, surgery opens the passage to restore normal menstruation, and congenital uterine hypoplasia or absence will never have menstruation. (2) endometrial injury or adhesion: often occurs after artificial abortion, postpartum or abortion curettage, due to excessive scratching injury to the endometrium, or postoperative infection caused by intrauterine adhesions, amenorrhea, when the uterine cavity adhesion at the time, the menstrual blood can not flow out, manifested as amenorrhea accompanied by periodic abdominal pain and falling sense, the symptoms are compared with the basal body temperature, or b-ultrasound found uterine hemorrhage, the diagnosis can be confirmed. some infections such as tuberculous endometritis, abortion or severe postpartum endometritis can cause damage to the endometrium, leading to amenorrhea, usually secondary amenorrhea, if the girl infected with endometrial tuberculosis before puberty hair amenorrhea. (3) uterine treatment: uterine amenorrhea can occur after uterus or endometrial resection or intrauterine radiation therapy. (4) androgen insensitivity syndrome: also known as testicular feminization, this is a special form of uterine amenorrhea, the patient's karyotype is 46, xy, the gonad is the testis, due to the lack of androgen receptors in the target organ or the body can not develop normal biological function, so it can not develop into a normal male. the full-type testicular feminization looks like a woman, has breast development, but the uterus lacks the upper part of the vagina as a blind end. patients often have a primary amenorrhea after puberty. . (1) congenital ovarian hypoplasia: also known as turner syndrome, is the most common type of adolescent girls with amenorrhea, which is a disease of abnormal sex chromosomes, most of which are abnormal x chromosome number, the basic karyotype is 45, x, can also be abnormal for sex chromosome structure, such as x chromosome and other arms, long arm or short arm deletion, circular x chromosome, etc., and some are multiple karyotype chimeras, patients with this disease in addition to primary amenorrhea and if the sexual characteristics are not developed, there is a group of abnormal physical manifestations, such as short stature, neck sputum, faceted sputum, barrel chest, elbow valgus and other deformities. a few cases with 46, xx chimerism may be secondary. amenorrhea or occasional normal menstruation.(3) premature ovarian failure: also known as early menopause, that is, menopause occurs before the age of 40, occasionally seen in young women under the age of 20, most of them are secondary amenorrhea, rarely primary amenorrhea, ovarian atrophy, low estrogen levels, fsh liters up to the level of menopause, the true mechanism of premature ovarian failure is not very clear, it has been observed that premature ovarian failure is related to the autoimmune system, because the premature ovarian failure is often accompanied by a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as addison disease, thyroiditis, parathyroid function. low, myasthenia gravis, diabetes, etc., can detect antibodies against ovarian tissue. it has been observed that there are anti-gonadotrophin receptor antibodies on the ovary, which hinders the binding of fsh to receptors on the cell membrane. it has also been reported that there are families with premature ovarian failure. factors, early menopause in the patient's mother or sister. (2) simple gonadal dysplasia: including 46, xx simple gonadal dysplasia and 46, xy simple gonadal dysplasia, except for karyotype, the clinical manifestations are similar, both manifested as primary amenorrhea, secondary sexual development is not developed the height is high, the limbs are long, the body shape is castrated, the gonads are mostly cord-like, and the gonads with karyotype xy are prone to tumors. peking union medical college hospital has reported 5 cases of xy simple gonadal dysplasia, all of which have been removed, and pathologically confirmed. there have been tumors, including 2 cases of gonadal cell tumor, 1 case of sexomyma and supporting cell tumor, so xy simple gonadal dysplasia should be surgically removed as soon as possible.(4) ovarian insensitivity syndrome: clinical manifestations with premature ovarian failure, may be primary amenorrhea or early menopause, and different from premature ovarian failure, there are many normal follicles in the ovary of such patients, but in a state of rest, unable to develop mature and ovulation, the pathogenesis of ovarian insensitivity syndrome is not very clear, more explanation is that the ovary has anti-gonadotrophin receptor antibody or receptor bio-function disorder, the reproductive hormone changes of the disease is the same as premature ovarian failure, if b-ultrasound or laparoscopy sees that the ovary does not shrink and there are small follicles, it can be differentiated from premature ovarian failure.(5) ovariectomy syndrome: ovariectomy or tissue destruction, mostly due to surgical removal of bilateral ovaries or bilateral ovaries after radiation therapy, ovarian tissue is destroyed and loss of function, manifested as primary or secondary amenorrhea, severe ovary inflammation can also destroy ovarian tissue and cause amenorrhea.(1) primary pituitary gonadotropin: it is a rare genetic disease, characterized by isolated gonadotropin deficiency, patients often have primary amenorrhea, sexual characteristics are not developed, and some are accompanied by olfactory disorders, pituitary gonads hormones fsh and lh and ovarian sex hormones are low levels.(2) secondary anterior pituitary dysfunction: due to pituitary injury, hemorrhage, inflammation, radiation and surgery destroy the function of the anterior pituitary, causing gonadotropins and other hormones in the anterior pituitary, such as thyroid stimulating hormone and adrenal cortex lack of hormones, etc., in addition to hypogonadism, sometimes hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency, showing amenorrhea, weight loss, fatigue, cold, hypoglycemia, hypotension, low basal metabolism and loss of libido, etc. because of postpartum hemorrhage, xihan syndrome, which occurs in the anterior pituitary tissue caused by shock, is a typical case of secondary hypopituitarism. (3) pituitary tumors: also a common cause of pituitary amenorrhea, can directly disrupt the function of the anterior pituitary or destroy the regulation channel between the hypothalamus and the pituitary, interfere with the secretion and regulation of reproductive hormones, leading to amenorrhea, pituitary tumors there are many types, such as growth hormone tumor, prolactinoma, thyroid stimulating hormone adenoma, adrenocortical adenoma, mixed tumor of gonadotropin adenoma and non-functional pituitary adenoma, the most common pituitary related to amenorrhea. the tumor is a prolactinoma. refers to an obstacle in the hypothalamus or hypothalamus, due to hypoxia-derived gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) deficiency or secreted form of dysregulation leading to amenorrhea, including hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, central nervous system-hypothalamic dysfunction, and other endocrine abnormal amenorrhea caused by inappropriate feedback regulation of the hypothalamus. (1) hypothalamic-pituitary unit dysfunction: may be congenital hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, may also be secondary to injury, tumor, inflammation and radiation caused by hypothalamic hormone gnrh synthesis and secretion disorders, clinical the most common hypothalamic-pituitary unit dysfunction caused by amenorrhea is hyperprolactinemia, which is due to the hypothalamic prolactin inhibitor (mainly dopamine) deficiency, which causes the pituitary to secrete excessive prolactin, in addition, any other causes hinder the inhibition of prolactin secretion by dopamine, which can cause hyperprolactinemia. for example, tumor compression of the pituitary stalk can block the inhibition of prolactin secretion by dopamine. some drugs can consume dopamine or block dopamine. receptor action increases prolactin secretion, such as metoclopramide (metamethoxazole), chlorpromazine (hibernation) and other drugs, other pituitary adenomas, hypothyroidism, sucking nipples and chest irritation can also cause increased prolactin secretion, elevated prolactin levels can also act on the hypothalamus, inhibit the synthesis and release of gnrh, act on the pituitary, reduce the sensitivity of the pituitary to gnrh, act on the egg in addition to amenorrhea, lactation is often one of the important manifestations of hyperprolactinemia. however, many patients cannot find lactation by themselves. about half of them are due to amenorrhea or irregular menstruation. , laboratory tests will find elevated levels of blood prolactin, > 30 ng / ml, follicle stimulating hormone (fsh), luteinizing hormone (lh) is comparable to or lower than the normal early follicular phase, estrogen levels are low, except pituitary tumors should be examined in the imaging area of the sellar region. if necessary, the visual field should be examined to alert the tumor to the visual field defect caused by oppression of the optic nerve. (2) central-hypothalamic dysfunction: mental factors, changes in the external or internal environment can lead to amenorrhea through the central nervous system through the neuroendocrine pathways of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus, or through the limbic system to influence hypothalamic function. in young women, the more common typical conditions such as mental stimulation, emotional stress or sudden amenorrhea after changing the environment, fsh, lh and estradiol (e2) levels can be in the normal range, due to the interference of gnrh pulse secretion rhythm no ovulation, resulting in amenorrhea, due to deliberate weight loss, the pursuit of slim body caused by anorexia nervosa is common in young girls, they from dieting to anorexia or the formation of quirky eating habits, severe weight loss, amenorrhea, resulting in thyroid, adrenal gland, gonads and the function of multiple organs such as the pancreas is low, and even water and electrolyte disturbances and extreme malnutrition are life-threatening. most of these patients can be asked for medical history related to mental and psychological factors. generally, fsh, lh and e2 levels are low, in addition, false pregnancy it is also a central hypothalamic dysfunction caused by mental and psychological factors, often born child eager hope of infertile women. (3) other endocrine abnormalities cause inappropriate feedback regulation: 1 excessive androgen: excessive androgen can come from the ovary and/or adrenal gland. the most common clinically among adolescent women is polycystic ovary syndrome. its main pathophysiological characteristics are excessive androgen and persistent anovulation, manifested as amenorrhea or menstrual disorders, hairy and obese, and a series of symptoms and signs of polycystic enlargement of the ovary. excessive androgen is mainly derived from the ovary. partly from the adrenal gland, the increased androgen is converted to estrogen in the surrounding tissue. this continuous non-periodic estrogen conversion increases the sensitivity of the pituitary to gn-rh, resulting in increased lh secretion and loss of periodicity. the fsh is relatively insufficient. the level of androgen in the blood circulation of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome is about 50% to 100% higher than that of normal women. if the androgen is abnormally elevated, it should be distinguished from other conditions, such as ovarian or adrenal gland secretion. hormone tumors, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and other sexual dysplasia caused by enzyme deficiency. congenital adrenal hyperplasia is another common androgenic condition in girls. it is due to the lack of an enzyme in the adrenal cortex during the synthesis of steroids to produce excessive androgen, making the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in addition to irregular menstruation or amenorrhea, the patient often has varying degrees of masculinization and even genital malformations. 2 thyroid hormone abnormalities: thyroid hormones participate in the metabolism of various substances in the body, therefore, too much or too little thyroid hormone can directly affect reproductive hormones and reproductive function, such as some patients with hyperthyroidism can show less menstruation or amenorrhea. 3 secretory hormone tumors: more common in ovarian and adrenal tumors, excessive secretion of sex hormones through the feedback mechanism can inhibit the secretion regulation of the hypothalamus and pituitary, destroy its periodicity, leading to anovulation or amenorrhea, according to blood estrogen or the abnormal increase in androgen levels can be used to judge the nature of the hormone secreted by the tumor. careful pelvic examination, imaging examination of the corresponding parts, such as pelvic and adrenal b-ultrasound, ct scan, mri, etc. contribute to the diagnosis of the tumor. 4 exercise and amenorrhea: athletes, ballerinas, etc. due to engaging in large-volume activities, too little fat in the body, exercise amenorrhea, energy consumption and mental stress of training and competition can affect neuroendocrine and metabolic functions, making the hypothalamic gnrh abnormal secretion, leading to amenorrhea. 5 drug-induced amenorrhea: some drugs can affect hypothalamic function and cause amenorrhea, especially thiazide sedatives, high-dose applications can often cause amenorrhea lactation, menstruation can be restored after stopping the drug, a few women inject long-acting injectables or long-term oral high-dose contraceptives lead to secondary amenorrhea, which is caused by the drug's persistent inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. 6 obesity: obesity is sometimes accompanied by other endocrine abnormalities. here, it refers to simple obesity. the body weight is closely related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. adipose tissue is the place where estrogen accumulates and is the main part of androgen conversion to estrogen. a large amount of adipose tissue leads to an increase in estrogen. this non-periodic estrogen produces a continuous inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary body through a feedback mechanism, resulting in anovulation or amenorrhea.","['polycystic ovary', 'pulsating headache', 'uterine amenorrhea', 'secondary amenorrhea', 'sportable amenorrhea', 'pituitary dysfunction', 'last milk secretion after delivery', 'pituitary amenorrhea' , 'menopausal transition period and absolutely...', 'postpartum menstruation no longer comes to the tide']",['premature ovarian failure'],"['gynecology and obstetrics', 'gynecology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'symptomatic treatment']"

relatively insufficient thyroid hormone, increased secretion of tsh in the pituitary gland to cause thyroid compensatory enlargement, but not accompanied by abnormal thyroid function.the enlarged thyroid tissue is followed by irregular hyperplasia and regeneration, and the nodules are called nodular goiter, which is divided into endemic and sporadic goiter.simple goiter is a goiter with normal thyroid function. it is a compensated goiter caused by iodine deficiency, thyroid mass or related enzyme deficiency. it is not accompanied by obvious hyperthyroidism or decrease. it is called non-toxic goiter, which is characterized by excretion in non-endemic goiter epidemic areas, and is not associated with tumors and inflammation. the thyroid gland is mostly diffusely enlarged at the beginning of the disease, and can develop into multinodular enlargement in the future.","1. for residents with endemic goiter epidemic areas, collective prevention should be done. in the iodine-deficient area, it is most effective and convenient to use iodized salt. the concentration is generally 1:10000. the lipiodol muscle injection is suitable for infants and young children. the formation of iodine storage, the absorption is very slow, the effect is better than iodized salt, <1 year old, with 125mg (including iodine), 1 to 4 years old 250mg, 5 to 9 years old 750mg, > 10 years old 1000mg. 2, 40 years of age or older, especially in patients with nodular goiter, should avoid eating too much iodine-containing substances, so as to avoid iodine hyperthyroidism. sporadic high-iodine goiter, try to avoid the use of iodine or reduce the amount of their use for close observation and follow-up, should also pay attention to the use of iodine in pregnant women, to avoid neonatal iodine-induced goiter, and even suffocation death, local high iodine sexual goiter should filter and adsorb water and food to reduce the amount of iodine. iodine-deficient scattered goiter should be added with iodine salt, ie, sodium iodide or potassium iodide in salt, more than 1:10000 (0.01%), 150-200米g of iodine per day has been used for prevention, iodine used in countries around the world. the salt content varies, depending on the specific requirements. it is usually in the range of 1:100,000 to 10,000 (0.001% to 0.01%). in recent years, the domestic application of lipiodol injection has been used to prevent and treat it. one-time injection of 1.5ml of iodized oil (containing 1000mg of iodine) can maintain the curative effect for 5 years, the thyroid can be significantly reduced, the child needs more than the adult (calculated by kilogram body weight), about 1 year old is 125mg iodine content, 2 ~ 4 the age is 250mg containing iodine, 5-9 years old is 750mg iodine content, the age of 10 years old can reach 900~1000mg iodine content, because iodized oil is absorbed very slowly in the body, should be followed up every year after use, observe the effect. china has a vast territory and different terrain. there are high-iodine areas in the inland areas such as xiaoyi county of shanxi province, which can coexist with inland iodine deficiency. coastal high iodine areas such as rizhao county of shandong province can coexist with iodine deficiency in mountainous areas. the phenomenon of mutual neighboring, and therefore can not be unified with iodine prevention, because it is unfavorable for patients with high iodine goiter, easy to cause hyperthyroidism, should cause attention, prevention and treatment of goiter must be investigated separately in each province and city, after obtaining basic data for analysis different treatment can effectively prevent sporadic simple goiter and endemic goiter.","in the mountainous areas far away from the sea in china, such as yunnan-guizhou plateau and shaanxi, shanxi, ningxia and other places, because the soil iodized salt in the mountainous area is washed away, and the food and drinking water contain insufficient iodine, there are many people who have this disease. for ""endemic goiter"", in the absence of raw material ""iodine"", and the thyroid function still needs to maintain normal needs, the secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone in the anterior pituitary is increased, thus causing compensatory enlargement of the thyroid gland. during puberty, pregnancy, lactation and menopause, the body's metabolism is strong, the demand for thyroid hormones increases, causing excessive secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone for a long period of time, and can also promote goiter, which is a kind of swelling. physiological phenomena, often shrinking by themselves after adult or pregnancy lactation. some simple goiters occur due to a certain obstacle in the process of biosynthesis and secretion of glandular hormones. for example, peroxyacid salts, sulphates, nitrates, etc. in thyroid substances can interfere with thyroid uptake of inorganic iodides. : sulfonamides, thiourea and vegetables containing thioureas (radish, cabbage) can prevent the synthesis of thyroid hormones, thereby causing a decrease in blood thyroid hormones, thus enhancing the anterior pituitary thyroid stimulating the secretion of hormones promotes thyroid enlargement. similarly, the lack of congenital defects of recessive inheritance, such as peroxidase or proteolytic enzymes, can also cause thyroid hormone biosynthesis or secretion disorders, leading to goiter. pathogenesis has recently increased the understanding of themechanismof simple goiter, that is, there may be a thyroid growth immunoglobulin (tci) in this patient, which has tsh-like stimulation of thyroid growth, but no tsh or igg-like can promote the variability of thyroid function. therefore, patients have no hyperthyroidism. this autoimmune mechanism may cause other autoimmune diseases in patients with simple goiter and their relatives. when the goiter is too large, surgery is performed. after subtotal resection, the goiter is prone to recurrence and has been found clinically, and the detailed mechanism remains to be studied. catz reported that about 21.7% of patients with nodular goiter could be associated with hashimoto's disease. tianjin medical university reported 552 cases of nodular goiter. there were 45 cases with varying degrees of thyroiditis (8.2%). there were 14 cases of diffuse inflammation, 30 cases of focal inflammation, and 1 case of granulomatous inflammation, which was significantly higher than endemic goiter complicated with thyroiditis. this nodular goiter may have cellular immunity or thyroid autonomic regulation. as a result, there was no significant difference in serum tsh and thyroid-free patients with simple diffuse goiter, suggesting that diffuse goiter does not rely on elevated serum tsh levels, and serum tsh in nodular goiter is more diffuse. low and no enlargement, indicating that the thyroid function of nodular goiter is autonomously regulated, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function study found that 61% of trh stimulation test, its tsh response is lower than normal, thyroid function t3 and t4 are normal levels, and the t3 and t4 levels of a few patients may be increased or decreased.","['gynecologic enlargement', 'stationary doctor', 'sound hoarseness', 'goiter', 'difficulty swallowing', 'thyroid gland and smooth...',

polycystic ovary syndrome,polycystic ovary syndrome is an endocrine disease in which the ovary is enlarged and contains many fluid-filled sacs with elevated androgen levels and inability to ovulate.the most striking feature is anovulation.,"daily prevention of polycystic ovary syndrome 1. patients with polycystic ovary who are overweight should be scientifically lose weight . patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (bmi>24) should lose weight in an effective and healthy way: including about 500 calories per day. calorie intake allows the body weight to be carried out at a safe rate of about 2 kg per month. 2, polycystic ovary syndrome treatment to optimize diet and diet adjustment is an important adjuvant treatment of pcos, in addition to total calories, for patients who reach standard weight or originally not fat, choose food should be careful. in order to avoid the lack of absorption of controlled diet, 500-1500 mg (mg) calcium tablets and a comprehensive vitamin containing 400 米g (mcg) folic acid should be added daily, and the daily water should reach 8 cups of water; to avoid blood lipid abnormalities eat less saturated fatty acids and hydrogenated fatty acids, such as pork, beef and mutton, fatty meat, various poultry and livestock skins, cream, artificial cream, whole milk, fried food, chinese and western cakes; fish, protein, beans, nuts it is a good source of protein. 3, the right amount of exercise regular exercise can help blood sugar, blood lipids, blood pressure control. polycystic ovary syndrome health education 1, polycystic ovary syndrome is a major manifestation of endocrine disorders, ovarian ovulation abnormalities, whether to curb the development of the disease, or prevent problems before, diet should pay attention to, try to avoid each kind of incentive. 2, pay attention to the diet structure the more fat you accumulate in your body, the greater the risk factor. low-fat, low-sugar, low-calorie diet, optimized diet, balanced nutrition can help health. 3, improve the exercise index appropriate exercise to promote the body's blood circulation, improve the body's immunity, is conducive to endocrine coordination. the latest research shows that women with long-term lack of exercise have a significantly increased incidence of endocrine disorders. 4, good mood care for health depression, anger and fear and other negative emotions will stimulate the fragile nerves, destroy the regulation of endocrine, reduce the body's immunity, directly affecting women's health.","pcos is an autosomal dominant inheritance, or x-linked (associated) inheritance, or a disease caused by a genetic mutation. most patients have a karyotype of 46, xx, and some patients have chromosomal aberrations or chimeric types such as 46, xx. /45, xo; 46, xx/46, xxq and 46, xxq, pcos originated from pre-pubertal adrenal gland disease, that is, when stimulated by intense stress, the reticular band secretes excessive androgen and is converted to estrone outside the gonads. feedback-induced gnrh-gnh release rhythm disorder in hp axis, lh/fsh ratio increased, secondary to increased ovarian androgen production, that is, adrenal gland and ovary secrete more androgen to cause hyperandrogenism, hyperandrogen blood the disease causes thickening of the fibrosis in the ovary, inhibits follicular development and eggs, and causes cystic enlargement of the ovary and chronic anovulation. in patients with pcos, blood lh is elevated, while fsh is normal or decreased. lh/fsh is ≡2 to 3. lh may be overreactive after intravenous injection of gnrh, suggesting that it may be primary to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, dopaminergic energy in the hypothalamus. the opioid peptide nerve can inhibit the inhibition of gnrh neurons, which can lead to an increase in lh secretion, but it is more likely to be caused by abnormal feedback inhibition of estrogen. the non-cyclical extra-adeno-estrogened estrogen (estrone e1) will lead to positive feedback on lh secretion and negative feedback inhibition on fsh secretion. lh stimulates follicular cell proliferation, produces a large number of androgens, and androgen cannot be completely converted into estrogen, further increasing the production of extracellular aromatized e1, excessive androgen follicular atresia, ovarian envelope fibrosis and thickening of the capsule, due to lack of lh peak in the middle of the menstrual cycle, ovulation disorders, in addition, it has been found that pcos patients' ovaries may also secrete ""inhibin"", inhibit the secretion of fsh, affect the follicles are mature and have more cystic follicles. in recent years, hyperinsulinemia and increased igf have also increased lh secretion. in pcos, almost all androgen production increases, while sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg) decreases, free androgen increases, and activity increases. as for the excessive androgen derived from the ovary or adrenal gland, large doses of gnrh are excited. the agent can reduce gonadotropin, androstenedione and testosterone, but has no effect on dheas derived from the adrenal gland. it is reported that about 70% of pcos patients are caused by ovarian-derived androgens: 1 due to steroid hormones required enzyme system dysfunction, such as aromatase deficiency, 3汕-mellow dehydrogenase deficiency or decreased activity, abnormal regulation of p45oc17a, estrogen synthesis disorder, a large number of androgens converted to estrone in the periphery (fat, liver, kidney), also it is believed that the ovarian development is insufficient to decrease the activity of aromatase, the 2lh pulse frequency and amplitude increase, stimulate the formation of follicular cells and interstitial cells and androgen production, excessive androgen promotes follicular atresia, and early ovarian granulosa cells are yellowed. , growth stops, can not ovulate, form pcos.","['polycystic ovary', 'miscarriage', 'menstrual delay', 'no ovulation', 'dysmen', 'fat facial hair', 'follicle enlargement', 'amnesic amenorrhea', 'appearing throat knot']",['breast cancer'],"['gynecology and obstetrics', 'gynecology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

metabolic alkalosis,"metabolic alkalosis refers to a clinical syndrome in which the body loses too much acid or enters too much alkali from the body. the main biochemical manifestations are elevated blood hco3- and increased paco2.the ph value varies depending on the compensation situation and can be significantly too high; it can also be mildly elevated or even normal.the disease is often accompanied by hypokalemia. the primary cause of metabolic alkalosis is that the extracellular fluid loses a large amount of acid or absorbs a large amount of alkali, resulting in an increase in hco3-, thus [bhco3]/[hhco3] the larger the molecule causes the ph to rise.the main symptoms are finger, numbness, tingling, wrist and ankle and arrhythmia.but often covered by the primary disease.with low calcium, hand and foot convulsions may occur; with low potassium, polyuria, polydipsia and paralysis may occur; with low volume, postural vertigo and muscle weakness may occur.in severe cases, there may be confusion, unresponsiveness, and even paralysis.","early detection and early treatment are the key to prevention.the disease is usually secondary to other respiratory diseases, digestive systems, and blood system diseases.therefore, patients with these diseases should be treated aggressively, and while monitoring the primary disease, pay attention to monitoring the fluctuations of the internal environment.in particular, the use of some basic drugs such as sodium bicarbonate must be adequately indicated to avoid iatrogenic metabolic alkalosis caused by overuse.","the primary factor of metabolic alkalosis is that the extracellular fluid loses a large amount of h or absorbs a large amount of alkali, so that hco3- increases, and the molecular size of [bhco3]/[hhco3] increases, causing an increase in ph. 1, gastric juice loss, vomiting, long-term gastric aspiration, pyloric obstruction, after surgery anesthesia, can lose a lot of acidic gastric juice, resulting in excessive loss of h ions, the emergence of alkalosis. 2, low potassium, hypochloremia. extracellular fluid cl-, k+ decreased, such as decreased intake, or loss of gastric juice, or the use of furosemide, thiazide diuretics, loss of a large amount of cl- through the kidney, or absorption of cl- by congenital intestinal mucosal cells functional defects, etc., can reduce the extracellular fluid cl-. (1) when treating gastric ulcer disease, long-term use of a large amount of alkaline drugs reduces or eliminates gastric acid, so that the bicarbonate in the intestinal juice is absorbed into the blood without being neutralized, and the amount of hco3- in the blood increases greatly, thus occurring alkali poisoning. (2) excessive intake of organic acid salts, oral or injection of lactate, citrate (large amount of blood transfusion), when the acetate is too much, they are converted into co2 and h2o in the liver, and form bicarbonate, so that the content of hco3- in the blood is greatly increased, contributing to alkalosis. (3) a large amount of sodium bicarbonate is used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. after resuscitation, the lactate is metabolized and the consumed hco3- can be recovered. as a result, the hco3- in the blood is as high as 60-70 mmol/l, and the ph value is up to 7.90. in addition, in the case of renal failure, metabolic alkalosis can also occur if too much sodium bicarbonate is used.","['coma', 'toxic performance', 'drowsiness', 'low metabolism', 'dance-like hand-foot movement', 'maniac', 'irritability', 'no urine', 'tendon reflective advance', 'less pee']",['respiratory alkalosis'],['emergency department'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
metabolic acidosis,"metabolic acidosis is the most common acid-base balance disorder, which is caused by an increase in extracellular fluid h+ or loss of hco3- with a decrease in primary hco3- (<21mmol/l) and a decrease in ph (<7.35). feature.in the clinical judgment of metabolic acidosis, anion gap (ag) has important clinical value. according to different ag values, it can be divided into high ag normal chlorine type and normal ag high chlorine type metabolic acidosis.there is very little h in body fluids, mainly due to endogenous metabolism.the body has a fairly perfect adjustment mechanism for acid-base load, including buffering, compensation and corrective action.","the treatment of metabolic acidosis, remove the cause is the cure, supplementation is the palliative, so it should actively treat the primary disease, mild acidosis, can correct itself after correcting water shortage and electrolyte imbalance, do not need to make up, severe cases should be timely correct acidosis, in the process of supplementation, should pay attention to observe the clinical manifestations and review blood biochemistry, when the symptoms improve, urine volume is sufficient, co2cp18mmol / l or more, can not use alkaline drugs, metabolic acidosis, serum k + can be high, when correcting acidosis and lack of water, there may be low blood k +, hand and foot convulsions, should pay attention to supplement k +.","in the absence of oxygen, the glycolysis process is strengthened, the production of lactic acid is increased, and accumulation due to insufficient oxidation process leads to an increase in blood lactate level, which leads to acidosis. this acidosis is very common, and tissue hypoxia caused by various causes can be caused. ketoacidosis is a condition in which a large amount of body fat is used, such as diabetes, hunger, vomiting symptoms in a long-term pregnancy reaction, alcoholism and vomiting, and food intake in the liver for several days. ketone formation increases and exceeds the amount of extrahepatic utilization, resulting in ketosis. ketone bodies include acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, the latter two being organic acids, leading to metabolic acidosis. this acidosis is also an increase in normal blood chlorine metabolic acidosis. as diarrhea loses a lot of alkaline substances, it causes water, electrolyte and acid-base balance disorders. pathogenesis 1, buffering of blood and compensatory regulation of intracellular buffering. in metabolic acidosis, the increased h+ in the blood can be immediately buffered by the plasma buffer system. through the above reaction, plasma hco3- and buffer base are consumed. the generated h2co3 can be excreted by the lungs. the intracellular buffer is mostly caused by acidosis for 2 to 4 hours. the increased h+ in the extracellular fluid is transferred to the cells, which is buffered by the intracellular buffer base, and the intracellular k+ is transferred to the extracellular space. maintaining the internal and external electrical balance of the cells, so acidosis can easily cause hyperkalemia. 2, the lungs regulate the increase of blood h + concentration, stimulate the carotid body and aortic chemoreceptors, reflex induced respiratory center excitement, significantly increase lung ventilation, so that paco2 secondary reduction, maintain the ratio of hco3- / h2co3 close to normal, the blood ph value tends to normal, the compensatory response of breathing is very rapid, generally after 10 minutes of acidosis, respiratory enhancement occurs, after 30 minutes, the compensation is reached, 12 to 24 hours reaches the peak of compensation, and the maximum limit of compensation it is paco2 down to 10mmhg (1.33kpa). 3, kidney regulation in addition to metabolic acidosis caused by abnormal renal function, metabolic acidosis caused by other causes, the kidney exerts an important compensatory function through acid and alkali retention, and carbonic anhydrase activity in renal tubular epithelial cells increases during acidosis, promoting kidney small tube secretion of h+ and reabsorption of hco3- increased, phosphate acidification increased, but renal tubular secretion of nh4+ is the most important compensation mechanism, renal compensation generally exerts the maximum effect within 3 to 5 days, and potassium balance often occurs during acidosis. great influence, acidosis, early kidneys reduce k+ excretion, but then increase significantly, this is due to acidosis, blood potassium rise, stimulate aldosterone secretion and inhibit the reabsorption of hco3- in the proximal tubules, so that the distal tubules are reached. increase, so that the urinary potassium excretion increases.","['station in hospital', 'heart failure', 'diarrhea', 'low metabolism', 'ketoacidosis', 'abdominal pain', 'bradycardia', 'sinus fetal heart rate', 'disgusting', ' renal failure']",['high potassiumemia'],"['other departments', 'other synthesis']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

(2) according to the survey, in a bad family environment, such as parents often quarrel, contradictory or divorced families, the incidence of children's sleep disorders is high; improper family education, such as parents are simple and rude, strict constraints; parents inconsistent education methods, such as excessive protection, will make children mentally anxious, contradictory, and at a loss, and eventually become a major risk factor for children's sleep disorders.","['night horror', 'stationary doctor', 'pathological rem sleep', 'poor sleep is not good', 'tension fatigue', 'maintain sleep disorders insomnia', 'secondary insomnia', 'sleepwalking disease' ', 'baby sleep less', 'baby sleep is not practical', 'grinding teeth']",['children's anxiety disorder'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric synthesis']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
obesity,"obesity is a common, ancient group of metabolic disorders.when the body eats more calories than calories, the excess calories are stored in the body in the form of fat, which exceeds the normal physiological requirements, and when it reaches a certain value, it becomes obesity.an increase in body fat such that body weight exceeds 20% of standard body weight or body mass index [bmi = body weight (k) / height (m) 2] greater than 24 is called obesity.if there is no obvious cause, it can be called simple obesity, and those with a clear cause are called secondary obesity.","obesity should be based on prevention. people should be aware of their risks and keep their weight as normal as possible. prevention of obesity should start from childhood.at present, obesity is understood as ""a normal physiological process in a pathological environment.""the main reason for the increase in the prevalence of obesity is the environment, not the ※pathological§ effect of metabolic defects or the mutation of individual genes. since the factors of the remains are immutable, it is necessary to regulate lifestyle, that is, a reasonable diet and appropriate physical activity. to control the rise in weight.based on this new concept, governments are committed to promoting healthy lifestyles and universal prevention programs. in general, there are three preventive measures, namely universal prevention, selective prevention ((#sel#)ive prevention) and targeted prevention (target prevention). universal prevention: targeting the population as a whole, stabilizing obesity levels and ultimately reducing the incidence of obesity and reducing the prevalence of obesity, changing lifestyles by improving dietary structure and promoting appropriate physical activity and reducing smoking and drinking, ultimately reduce obesity-related diseases and achieve universal prevention. selective prevention: designed to educate people at high risk of obesity so that they can fight powerfully with risk factors.these risk factors may come from heredity, making them vulnerable to obesity. the measures taken are for places that are easily accessible to high-risk groups, such as schools, community centers, and primary prevention sites, starting with education and specific interventions, the singapore ministry of education's adoption of this preventive measure for children has reduced the prevalence of obesity from 15% to 12.5%.","epidemiological surveys have shown that some of the simple obesity have a family predisposition. both parents are obese, and those who are born with simple obesity are 5 to 8 times more likely than those born to both parents. vanllallie conducted a longitudinal survey of 1,333 children born between 1965 and 1970 and found that one parent was obese, and their children's children's odds increased with age. obese children aged 1 to 2 years old are 1.3 in early adult obesity, 4.7 in 3 to 5 years old, 8.8 in 6 to 9 years old, 22.3 in 10 to 14 years old, and 17.5 in 15 to 17 years old. it is known that there are two pairs of nerve nuclei related to feeding behavior in the hypothalamus of humans and various animals. one pair is the contralateral contralateral nucleus (vmh), also known as the satiety center; the other pair is the ventrolateral nucleus (lha). also known as the hunger center, when the center is full of excitement, there is a feeling of fullness and refusal to eat. when it is destroyed, the appetite is greatly increased. when the hunger center is excited, the appetite is strong, and when it is destroyed, it is anorexia and antifeeding. the two regulate each other, restrict each other, and are in dynamic balance under physiological conditions. state, which regulates appetite to the normal range and maintains normal body weight. when the hypothalamus develops lesions, whether it is a sequela of inflammation (such as meningitis, encephalitis), trauma, tumors and other pathological changes, such as ventral medial nucleus destruction, the ventrolateral nucleus function is relatively phlegm and then gluttony, causing obesity; conversely, when the ventrolateral nucleus is destroyed, the ventromedial nucleus functions relatively sputum and then anorexia, causing weight loss. in addition, the area has a close anatomical connection with higher-grade neural tissue, which can also regulate the feeding center to a certain extent. the blood-brain barrier at the hypothalamus is relatively weak. this anatomical feature makes it easy for many biologically active factors in the blood to migrate to the place, thus affecting the feeding behavior. these factors include: glucose, free fatty acids, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, insulin, and the like. in addition, mental factors often affect appetite, and the function of the prey center is controlled by mental state. when mental stress is excessive and sympathetic stimulation or adrenergic nerve stimulation (especially 汐 receptor predominance), appetite is inhibited; when vagus nerve is excited when insulin secretion increases, appetite often increases. the ventromedial nucleus is the sympathetic center, and the ventrolateral nucleus is the parasympathetic center. both play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. in recent years, the role of hyperinsulinemia in the pathogenesis of obesity has attracted attention. obesity often coexists with hyperinsulinemia, but it is generally believed that hyperinsulinemia causes obesity.the insulin release of hyperinsulinemia obese people is about three times that of normal people, and insulin has a significant effect on promoting fat accumulation.some people think that insulin can be used as an indicator of total lipid content, and in a certain sense can be used as a monitoring factor for obesity; it is also believed that plasma insulin concentration is significantly positively correlated with total lipid content. brown adipose tissue is an adipose tissue that has been discovered in recent years and corresponds to white adipose tissue that is mainly distributed under the skin and around the internal organs.the distribution of brown adipose tissue is limited, and it is only distributed between the scapula, the neck and back, the armpit, the mediastinum and the kidney. the tissue appearance is light brown and the cell volume changes relatively little.white adipose tissue is a form of energy storage. the body stores excess energy in the form of neutral fat. when the body needs energy, the neutral fat is hydrolyzed in the fat cells. the volume of white fat cells changes with the release energy and storage energy. big.brown adipose tissue is functionally a thermogenic organ, that is, when the body is ingested or stimulated by cold, the fat in the brown fat cells burns, thereby determining the energy metabolism level of the body.the above two conditions are called feeding-induced heat production and cold-induced heat production.of course, the function of this special protein is affected by many factors. it can be seen that the brown adipose tissue is directly involved in the total regulation of heat in the body, and the excess heat in the body is released to the outside of the body, so that the body's energy metabolism tends to balance. .","['resident medicine', 'sleepiness', 'male type obesity', 'visceral obesity', 'female type obesity', 'pubertal obesity', 'fat metabolism disorder', 'sugar metabolism disorder', 'secondary obesity']",['polycystic ovary syndrome'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic coma,"hyperosmolar coma (hndc) is a rare and severe acute complication of diabetes. it is more common in elderly patients with no diabetes or non-insulin-dependent diabetes, but it can also be seen in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes.the patient's original insulin secretion is insufficient, and the blood sugar rises sharply under the inducement, which promotes the disorder of glucose metabolism, resulting in hyperosmotic state of extracellular fluid, hypovolemic hyperosmolar dehydration, and insufficient cerebral cortical blood supply and deficiency. oxygen, causing mental symptoms and coma.","the prevention of hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic coma is extremely important, because once the patient is ill, it will pose a great threat to his life. in general, the following measures are needed to prevent this disease: 1.to detect and correctly treat diabetes in a timely manner, it is necessary to improve the vigilance of diabetes, and often conduct self-monitoring. once you find that you have diabetes, you should actively treat it. 2.diabetes patients should pay attention to reasonable living arrangements, exercise properly, do not overwork, especially pay attention to drinking water, many people with diabetes are afraid of drinking water because of excessive urine, thinking that most of the urine is caused by drinking water, which is actually a kind of misunderstanding, the reason why people with diabetes are mostly because their blood sugar is too high, their urine sugar concentration and urine osmotic pressure also rise, so that the reabsorption of renal tubules can not proceed normally, resulting in increased urine output, and this is related to patients. the amount of drinking water is not directly related. after the urine increases, the amount of water in the body will decrease, and the blood volume will also decrease. after the blood is concentrated, the blood sugar will also increase relatively. if the water is not replenished in time, there will be a vicious circle, which will lead to hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma. therefore, diabetic patients should not deliberately control the amount of water (especially those with polyuria), regardless of whether they have thirst or not, the amount of water per day. it should not be less than 2500 ml. 3.older people suffering from colds, urinary tract infections, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and other diseases must be treated promptly, and avoid the use of certain drugs that can cause hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic coma, such as glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, thiazide diuretics and beta blockers, etc.","one.stress: such as infection (especially respiratory and urinary tract infections), trauma, surgery, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, acute pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, heatstroke or hypothermia. two.insufficient water intake: an important factor in induction. three.excessive water loss: seen in severe vomiting, diarrhea, and large areas of burn patients. four.high sugar intake. fives.drugs: including a variety of glucocorticoids, diuretics, phenytoin, hibernation, propranolol, cimetidine, immunosuppressive agents, azathioprine and glycerol.","['coma', 'blood pressure drop', 'drowsiness', 'polydipsia and polydipsia', 'more drink', 'consciousness disorder', 'breathing can have rotten apple flavor', 'dehydration', 'multiple urine', 'diabetes']",['renal failure'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hyperlipidemia,"hyperlipidemia refers to high blood lipid levels, which can directly cause diseases that seriously endanger human health, such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and pancreatitis.due to fat metabolism or abnormal operation, one or more lipids in plasma are higher than normal called hyperlipidemia. lipid insoluble or slightly soluble in water must be combined with protein to exist in the form of lipoprotein. therefore, hyperlipidemia often occurs. it is hyperlipoproteinemia, which is characterized by hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.","daily prevention ofhyperlipidemia, obesity of people over 45 years of age , regular family history of hyperlipidemia, frequent participation in entertainment, and high mental stress are all high-risk groups. it is recommended to check blood lipids once a year. 2, the most fundamental purpose ofdrug regulation andlipid-lowering therapy is to prevent the occurrence of coronary heart disease, stroke and other diseases.when the blood lipids are not reduced to the desired level by rationally adjusting the diet structure, changing bad habits, and strengthening physical exercise, it is necessary to treat with drugs. the treatment of hyperlipidemia must be taken for a long time. health education first, establish good living habits, quit smoking, stop drinking, strengthen physical exercise, choose light and moderate sports activities suitable for my own, work and rest, relieve all kinds of ideological concerns, feel comfortable, and maintain health. the second is to use diet therapy to limit the excessive intake of high-cholesterol foods, such as animal fat, animal brain, internal organs, cream, soft body, shellfish intake, diet structure should be rationally allocated, the proportion of protein is 15%, 20% fat, 65% carbohydrates (sugar), supplemented with high-quality protein, eat fresh vegetables and eat appropriate fruits, eat more eggplant, onions, hawthorn, tomatoes, soy products, soybeans, corn, walnuts and milk and so on.","blood lipids mainly include cholesterol (or total cholesterol tc) and triglycerides, which exist in a non-free state in the blood circulation, and protein transports into a macromolecular transport such as lipoproteins. the main lipoprotein classification - chylomicrons, very low density (pre-beta) lipoprotein (vldl), low density (汕-) lipoprotein (ldl), and high density (a-) lipoprotein (hdl) -- these proteins are closely related, and often in terms of physicochemical properties (such as electrophoretic mobility and density after ultracentrifugation), the major lipoproteins in the blood are transported to triglycerides, which are the largest lipoprotein carriers, and exogenous triglycerides from the thoracic duct to the venous system, in fat capillaries and muscle tissue, 90% of the chylomicron is transported through a specific group of esterases, and the chylomicrons are hydrolyzed into fatty acids and glycerol into the fat cells and muscle cells. utilization or storage, this lipase rapidly degrades endogenous triglycerides in vldl, causing loss of triglyceride and apoprotein in medium density lipoprotein (idl), and separation of idl by 2 to 6 hours. triglyceride and further degrade into ldthe half-life of l, ldl in plasma is 2 to 3 days, and vldl is the main source of plasma ldl. excessive or clearing disorder caused by vldl and excessive conversion of vldl into ldl. obesity, diabetes, alcohol overdose, nephrotic syndrome or genetic defects can cause excessive production of vldl in the liver, and ldl and tc are also often associated with high blood triglycerides. ester-associated, ldl clearance disorder is associated with structural defects in apob. in addition, clearance disorders may also be due to decreased ldl receptor number or dysfunction (reduced viability), which may be due to genetic or dietary factors, ldl receptor protein structure molecular defects are a common genetic cause of ldl receptor dysfunction - a common mechanism of gene defects is described below.","['acute lower limb ischemia', 'arrhythmia abnormality', 'severe obesity', 'fat lines', 'atherosclerosis', 'serum hdl-c...', 'hand cramps', 'diabetes'",['fatty liver'],"['internal medicine', 'cardiology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
osteoporosis,"osteoporosis (osteoporosis) is a systemic bone disease characterized by decreased bone mass and microstructural destruction of the bone, manifested by increased fragility of the bone, and thus the risk of fracture is greatly increased, even for minor trauma or fractures are also prone to occur without trauma.osteoporosis is a chronic disease caused by multiple factors.there is usually no special clinical manifestation before the fracture occurs.more women than men, common in postmenopausal women and the elderly.","osteoporosis brings great inconvenience and pain to patients' lives. the treatment results are very slow. once the fracture is life-threatening, special emphasis should be placed on the implementation of tertiary prevention: primary prevention: starting from children and adolescents, such as pay attention to reasonable dietary nutrition, eat more foods containing high ca, p, such as fish, shrimp, shrimp skin, kelp, milk (250ml containing ca300mg), dairy products, bone soup, eggs, beans, grains, sesame seeds, seeds, green leaves vegetables, try to get rid of the ""risk factor"", adhere to the scientific lifestyle, such as insisting on physical exercise, more sunbathing, no smoking, no drinking, less coffee, strong tea and carbonated drinks, less sugar and salt, animal protein should not be too much, late marriage, less fertility, lactation should not be too long, as much as possible to preserve calcium in the body, enrich the calcium pool, increase the peak of bone to the maximum is the best measure to prevent osteoporosis in later life, strengthen bone loose basic research, focus on high-risk groups with genetics, early prevention and treatment. secondary prevention: when people reach middle age, especially after menopause, bone loss is accelerated. during this period, bone mineral density examination should be carried out once a year. for people with rapid bone mass reduction, prevention and treatment should be taken early. most scholars in europe and america in recent years. it advocates long-term estrogen replacement therapy within 3 years after menopause, and insists on long-term preventive calcium supplementation to prevent osteoporosis safely and effectively. japan advocates the use of active vitd and calcium to prevent bone mass. loose, pay attention to active treatment of osteoporosis-related diseases, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, steatorrhea, chronic nephritis, hyperparathyroidism / hyperthyroidism, bone metastases, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis. tertiary prevention: for patients with degenerative osteoporosis, drug treatment should be actively suppressed to inhibit bone resorption (estrogen, ct, ca) and promote bone formation (active vit d). anti-fall, anti-collision and anti-mite should also be strengthened. measures such as anti-bumping, active surgery for middle-aged and elderly patients with fractures, strong internal fixation, early activities, physical therapy, physical therapy psychology, nutrition, calcium supplementation, pain relief, bone growth, bone loss, immune function and overall quality such as comprehensive treatment.","female patients suffer from osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency, and men are caused by decreased testosterone levels due to sexual dysfunction. osteoporosis is particularly common in postmenopausal women. premature ovarian failure causes osteoporosis to appear prematurely, suggesting estrogen reduction is an important factor in the occurrence of osteoporosis. there will be a sudden and significant acceleration of bone loss in 5 years after menopause. it is common to lose 2% to 5% of bone loss every year. about 20% to 30% of early menopausal women lose bone mass. >3%/year, known as rapid bone loss, and 70% to 80% of women lose bone bone loss <3%/year, called normal bone loss, thin women are more prone to osteoporosis than fat women it is easy to fracture, which is the result of the conversion of androgen into estrogen in the fat tissue of the latter. compared with normal women of similar age, there is no significant difference in blood estrogen levels in patients with osteoporosis, indicating that estrogen reduction is not it is the only factor that causes osteoporosis. osteoporosis is more common in whites, especially in nordic countries, followed by asians, while blacks are rare. bone mineral density is an important indicator for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. bone mineral density is mainly determined by genetic factors, followed by environmental factors. it has been reported that the difference in bone mineral density between young twins is four times that between single-oval twins; while the difference in bone mineral density between adult twins is 19 times that of single-oval twins, recent studies indicate bone mineral density is closely related to the polymorphism of vitamin d receptor genotype. in 1994, morrison et al reported that the vitamin d receptor genotype can predict the difference in bone mineral density, which can account for 75% of the entire genetic impact, after various environmental factors. after adjustment, the bone density of bb genotypes can be about 15% higher than that of bb genotypes. in the incidence of vertebral fractures, bb genotypes can be about 10 years later than bb, and the incidence of hip fractures. on the top, bb gene walkers are only 1/4 of the bb type. the results of this study have initially shown that there are great differences among different races and countries. the final results still need further study. others such as collagen gene and estrogen are affected. the relationship between genes and osteoporosis have also been reported, but there is no definite conclusion. calcium intake in adolescents has been found to be directly related to bone mass peaks in adulthood. calcium deficiency leads to increased pth secretion and bone resorption. low-calcium diets are prone to osteoporosis, and vitamin d deficiency leads to mineralization of bone matrix. impaired, osteomalacia can occur, long-term protein deficiency leads to insufficient synthesis of bone machinery protein, leading to backward new bone formation, such as calcium deficiency, osteoporosis is accelerated, vitamin c is the synthesis of bone matrix hydroxyproline indispensable, it can maintain the normal growth of the bone matrix and maintain the bone cells to produce a sufficient amount of alkaline phosphatase, such as the lack of vitamin c can reduce bone matrix synthesis. the muscle exerts mechanical force on the bone tissue. if the muscular bone is strong, the bone density is high. because the activity of the elderly is reduced, the muscle strength is weakened, the mechanical stimulation is less, the bone mass is reduced, and the muscle strength is weakened and the coordination disorder makes the elderly. people are more likely to wrestle, and are prone to fractures when the bone mass is reduced. the elderly suffer from long-term bed rest after a moderate stroke, and bone loss is caused by disuse factors, which is prone to osteoporosis.","['bone metabolism reduction', 'thoracic and lumbar vertebral compression fracture', 'spinal bone change', 'humpback', 'bone pain', 'female low back pain', 'incisor widening', 'mildile tendon pain', 'long limbs and muscles of the limbs...', 'diffuse osteoporosis']",['fracture'],"['surgery', 'orthopaedic surgery']","['supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
graves disease,"toxic diffuse goiter is an autoimmune disease. the clinical manifestations are not limited to the thyroid gland, but a multi-system syndrome, including: high metabolic syndrome, diffuse goiter, eye signs, skin lesions and thyroid limbs. end disease, because most patients have high metabolic syndrome and thyroid enlargement, it is called toxic diffuse goiter, also known as graves disease. in addition to thyroid, invasive endocrine exophthalmos can exist alone without hypermetabolism. .","professional guidance 1. prevention of disease first: emotional factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism. ""ji shengfang. the treatment of tumors"" said: ""the tumors are mostly irritated and overly worried. cheng si disease, ""so, prevent hyperthyroidism, we should first maintain a happy spirit in daily life. comfortable mood, followed by reasonable diet to avoid irritating food, is also an important preventive measure; at the same time living regulations, do not work hard; help the spleen and stomach it is important to enhance physical fitness and improve immunity and disease resistance. 2. disease prevention and prevention: prevention of disease is the most ideal prevention, but if hyperthyroidism has occurred, it should be diagnosed early and treated early to prevent the disease from changing, that is, to prevent the development of the disease and the occurrence of complications. ""su wen. jade machine true tibetan articles"" cloud: ""the five internal organs are connected, the movements are all secondary, the five internal organs are sick, then each pass its victory,"" therefore, according to the law of the occurrence of complications of hyperthyroidism, take preventive measures to prevent the occurrence of complications and control the transformation of the disease. 3. after the anti-recurrence: as the saying goes: ""the disease is like a mountain, the disease is like a silk,"" the image of the metaphor after the body has a state to be restored, there is a recovery of the fluid loss of the body. be cautious, the original condition may be delayed and re-integrated. therefore, in the initial stage, drugs, diet, spiritual medicated diet, etc. should be comprehensively conditioned, and regular inspections and careful monitoring are important measures to prevent recurrence after illness.","the disease has been confirmed to be an autoimmune disease, but its pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. one of its characteristics is the presence of autoantibodies in the serum that can react or stimulate the thyroid tissue. this antibody can stimulate rodents. the thyroid gland, which enhances its function and causes tissue hyperplasia, but its action is slow and long-lasting, so it was originally called the long-acting thyroid stimulating kiss (lats). later, due to different methods, there may be other names such as human thyroid stimulating hormone. (hts), lats protectant (latsp), tsh replacement active (tda), thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (tsi) or thyroid stimulating antibody (tsab), collectively referred to as tsh receptor antibody (tsab), is the lymph node of this disease the igg secreted by the cell, whose corresponding antigen is the tsh receptor or the part adjacent to the serosal surface of the thyroid cell. when tsi binds to the thyroid cell, the tsh receptor is activated, so that the function of the thyroid is stimulated, causing hyperthyroidism and goiter. its role is similar to that of tsh. it is believed that the production of autoantibodies is mainly related to the inhibitory t lymphocyte (ts) function associated with the underlying defects. low, ts function deficiency leads to inappropriate sensitization of helper t cells, and b cells produce anti-self thyroid antibodies with the participation of interleukin 1 and interleukin 2, in addition, the leukocyte cell migration inhibition test for thyroid tissue is positive in this disease. the reaction, thyroid and post-balloon tissue have obvious lymphocytic infiltration, indicating that cell-mediated immunity is involved. individual immunological monitoring defects, can not explain some specific immune diseases, but also need to be linked to the idiotype cascade mechanism, the variable regions of heavy and light chains in immunoglobulin molecules have antigenic determinants, according to the region the sequence of the amino acid determines the specificity of the antibody, and the variable of different specificity has different antigenic determinants or genotype determinants. for example, rabbits are immunized with monoclonal human myeloma protein, and the obtained antiserum can be combined with myeloma immunoglobulin. the structure of the variable region of the protein is specifically bound. these structures are called genotypes. the application of the idiotype/antiidiotype principle can be extended to explain the formation of receptor antibodies in diseases such as graves disease and myasthenia gravis. for example, in myasthenia gravis, the ligand (acetylcholine) binds to the cell surface receptor and its corresponding antibody (anti-acetylcholine, ie genotype), and thus the receptor and antibody have the same structure that can bind to the ligand, in addition, farid et al. immunized rabbits with anti-human tsh antibodies to obtain anti-genotype antibodies, which in the thyroid culture cells can bind to tsh receptors. it can stimulate the synthesis of camp, which acts as if it is graves' disease lats or tsab. the self-anti-tsh receptor antibody (trab) in graves disease is a group of polyclonal antibodies acting at different binding sites of tsh receptors. trab can be divided into excitatory and closed type, and one type of excitatory type and ths receptor. after binding, it promotes the synthesis and release of thyroxine into the blood, and the thyroid cells are also stimulated and proliferated, called tsab, which is the main autoantibody in graves' disease. the other type, when combined with tsh receptor, only promotes thyroid cell enlargement, but does not cause the synthesis and release of hormones, called thyroid cell enlargement, but does not cause the synthesis and release of hormones, called thyroid growth immunoglobulin (tgi), blocking autoantibodies and tsh after full binding, blocking and inhibition thyroid function, called thyroid function inhibitory antibody (tfiab) and thyroid growth blocking antibody (tgrab), a small number of patients with graves disease have obvious hypermetabolic disease, but the goiter is very mild, probably due to excitatory antibodies in vivo, trab predominates caused. the autoimmune monitoring defects are controlled by genetic genes. the disease has obvious family aggregation. the consistency of the same egg in the children with hyperthyroidism is 50%. the disease is related to some histocompatibility complex (mhc). for example, dr4 antigen or hla-b8, b46, etc., mental factors, such as trauma, anger is an important predisposing factor, which can lead to decompensation of ts cell population and also promote cytotoxicity.","['gynecologic enlargement', 'vascular murmur', 'gothmeg', 'hyperhidrosis', 'his cold fear of heat', 'wasting', 'anorexia']",['hyperthyroidism'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment']"

respiratory alkalosis,"respiratory alkalosis refers to a decrease in plasma h2co3 concentration or paco2 due to excessive pulmonary ventilation, resulting in an increase in ph (>7.45).according to the incidence of the disease is also divided into two major categories of acute and chronic.in the acute case, the paco2 decreased by 10 mmhg (1.3 kpa), the hc03- decreased by about 2 mmol/l, and the chronic hco3- decreased to 4-5 mmol/l.respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a decrease in blood paco2 and an increase in ph, also known as hypocapnia.the main reason is excessive ventilation of the lungs, and the body loses too much co2.can be seen in shock, high fever, craniocerebral injury, recall disease.","the best measure for prevention is to actively deal with the primary disease, cover the nose and mouth with paper bags, increase the dead space of the respiratory tract, reduce the exhalation and loss of co2, increase the blood pco2, and inhale the oxygen containing 5% co2. excessive ventilation caused by improper use of the ventilator should be adjusted. the intravenous injection of calcium gluconate can eliminate hand and foot convulsions.","when hyperthyroidism and fever occur, ventilation can significantly increase beyond the amount of co2 that should be expelled, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis, but it is generally not serious, but it indicates that the ventilation is not solely dependent on [h+] and pco2 in body fluids. it is also related to metabolic intensity and aerobic conditions. at this time, hyperventilation may be caused by an increase in pulmonary blood flow through a reflective reaction. hyperventilation during hypoxic hypoxia is a compensation for hypoxia, but at the same time it can cause excessive co2 emission and respiratory alkalosis, which is common in people who enter the plateau, mountains or high altitude; thoracic and lung lesions such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary congestion, etc. cause thoracic, pulmonary vascular or lung tissue afferent nerve stimulation and increased reflex ventilation; in addition, some patients with congenital heart disease, due to increased right-to-left shunt caused by low-tension hypoxemia can also cause hyperventilation, which causes a decrease in plasma h2co3 and respiratory alkalosis. there is a moderate increase in ventilation, which exceeds co2 production. it is currently believed to be a stimulating effect of progesterone on the respiratory center. some synthetic progesterone preparations also have this effect. during pregnancy, vomiting may occur due to vomiting and insufficient diet. respiratory alkalosis can occur after the pregnancy reaction period, sometimes causing hand and foot spasms. respiratory acidosis caused by airway obstruction may have obtained a considerable degree of compensation after more than 6-8 hours. the plasma hco3- has increased correspondingly, and it has a proper ratio with the accumulated co2. if the cause of obstruction of the respiratory tract is suddenly except, a large amount of co2 is exhaled from the lungs, and the arterial blood pco2 suddenly decreases. the already increased hco3- has not yet been released through the kidneys, so the proportion of [bhco3]/[hhco3] suddenly increases, and alkalosis occurs in sputum. respiratory acidosis for excessive compensation, but its essence is due to the sudden decrease in pco2 causing an increase in blood ph, which is still a category of respiratory alkalosis.","['metabolic alkalosis', 'stationary doctor', 'chest pain', 'respiratory alkalosis', 'chest tightness', 'over-ventilation syndrome', 'dizziness', 'twitching']",['acute respiratory distress syndrome'],"['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
respiratory acidosis,"respiratory acidosis refers to a clinical syndrome in which the increase in paco2 caused by various causes leads to a decrease in ph.clinically, the disease can exist alone or in combination with other acid-base balance disorders.according to the speed of onset, it can be divided into two categories: acute respiratory acidosis and chronic respiratory acidosis.the main reason is the reduction of ventilation function of the lung; it can be seen in respiratory obstruction, pneumonia, atelectasis, chest and abdomen surgery, trauma and so on.the fundamental method of treatment is to relieve the airway obstruction, increase the driving force of the respiratory center, and improve the function of lung ventilation.","respiratory acidosis, mainly seen in traumatic brain injury, respiratory obstruction and chest surgery or trauma, treatment to relieve airway obstruction, improve lung ventilation, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and other medical diseases cause respiratory insufficiency, respiratory acidosis is more common, suggesting that airflow is limited or that there is insufficient lung ventilation, and changes in arterial blood gas need to be detected.","some central nervous system diseases such as cerebral neoplasms, cerebral poliomyelitis, encephalitis, meningitis, vertebral artery embolism or thrombosis, increased intracranial pressure, traumatic brain injury, etc., respiratory center activity can be inhibited, reduce ventilation and accumulate co2.in addition, some drugs such as anesthetics, sedatives (morphine, sodium barbital, etc.) have the effect of inhibiting breathing, too much dose can also cause hypoventilation.carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide inhibit carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells and reduce the release of co2 from red blood cells in the lungs, causing an increase in arterial blood pco2.those who have a tendency to acidosis should use this medicine with caution. found in poliomyelitis, acute infectious polyneuritis (guillain-barre syndrome), botulism, myasthenia gravis, hypokalemia or familial periodic paralysis, high spinal cord injury.in severe cases, the respiratory muscles can be paralyzed.common thoracic abnormalities affecting respiratory movement include posterior spine, scoliosis, flail chest, ankylosing spondylitis, and cardiopulmonary obesity syndrome (picwick syndrome). it is the most common cause of respiratory acidosis.it includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, severe interstitial lung disease, sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome, and primary hypoventilation syndrome.these lesions can seriously impede alveolar ventilation.excessive co2 inhalation means that the concentration of co2 in the inhaled gas is too high, such as in a narrow space with poor ventilation and such as tunnels and tanks.at this time, the alveolar ventilation did not decrease.","['metabolic alkalosis', 'coma', 'stationary doctor', 'respiratory failure', 'sleepiness', 'woody stiffness', 'qi short', 'twitching', 'increased intracranial pressure', 'metabolic acidosis']","['metabolic acidosis', 'sepsis', 'metabolic alkalosis', 'hyperkalemia']","['internal medicine', 'respiratory medicine']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hypothyroidism,"hypothyroidism (referred to as hypothyroidism) is a disease in which the body's metabolism is reduced due to reduced synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones or insufficient physiological effects.according to its etiology, it was divided into primary hypothyroidism, secondary hypothyroidism and peripheral hypothyroidism. if the decline in function begins in the fetus or neonatal period, it is called cretinism; the child who begins with sexual development is called juvenile hypothyroidism; the adult begins with adult type hypothyroidism. female hypothyroidism is more common than in men, and its prevalence increases with age. the incidence of neonatal hypothyroidism is about 1 in 7000. the incidence of hypothyroidism in adolescents is reduced. after adulthood, it is seen to increase. the cause of hypothyroidism is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.","(1) causes of hypothyroidism prevention: 1.preventionof the cause of dysplasia: endemic stagnation, iodine deficiency in pregnant women during embryonic period is the key to the onset of disease, sporadic stagnation, and some of the pregnant women themselves caused by immune thyroid disease, clear cause of prevention, anti-thyroid drugs in the mother's pregnancy to avoid excessive doses, the use of small doses of dry thyroid preparations, and to avoid other drugs that cause goiter. 2, the prevention of hypothyroidism in adults: timely treatment of thyroid disease that is easy to cause hypothyroidism, prevent hand surgery for thyroid disease or radioactive 131 iodine treatment of hyperthyroidism caused by hyperthyroidism.

cushing syndrome,"cushingssyndrome, also known as hvpercortisolism or cushing's syndrome, was first reported by harvey cushing in 1912.intrinsic is a clinical syndrome characterized by hypercortisolemia caused by a variety of causes, mainly characterized by full moon face, multi-blood appearance, centripetal obesity, hemorrhoids, purple streaks, hypertension, secondary diabetes and osteoporosis and so on.the clinical manifestations of typical cushing's syndrome are mainly due to the long-term excessive secretion of cortisol, which causes serious disturbance of protein, fat, sugar and electrolyte metabolism and interferes with the secretion of various other hormones.in addition, excessive secretion of acth and excessive secretion of other adrenocortical hormones may also cause corresponding clinical manifestations.","early diagnosis, early treatment, prevention of complications. [health guidance] 1. instruct patients in daily life, pay attention to prevent infection, keep skin clean, prevent trauma and fracture. 2. instruct patients to correctly take a balanced diet and give low sodium, high potassium, and high protein foods. 3, take the medicine according to the doctor's advice, do not arbitrarily reduce the medicine or stop the medicine. 4. regular outpatient follow-up.","long-term use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of certain diseases can lead to clinical manifestations of cortisol, which is very common in the clinic, which is caused by exogenous hormones, which can be gradually restored after stopping the drug, but long-term use of glucocorticoids feedback inhibits the secretion of acth from the pituitary gland, causing atrophy of the adrenal cortex. once the drug is stopped, it may lead to a series of manifestations of cortical dysfunction and even crisis. therefore, it should be noted that long-term use of acth can also cause cortisol. bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is caused by excessive secretion of acth in the pituitary gland. the causes are: 1 pituitary tumor, more common basophilic tumor, also seen in chromoblastoma; 2 pituitary no obvious tumor, but increased secretion of acth, generally considered to be due to excessive secretion of corticotropin releasing factor (crf) in the hypothalamus, only about 10% of pituitary tumors can be found clinically. in this case, plasma cortisol has reached an abnormally high level due to pituitary secretion of acth. the increase is not sufficient to cause normal feedback inhibition, but oral high-dose dexamethasone can still have an inhibitory effect. bronchial lung cancer (especially oat cell carcinoma), thyroid cancer, thymic cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and tumors originating from neural crest tissue sometimes secrete an acth-like substance with a biological effect similar to acth, causing bilateral adrenal cortex hyperplasia, so called heterologous acth syndrome, these patients also often have obvious muscle atrophy and hypokalemia, the secretion of acth substances in the lesion is autonomous, oral high-dose dexamethasone no inhibition, lesion resection or cure after that, the illness gradually subsided. mostly benign adrenal adenomas, a small number of malignant adenocarcinomas, tumor growth and secretion of adrenocortical hormone is autonomous, not controlled by acth, due to the secretion of a large number of corticosteroids, feedback inhibits the secretion of pituitary function, so that the concentration of plasma acth is reduced, so that the normal adrenal cortex of the non-tumor part is obviously atrophied. in such patients, whether acth is excited or high-dose dexamethasone is inhibited, the amount of cortisol secretion will not change, and adrenal cortical tumors are especially in malignant tumors, 17 ketosteroids in urine are often significantly increased. adrenal cortical tumors are mostly single benign adenomas, generally less than 3 to 4 cm in diameter, with brownish-yellow color and intact capsule. the morphology and arrangement of tumor cells are similar to those of adrenal cortical cells. adenocarcinoma is often large, fishy and infiltrating. or spread to the surrounding organs, often with lymph nodes and distant metastasis, the cells are characterized by malignant cells, and adrenal cortical tumors without endocrine function do not cause cortisol. clinically, a few cases of nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal gland are found to be an intermediate type of hyperplasia and adenoma. the plasma acth can be decreased, and the high-dose dexamethasone has no inhibitory effect. according to statistics, 70% of clinical cases are bilateral adrenal hyperplasia caused by pituitary lesions, benign adenomas account for 20-30%, malignant adrenal adenocarcinomas account for 5-10%, and excessive ectopic acth secretion is rare. . pathogenesis 1. primary adrenal cortical lesions are primary tumors of the adrenal gland. cortical adenomas account for about 20% of adult cushing's syndrome, and cortical adenocarcinomas account for about 5%. in children, more than 50% of adenomas are malignant, adrenal tumors have autonomic growth and secretion function, and are not controlled by acth secreted by pituitary gland. therefore, they are not acth-dependent. because of the excessive secretion of cortisol from the tumor, feedback inhibits the release of pituitary acth in the blood of patients. the acth is so low that the adrenal cortex is atrophied on the contralateral and ipsilateral tumors. the adenocarcinoma is generally large and grows rapidly. in addition to secreting too much cortisol, it also secretes other corticosteroids (aldosterone) and adrenal androgens; cancer patients may have 11汕-hydroxylase involvement, and the 17-ketosteroid (17-ks) in the urine of patients is significantly increased. patients with adrenal adenocarcinoma have mutations in the p53 gene on the long arm of chromosome 17, and the p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene, which can play an immune surveillance role, allows the body to clear the mutant cell line in time, and when the p53 gene is mutated or deleted, the immune surveillance effect is lost, and the mutant cell line can infinitely multiply and produce adrenal skin.malignant tumors, benign tumors in the adrenal glands, found no problems p53 gene, it is not yet clear mechanism for benign tumors. some experts believe that the nature of the tumor is related to the defect of the short arm of chromosome 11; most malignant tumors have a short arm defect of chromosome 11, which can lead to overexpression of igfii and excessive growth of atypical cells. 2, pituitary tumor or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction secondary to pituitary tumor or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, called cushing's disease, accounting for about 70% of adult cushing's syndrome, due to pituitary tumor or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, excessive secretion of acth, stimulation of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, can cause excessive secretion of cortisol, it is acth-dependent.","['back pain', 'long-term use of glucocor...', 'osteoporosis', 'masculine', 'hypokalemia', 'multiple blood quality', 'amnestic amenorrhea', 'muscle atrophy']","['kidney stones', 'hypertension', 'cerebral arteriosclerosis', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']","['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis,"chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (clt), also known as autoimmune thyroiditis, is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease with its own thyroid tissue as an antigen.japan's kyushu university hashimoto first (1912) reported four cases in the german medical journal and named hashimoto (hashimotosthyroiditis, ht), the most common thyroid inflammation in the clinic.in recent years, the incidence rate has increased rapidly. it has been reported that it has similar morbidity to hyperthyroidism. this disease is the most common cause of goiter and acquired hypothyroidism in children and adolescents.","it is an autoimmune disease with no special precautions.long-term use of thyroxine after surgery can reduce the incidence of hypothyroidism, and at the same time continue to treat hashimoto's disease, especially in patients who have more thyroid tissue removed during surgery. this group of patients are given oral replacement therapy with levothyroxine tablets after surgery. 50mg / d as the starting dose, according to the review of ft3, ft4, tsh results gradually adjust the amount of thyroxine tablets until the maintenance amount, and as long as possible to take the drug time or lifelong medication, the group has complete follow-up data, follow-up for more than 3 years of thyroid hormone the average control was within the normal range, and no hypothyroidism occurred.","it has become a consensus that clt is produced by the interaction of genetic factors and non-genetic factors. the production of thyroid autoantibodies is related to autosomal dominant inheritance. in europe and north america, hla-b8 and dr3, dr5 are more common in clt patients. the japanese were more common with hla-b35. xu chun et al. used pcr-sscp to detect allele polymorphisms in hla-dqa1 and dqb1 loci in 30 han chinese clt patients, and found that the frequency of dqa1-0301 was significantly higher than that of normal controls. it is speculated that it may be a susceptibility gene in chinese disease. a us research institute analyzed the genes of 56 caucasian families with autoimmune thyroid disease and identified six genes associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. the aitd-1 gene located on chromosome 6 is associated with graves disease and clt; clt-1 on chromosome 13 and clt-2 on chromosome 12 are associated with the pathogenesis of clt, after which they used genomic screening method studied a chinese american family with 27 family members and found that d1is4191 and d9s175 are related to clt, so it is believed that there are different genetic susceptibility to clt among different races, tomer et al.studies have shown that an important decision thyroid autoantibodies gene located on chromosome 2q33, activation pathway essential co-stimulatory factor ctla-4 gene is very likely that genes on chromosome thyroid antibodies 2q33. the mechanism by which immunological factors cause thyroid damage is not fully understood. at present, the following mechanisms are preferred: (1) defects in congenital immune surveillance: the number and quality of organ-specific inhibitory t lymphocytes are abnormal, and t lymphocytes can directly attack thyroid follicular cells. (2) humoral immune-mediated autoimmune mechanism: hk cells can attack thyroid follicular cells in synergy with anti-thyroid antibodies. when antigen-antibody binds, its complex exists in target cell target, activated hk cells and antibodies. the fc fragment reacts to kill target cells. this antibody-dependent cytotoxicity of hk cells is activated by thyroglobulin-thyroglobulin antibody complex in clt and kills with specific cytotoxicity. thyroid follicular cells, in addition, tpoab itself plays a cytotoxic role in thyroid tissue. (3) the lytic effect of anti-thyroid antibodies bound to complement on follicular cells. (4) lymphocyte-mediated toxicity, anti-thyroid antibody triggers and activates it. (5) clt patients are often accompanied by other autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, type i diabetes, chronic active hepatitis, etc., which also prove the existence of autoimmune factors. infection and dietary iodide are the two major environmental factors in the development of clt. wenzel et al. used western blotting to study the anti-yersinia bacterial antibodies in serum of clt patients. the frequency of this antibody was significantly higher than that of patients with non-autoimmune thyroid disease. in contrast to the normal control group, yerinia bacteria in the small intestine and colon were associated with the development of clt. in areas with iodine deficiency or iodine-rich areas, the incidence of clt increases, indicating that iodine plays an important role in the pathogenesis of clt. in excess, genetically susceptible animals can develop thyroiditis, but if iodine is not depleted in the thyroid gland, can prevent the development of severe thyroiditis, the mechanism has not yet been elucidated, rose et al found that the addition of iodine in the diet, clt thyroid damage significantly increased, the incidence of clt increased, thyroglobulin iodization, t cell proliferation in clt, the main increased potency of the pathogenic antigen-tg autoantigen and increased systemic immune response can lead to clt. pathogenesis pathological changes (1) macroscopic view: in typical cases, bilateral thyroid diffuse enlargement, in some cases, the enlargement of one leaf gland is obvious, the gland enlargement is about 2 to 5 times of normal, the surface is smooth or fine nodular, and the capsule complete, thickened, with little adhesion to the surrounding tissue, the cut surface is slightly raised, the texture is tough like rubber, showing obvious or inconspicuous lobulated, gray or grayish yellow, lack of luster due to less gelatin content, similar to hyperplastic lymph nodes there is no bleeding, calcification or necrosis. in the middle and late stages, it can be nodular due to extensive fibrosis, and the texture is hard. some cases adhere to the surrounding tissues. (2) microscopic examination: the main histological features are thyroid follicular destruction, atrophy, decreased glial content in the lumen, follicular epithelial eosinophilia and interstitial lymphocytes, plasma cell infiltration, and prominent germinal center lymph follicular formation and varying degrees of fibrosis. the infiltration of lymphocytes is distributed in the lobules, and there are more between the follicles and the lobes, and there are fewer between the lobes. the lymphocytes between the follicles often form lymphoid follicles or diffuse distribution with germinal centers. the lymphoid follicles are mainly composed of small lymphocytes. it is composed of lymphocytes transformed at various levels in the germinal center, while the diffusely distributed lymphocytes mainly surround the degenerated epithelium, sometimes a small amount of lymphocytes invade into the follicles, between the epithelial cells and the basement membrane, and even invade in the follicular cavity, in addition to small lymphocytes, there are also many different plasma cells, tissue cells, immunoblasts and multinucleated giant cells, and the ratio of lymphoid tissue to thyroid tissue varies, usually around 1/3.","['flatness', 'gothmoid', 'inability', 'gothird', 'difficulty swallowing', 'sufficiency', 'neck lymphadenopathy']","['sjogren's syndrome', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'anemia', 'systemic lupus erythematosus', 'hepatitis', 'edema']","['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(2) adrenal diseases such as adrenal hyperplasia, benign tumors, malignant tumors and dysfunction, which can directly secrete estrogen or produce excessive estrogen precursors (such as androstenone), which are converted into effective in tissues. the estrogen, elevated blood estradiol, causes breast hypertrophy. (3) thyroid diseases such as hyperthyroidism, increased concentrations of plasma serotonin-binding globulin, excessive levels of androgen combined, elevated estradiol (unbound estradiol), and estrogen/testosterone ratio high hormonal imbalance causes stimulation of breast tissue hyperplasia, leading to male breast hypertrophy. (1) liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, etc., accompanied by liver dysfunction, often cause breast hypertrophy. (2) reduced gonadotropin secretion during malnutrition during chronic malnutrition recovery.when malnutrition is corrected, a side-effect second puberty phenomenon occurs, and the appearance of breast hypertrophy is called ""feeding increased breast hypertrophy."" (3) bronchial lung cancer and chronic lung diseases such as oat-like cell carcinoma, tuberculosis, empyema, etc., may cause breast hypertrophy due to local irritation. (4) chronic renal failure chronic renal failure caused by uremia patients, the test found that the blood estrogen is relatively elevated, prolactin concentration also increased, leading to breast development, hypertrophy. (5) nervous system diseases such as paraplegia caused by high spinal cord disease, syringomyelia, hereditary movement disorders, may be associated with breast hypertrophy. (6) prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer patients often take estrogen for treatment, often cause male breast hypertrophy. (7) lymphatic system disease lymphoma, malignant histiocytoma myeloma and other reticuloendothelial diseases, etc., also rare male breast development. (8) drug-induced breast hypertrophy gonadotropin chlorpromazine, cimetidine (cimetidine), methyldopa, metoclopramide (gasprep), metronidazole (metidazole) haze, lisheping (li xueping) sleep and pass, thyroid extract, etc., can bind to estrogen receptors, causing secretion disorders in the body, can cause male breast development, but increased breasts after stopping the drug restore.

male gonads hypofunction,"male hypogonadism is a series of manifestations of testicular dysfunction caused by various causes.the clinical manifestations of male gonad function reduction vary with age at onset.if the gestational age is 2 to 3 months, androgen deficiency occurs, causing pseudohermaphroditism.insufficient androgen deficiency during puberty, manifested as a lack of secondary sexual characteristics and ecstasy, penis is child-type, testicles are small, scrotum is smooth and wrinkle-free, pubic hair and mane are sparse, face, chest and abdomen and back hair are scarce or rare, the voice is thin, the muscles are underdeveloped, and the physical strength is lower than normal.if adult males lack androgen, manifested as loss of libido, impotence, poor physical strength, decreased hair and beard, accompanied by infertility.","the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease is early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment, symptomatic treatment, male hypogonadism caused by hypothalamic-pituitary secretion of gonadotropin deficiency, using gonadotropin treatment, which helps to recover spermatogenic function and promote the development of secondary sexual characteristics, cryptorchidism should use hcg in 2 to 9 years old, stimulate the secretion of endogenous testosterone, it is possible to correct cryptorchidism, the external genitalia have gender deformity, the choice of gender is very important, requires the chosen gender enables the patient to better adapt to social life and have better sexual development during adolescence.","(a) hypothalamic pituitary disease 1.hypothalamic-pituitary tumor inflammation, trauma, surgery, granuloma, etc., affect the production and release of gnrh, insufficient secretion of pituitary gonadotropin, thereby affecting testicular development, reduced androgen production and spermatogenesis defects, male testicular softening, genital atrophy, impotence, libido decreased, infertile, may be associated with hypothalamic syndrome or other manifestations of anterior pituitary dysfunction. 2.gonadotropin-secreting hypogonadism (kallmann syndrome) also known as olfactory loss-like testis syndrome: the intrinsic is congenital, the karyotype is 46xy, the cause may be autosomal dominant, recessive or x-linked inheritance, due to incomplete formation of the olfactory bulb during embryonic development, can cause hypothalamic gnrh secretion is low, leading to hypogonadal function, decreased testosterone secretion, testicular spermatogenic disorder, manifested as lack of smell, secondary sexual dysplasia, similar to no testicular state. 3.simple lh deficiency: the patient has the characteristics of no testicular disease, with male breast development, low serum lh and testosterone, fsh can be normal, seminiferous tubules can produce fertility, and hcg can cause testicular maturation. 4.simple fsh deficiency: less common, interstitial cells can normally secrete testosterone, male sexual characteristics are normal, due to fsh deficiency affects spermatogenesis, causing infertility. 5.low muscle tone - mental retardation - sexual development - obesity syndrome (prader-willi syndrome) the cause is unknown, may be autosomal recessive inheritance, low muscle tone after birth, lethargy, sucking and swallowing reflex disappeared, feeding difficulties, muscle tone improved after several months, polyphagia, obesity, mental retardation, gonadal development defects, secondary sexual dysplasia, may have cryptorchidism, male breast development, mild diabetes, short jaw, eyelid skin, auricular deformity and other congenital anomalies. 6.sexual naive-retinal retinitis-multi-finger (toe) malformation syndrome (laurence-moon-biedl syndrome) for autosomal recessive inheritance, due to congenital defects of hypothalamic-pituitary, causing insufficient secretion of gonadotropin, secondary hypotesty function, patients with mental retardation, growth retardation, secondary sexual characteristics do not appear during puberty, penis and testicles none of them develop, obesity, retinitis pigmentus causes vision loss or blindness, and there are multiple fingers (toes) or fingers (toe) deformities. 7.alstrams syndrome for the pathogenesis of autosomal recessive genes, this disease is rare, clinically and laurence-moon biedl syndrome has many similarities, such as retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, sexual naive, but this disease has no mental retardation and multi-finger (toe) malformation . 8.obesity reproductive incompetence syndrome (froehlish syndrome) any cause (such as craniopharyngioma) caused by hypothalamic-pituitary damage can cause this disease, which is characterized by rapid obesity, drowsiness, polyphagia, delayed bone development, and male breast development or diabetes insipidus in a short period of time. external genital and secondary sexual dysplasia, blood lh, fsh is lower than normal. 9.cortisol the adrenal cortex secretes a large amount of cortisol and androgen, both of which feedback inhibition of pituitary release of gonadotropin, which reduces testosterone secretion and hypogonadism. 10.congenital adrenal hyperplasia refers to the congenital deficiency of certain enzymes in the synthesis of adrenal corticosteroids, resulting in decreased cortisol synthesis, decreased feedback inhibition, increased acth secretion in the pituitary gland, resulting in adrenal hyperplasia, cholesterol synthesis in testosterone five enzymes are required (figure 15-56), in which cholesterol carbon chain enzyme (20,22-carbon chain lyase), 3汕-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17-hydroxylase are present in both the adrenal gland and the testis in tissues, their defects lead to adrenal synthesis of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid disorders, leading to testicular synthesis of testosterone disorders. in the early stage of male embryos, if there is a serious defect in testosterone synthesis, it affects the masculinization of the fetus, which may occur in the vagina, under the urethra. crack, cryptorchidism, but no uterus and fallopian tubes, cholesterol carbon chain enzyme deficiency, cholesterol can not be converted to pregnenolone, cortisol, aldosterone and sex hormone synthesis have barriers, a large amount of cholesterol deposition, causing lipid adrenal hyperplasia, clinically adrenal insufficiency, male pseudo-sexual malformation, patients often early lossdefects in 3汕-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase lead to chronic adrenal insufficiency, increased acth, adrenal hyperplasia; male genital differentiation and development, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, breast development, etc., 17-ketosteroids in urine, 17 - hydroxylase deficiency, decreased cortisol secretion, elevated acth, 11-deoxycorticosterone, male genitalia are female or pseudo-hermaphroditism, vas deferens can have different degrees of development, blood pregnenolone is elevated help with diagnosis. 11.hyperprolactinemia prl can inhibit the secretion of lh and fsh, so that testicular secretion of testosterone and seminiferous tubules can reduce spermatogenesis, which can be associated with male breast development and galactorrhea. 12.familial cerebellar ataxia is a familial disease characterized by sexual naivety, small external genitalia, small and soft testicles, less mane, female pubic hair, high pitch, tall body and no testicular shape, and low mental retardation. dementia, slow cerebellar ataxia, with neurological deafness, optic atrophy. 13.hemochromatosis is autosomal recessive, due to excessive absorption of iron in the intestinal mucosa and iron storage barrier in reticuloendothelial cells, excessive iron deposition in the hypothalamic pituitary, decreased gonadotropin secretion, hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and male breast development. (b) testicular dysfunction 1.testicular development and structural abnormalities (1) congenital testicular hypoplasia syndrome (klinefelter syndrome): is a more common genetic disease of sex chromosome aberrations, see klinefelter syndrome. (2) 46, xx male syndrome: the intrinsic sex chromosome is xx, no y chromosome, hy antigen can be detected in serum, suggesting that there is a small amount of y embedded in x or autosome, which can not be found in vitro culture, and its phenotype is in males, the incidence rate is 1:20,000 to 24,000. the patient lacks all female genitalia and has male psychological characteristics. the clinical manifestations are similar to klinefelter syndrome: the testicles are small and hard (generally less than 2 cm). there are often male breast development, penis size is normal or slightly smaller than normal adults, usually with sperm deficiency and glassy changes of seminiferous tubules, blood testosterone levels are reduced, estradiol levels are elevated, gonadotropin levels are elevated, clinically this type is similar to the xxy/xy chimeric type, with short stature, mental retardation and personality changes are very light, and relatively rare, the incidence of hypospadias is increased. (3) male turner syndrome: autosomal dominant inheritance, nuclear shape 46, xy, clinical manifestations of typical turner syndrome: short stature, neck brace, elbow eversion, congenital heart disease, male phenotype, often there are cryptorchidism, testicular shrinkage, seminiferous tubule dysplasia, sexual naive, blood testosterone decreased, serum gonadotropin levels increased, a small number of patients with normal testes, and fertile. (4) adult seminiferous tubules can be reduced: causes include orchitis, cryptorchidism, radiation damage, uremia, alcoholism, anti-tumor drugs, etc., without clear cause, impaired light, testicular biopsy can be seen in various stages of germ cells the number is reduced, and the growth of germ cells is stopped at the stage of spermatogonial cells or primary spermatocytes. in severe cases, there are no germ cells, only intact support cells, and the most severe cases are fibrosis and transparency. deformation, clinical manifestations of infertility, testicular mild to moderate atrophy, interstitial cells secrete testosterone function, secondary sexual characteristics developed well, no breast development, semen examination showed less sperm or no sperm, blood testosterone or lh concentration normal the basal blood fsh is normal or increased, and the fsh is excessively increased after stimulation with gnrh. (5) interstitial cell hypoplasia: fetal interstitial cells secrete testosterone disorder, resulting in male pseudohermaphroditism, testicular but spermatogenic disorder, vulvar deformity, female phenotype, penis similar to clitoris, blind end vagina, but no uterus , fallopian tube, to adolescence only found primary amenorrhea, pubic hair, scarce hair, patients fsh, lh base value increased, gnrh test gonadotropin response was obvious, blood testosterone was significantly lower, hcg stimulation did not increase. (6) there is no testicular disease: the embryonic stage causes complete atrophy of the testicle due to infection, trauma, vascular embolism or testicular torsion. the phenotype is male. the second sex of adolescent male is not developed, and the external genitalia remains immature. without testicles, if you do not give androgen treatment as early as possible, there will be a lieutenant body type. if residual or ectopic stromal cells secrete androgen, moderate second sexual characteristics may occur, blood testosterone levels are low, and gonadotropin is significantly elevated. high, testosterone does not increase after hcg stimulation. (7) cryptorchidism: can be unilateral or bilateral, with the most common in the groin, because the intra-abdominal temperature is higher than the temperature inside the scrotum, so the spermatogenic function of the cryptorchidism is inhibited, and easy to cancer, cryptorchidism is generally no symptoms, can not touch the testis on one or both sides, no orrogen deficiency, often accompanied by infertility, and no testicular disease, cryptorchidism patients with hcg stimulation, testosterone significantly increased. (8) atrophic myotonia: adult onset, facial, neck, hand and lower extremity muscle tonic atrophy, ptosis, frontal muscle compensatory contraction, increased frontal ridge, 80% with primary testicular function decreased, serum fsh is significantly elevated, is a familial disease, autosomal dominant inheritance. (9) adult interstitial cell hypofunction: also known as male menopausal syndrome, males gradually appear sexual dysfunction after age 50, may have personality and mood changes, blood testosterone gradually reduced, gonadotropin increased, sperm decreased or lack. (10) immotile cilia syndrome: an autosomal recessive genetic defect characterized by respiratory tract and sperm cilia activity disorders, such as kartagener syn-drome, expressed as visceral reversal ectopic, chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis triad, infertility due to sperm cilia movement disorders. 2.acquired testicular abnormalities (1) testicular infection: can be divided into non-specific, viral, fungal, spirochete, parasitic and other types, mumps virus-induced viral orchitis is the most common, clinical manifestations of affected testicular swelling and pain scrotal skin edema, hydrocele of the sac, often with chills and high fever, abdominal pain, and the testicles may have different degrees of atrophy after the disease, and some patients may cause infertility. (2) trauma: the testicles are vulnerable to external violence, and the disappearance of spermatogonial cells in the seminiferous tubules leads to infertility. if there is a hematoma, destroying blood supply can also lead to testicular atrophy. (3) radiation damage: spermatogonia is very sensitive to radiation damage. if it is damaged, oligozoospermia or azoospermia may occur. (4) drugs: spironolactone and ketoconazole can inhibit testosterone synthesis. spironolactone and cimetidine compete with androgen for cytoplasmic receptor protein and interfere with the role of testosterone in target cells. taking mediostatin, digitalis can make plasma estradiol. increased testosterone decreased, long-term alcohol abuse, can cause plasma testosterone reduction, anti-tumor and chemotherapy drugs, insecticides, dibromochloropropane, cadmium and lead, can inhibit spermatogenesis, leading to infertility. (5) autoimmunity: schmidt syndrome has anti-testicular basement membrane antibody. if the blood-testis barrier is destroyed, semen acts as an antigen and produces an autoimmune reaction, producing anti-sperm antibodies, male prostatitis or epididymitis, especially e. coli infection. when anti-sperm antibodies are produced, sperm granuloma can be formed after vas deferens obstruction or severance. sperm destroys and absorbs in sperm granuloma to form antigen, and produces anti-sperm antibodies. currently, two types of anti-sperm antibodies, spermatozoa, can be detected. agglutination antibodies and sperm-braking antibodies, anti-sperm antibody, can reduce sperm motility and sperm agglutination or non-liquefaction, in addition, anti-sperm antibodies can promote immune orchitis, produce antigen-antibody complex deposition in testicular germ cells on, affecting the occurrence of normal sperm. 3.testicular abnormal systemicdiseases associated withsystemic diseases such as chronic liver disease, renal insufficiency, severe malnutrition, metabolic disorders, diabetes, etc. can lead to testicular dysfunction and infertility. (3) male hormone synthesis or its deficiency in function the karyotype of the patient is 46, xy, and the gonad is the testis. due to the deficiency of androgen, the development of sexual organs in the embryo is not completely masculine, forming male pseudohermaphroditism, according to the cause there are roughly three categories: 1.male hormone synthesis defects in the testosterone production pathway, there are five different enzymes involved, and any one of the enzyme defects can cause testosterone synthesis disorder, which leads to male pseudohermaphroditism, in which cholesterol carbon chain enzyme (20, 22 carbon chain) lysing enzyme), 3汕-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17 hydroxylase is present in the testis and adrenal glands. if these three defects, not only cause male pseudohermaphroditism, but also cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia; the other two the enzyme (17, 20 carbon chain lyase, and 17汕-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) is only present in the testis, and if it is defective, it only causes male pseudohermaphroditism. 2.degeneration of the renal tubular insufficiency is also a rare autosomal recessive or x-linked recessive hereditary disease. during the fetal period, the cell supports the secretion of paraneoplastic inhibitory factor (mif), or binds to the receptor, making 46 male patients in xy retain part of the female reproductive duct (fallopian tube, uterus, 1/3 of the vagina). because mif and testicular descending substances are secreted by supporting cells, degeneration of the secondary renal tube may be accompanied by ipsilateral cryptorchidism. testicular hypoplasia may also be associated with mixed gonadal dysplasia with a high cancer rate. 3.androgen insensitivity (1) testicular feminizaation syndrome: male pseudohermaphroditism, patients with pathogenic androgen receptor and post-receptor defects, are not sensitive to androgen and cause disease, x-linked sexual genetic disorders, intrinsic complete and incomplete two types, 1 complete androgen insensitivity - testicular feminization, also known as complete male pseudohermaphroditism, karyotype 46, xy, in the embryonic period, in the abdominal cavity or the genital area has developed testes. because the middle kidney tube is not sensitive to androgen, it cannot be further differentiated into vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and ejaculatory ducts. the genital area cannot differentiate into males, but the fetal testicular support cells can still secrete mif. therefore, the defecation of the renal tube is degraded, no fallopian tube, uterus and upper vagina. the external genitalia is completely female when born. it has a shallow blind end vagina. in the diain or genital area of the child, the testicle can be touched. in adolescence, due to the target organ pair androgen is not sensitive, causing increased secretion of lh, thus increasing testosterone, testosterone conversion to produce estradiol, so that women with secondary sexual characteristics, such as full breast however, there are primary amenorrhea, a small number of patients with enlarged clitoris, mild masculinity, post-puberty, testicular mucosal changes, should be removed, 2 incomplete androgen insensitivity, also known as incomplete male leave sexual malformation type i, reifenstein syndrome, karyotype 46, xy, due to partial orrogen receptor defects or post-receptor defects, phenotype biased to men, but the degree of masculinity is very different, severe genitalia malformation, blind-type vagina, perineal scrotum-type hypospadias, mild manifestations of dysplastic male external genitalia, small penis, hypospadias and scrotal bifurcation, puberty, poor masculinization, male breast development more fertility, testosterone, lh and estradiol are elevated. (2) 5a-reductase deficiency: also known as incomplete male pseudohermaphroditism type ii, is autosomal recessive, nucleus is 46, xy, due to lack of 5a-reductase, testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone deficiency male external genital development disorder, manifested as small penis, perineal hypospadias, scrotum is bilobal, patients have testes, epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicles, no uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries, puberty, masculinity, no male breast development the sperm count is normal, the plasma testosterone level is normal or increased, the dihydrotestosterone is lowered, and the lh is increased. the clinical manifestations of male gonad function reduction vary with age at onset, such as hormonal deficiency at 2 to 3 months, causing pseudohermaphroditism, androgen deficiency during puberty, and a lack of secondary sexual characteristics. the shape of the stagnation disease, the penis is child-type, the testicle is small, the scrotum is smooth and wrinkle-free, the pubic hair and the mane are sparse, the face, chest, abdomen and back hair are scarce or rare, the voice is thin, the muscle is underdeveloped, and the physical strength is lower than normal. male androgen deficiency, manifested as loss of libido, impotence, poor physical strength, decreased hair and beard, accompanied by infertility.","['recurrent genital ulcers', 'testicular hypoplasia', 'testicular micro-', 'second sexual change']",['male infertility'],['andrology'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
mucopolysaccharidosis,"mucopolysaccharide deposition is a hereditary lysosomal disease caused by the degradation of acid mucopolysaccharide due to lysosomal enzyme deficiency, the deposition of a large amount of mucopolysaccharide in tissues and the excretion of mucopolysaccharide in urine.according to different enzyme defects and different clinical manifestations are divided into multiple types.there are big differences between the different types.clinical manifestations involve multiple organs, with mental retardation, physical developmental disorders, and ocular lesions being the most common manifestations.","mucopolysaccharidosis is caused by congenital defects of lysosomal acid hydrolase. in addition to complying with the marriage law, avoiding marriage of close relatives and reducing the incidence of genetic diseases in offspring, there is no effective preventive measure. according to the statistics of the literature, there are dozens of successful cases of bone marrow transplantation in foreign countries. if the operation is successful, the risk of organ failure can be successfully relieved. although the child's mental development, bone growth may be slightly worse than normal peers, but there is no problem with the life of a normal person.","mucopolysaccharidosis is caused by a congenital defect of the cell lysosomal acid hydrolase, which is characterized by excessive accumulation and excretion of oligosaccharides.","['hepatosplenomegaly', 'humpback', 'cornea opacity', 'dai chao', 'neck short', 'shock']",['arteriosclerosis'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['more symptomatic treatment, for type iv alternative treatment, other types of feasible bone marrow transplantation treatment']"
men's breast development,"men's breast development is a common endocrine disease, breast enlargement is the only clinical manifestation. normal males in the neonatal, adolescent and old age, breasts can be physiologically increased; but between adolescence and old age men, if the breast enlargement, is mostly pathological, should find the cause in time.it is generally believed that in addition to three conditions in a person's life (transient hyperplasia of the newborn, enlarged mammary gland and occasional mammary gland hyperplasia in older men), the breast tissue can be regarded as abnormal.","with the improvement of economic level and the accelerated pace of life, lifestyles, eating habits, etc. have changed a lot. the incidence of male breast hypertrophy in china is increasing. although there is no exact data, the number of seekers is increasing year by year. breast diseases have a certain malignant rate like female mammary gland diseases. therefore, how to use medical treatment to block over-differentiation and proliferation of mammary gland cells caused by excessive estrogen in males has always been the focus of specialist research and the majority of patients. expectation. when the estrogen level in the body is relatively or absolutely increased due to various reasons, the mammary epithelial cells may be stimulated by excessive estrogen, and abnormal development of the male breast may occur. if the male finds that he has breast hypertrophy, he should go to the hospital as soon as possible to confirm the diagnosis. it is physiologically medicinal, so you don't have to be too nervous, you can dissipate on your own or disappear after stopping the drug. if it is pathological, you should seriously look for the cause and treat the cause in time. men's breast hypertrophy is earlier. give positive and effective treatment can return to normal; and for a long time, when breast tissue hyperplasia is more serious, it is irreversible change, which means that it is easy to be cancerous and must be treated surgically. therefore, if a man finds abnormal breast, he should see a doctor promptly. through drug control, reduce the amount of estrogen in the body, while self-regulating, the mood remains stable and try to avoid taking estrogen-containing drugs and food.","estrogen promotes the development of the mammary gland, and androgen inhibits it. if the estrogen is too much, the androgen is reduced, the ratio of estrogen and androgen is imbalanced, or the estrogen receptor is increased, and the sensitivity of the breast tissue to estrogen is increased. . testosterone secreted by leydig cells is regulated by pituitary lh, testosterone is aromatized in peripheral tissues and converted to estrogen, or reduced to dihydrotestosterone. male testosterone production is more than 100 times greater than estradiol, if this effective ratio is significantly reduced the breasts increase. histological features are mainly breast tube hyperplasia, cystic enlargement and fibrous adipose tissue hyperplasia, no acinar structure, no mammary gland lobes, long-term glandular epithelial degeneration, and decreased mammary duct.",['male breasts big'],['mammary hyperplasia'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
endocrine eyeball,"endocrine regulates the oxidation and metabolism of various organs and tissues of the human body, thus maintaining the normal health of the human body.if the secretion is too much or too little, it will cause diseases. clinically, it can be divided into two types: thyroid toxic eyeball protrusion and thyrotropin-promoting eyeball protrusion. endocrine ocular protrusions include thyroid-related, acromegaly-related and adrenal hyperfunction, but clinically mainly thyroid-related, also known as thyroid-related immune eyelid disease, is an important cause of eye protrusion in both adults and eyes.the disease refers to eyelid inflammation associated with thyroid dysfunction and immune system disorders, but clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism or normal thyroid function, the latter also has the author's name for eye-shaped graves disease.the disease is more common in adults, bilateral onset, the degree can be inconsistent.some patients have a tendency to heal themselves.",pay more attention to diet and no other effective preventive measures.,"nan the occurrence ofthyroid toxic ocular ocular thyroid toxic exophthalmosmay be due to the sympathetic nerve being in an excited state, which causes the orbital smooth muscle to contract and pull the eyeball forward; on the other hand, the extraocular rectus muscle becomes thick and loose, thereby reducing the pulling force of the back of the eyeball makes the movement of the ken ball move forward, and since the secondary fat in the sputum fills the gap left behind the eyeball, the eyeball cannot recover the original even under external pressure. position. thyrotropin-induced ocular gonadotropin anterior pituitary hyperfunction or thyroid gland removal, caused by excessive thyrotropin secretion, called pituitary exophthalmos (malignant exophthalmos), recent research results suggest that may be related to immune factors, under normal circumstances the anti-meal effect between thyroxine and thyrotropin is in equilibrium. therefore, when the eye is in a state of thyroidectomy, there is a risk of promoting the development of the eye.","['gyt enlargement', 'visual papillary edema', 'corneal ulcer', 'keratitis', 'double vision']",['exposure keratitis'],"[' ent', 'ophthalmology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
sebaceous gland,"sebaceous adenine (nevussebaceus) is a proliferative disease caused by an abnormal increase in sebaceous glands in the skin. it is also called organ-like sputum. this disease occurs more than at birth or shortly after birth.occasionally on the head and face.the local mass is pale yellow, and the enlarged sebaceous gland opening is a feature of the disease.surgical resection is reliable.",there is currently no effective preventive measure.,"(a) the cause of the disease this disease is a congenital dysplasia, mainly in the skin sebaceous gland, epidermis, other skin appendages and dermis are also involved in its formation. (ii) pathogenesis the pathological changes of sebaceous glands vary with the length of the disease. in infants and childhood, the sebaceous glands are poorly developed in the history, the apocrine glands are not recognized, the epidermis is mildly hyperplasia, and small hair follicles and undifferentiated epithelial cell cords are visible. during the development of the germ, a large number of mature or nearly mature sebaceous glands can be seen in the lesions. the epidermis above it tends to be papillary-like hyperplasia, and the acanthal hypertrophy can be seen. under the sebaceous gland lobule, ectopic apocrine glands can be seen in the elderly. in the skin lesions of the patients, the epidermis is hyperplastic, and sometimes the sebaceous glands are tumor-like hyperplasia.","['pimples', 'nodule']",['basal cell carcinoma'],"['dermatology department', 'dermatology']","['symptom treatment', 'surgical treatment']"
tracheobronchial foreign body,"foreign body of tracheal bronchus (foreignbody oftracheaandbronchus) is a common clinical emergency, foreign body can remain in the throat, throat, trachea and bronchus, causing hoarseness, difficulty breathing, etc., right bronchus is thick and short, so foreign matter easily falls into the right main bronchus .75% occur in children under 2 years of age.severity depends on the nature of the foreign body and the degree of airway obstruction. lighter can cause lung damage, and severe cases can suffocate and die.foreign bodies are endogenous and exogenous.endogenous foreign bodies are pseudomembranes, dryness, blood clots, pus, vomit, etc. due to inflammation of the respiratory tract.exogenous foreign bodies are various objects that are inhaled by the mouth.","1. first of all, educate children not to develop the habit of mouth inclusions.when children have food in their mouths, don't tease them to laugh, talk or scare. they should patiently persuade them to spit out and not snoring to prevent food from being inhaled into the trachea.if the child is already crying, it can no longer be forced to eat, otherwise it will easily lead to foreign matter entering the respiratory tract.keep small items that your child can easily inhale where children can't get them. toys should be safe. 2. when a child vomits, he should turn his head to one side, so that he can easily spit out, so as not to inhale the trachea. 3, if there are foreign bodies in the pharynx, you can never use your fingers to dig, or you can use the method of swallowing large pieces of food to suppress the foreign matter, you should try to induce it to spit out. 4, children under the age of 3 should try to eat less dried fruit, beans, parents and caregivers should pay attention to children, do not give melon seeds, peanuts and other food to children.","according to the source of foreign matter, there are two types of endogenous foreign bodies and exogenous foreign bodies. the former is a pseudomembrane in the respiratory tract, dryness, and cheese-like necrosis. the foreign body of the tracheobronchial is usually exogenous. all items inhaled by the mouth, foreign matter entering the trachea and bronchi are related to the following situations. 1. young children like to grab food and inhale the trachea when crying or laughing. 2, children's teeth development is imperfect, chewing function is poor, can not chew hard food, plus the defense of the throat is poor, the protection is not perfect. 3. when you are joking or working, you may have food or articles in your mouth. if you accidentally or when you are laughing, you may inhale the trachea. 4, general anesthesia or coma patients, when the tracheal intubation may also loose teeth or dentures are not found; other vomit removal is not timely, can be inhaled into the trachea. 5. during upper airway surgery, the instrument device is unstable, or the excised tissue suddenly slips off the airway. 6. psychiatric patients or attempted suicides. foreign matter enters the trachea, caused by the bronchi, and is related to the nature of the foreign body, the residence time of the foreign body and the shape of the foreign body. in general, botanical foreign bodies such as peanuts are highly irritating to the mucous membrane due to the presence of free fatty acid, after entering the trachea. inflammation of the bronchial mucosa can occur in 2 to 3 days, manifested as mucosal congestion, edema, increased secretions, and partial obstructive manifestations. with the increase of secretions, and the swelling of foreign bodies after water absorption, complete obstruction may occur. the secretions gradually turned into purulent, and some showed granulation growth around the foreign body, and surrounded by foreign bodies, when sharp foreign matter entered the trachea, some could damage the mucosa, local mucosal hemorrhage, followed by congestion and swelling, metallic foreign bodies and animals sex, chemical products are less irritating to the mucous membranes, less inflammation occurs, but if the residence time is long, trachea and bronchial inflammation can occur, followed by pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema and so on.","['face of bruises', 'chest pain', 'weeping sound', 'breathing difficulty', 'coughing', 'hemoptysis', 'suppur"", 'injury above tracheal carina', 'abscess']",['emphysema'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

breast hyperplasia,"breast hyperplasia is a common breast disease in women.the naming of this disease is very confusing, also known as lobular hyperplasia, mammary gland dysplasia, fibrocystic disease.in the past, it was called chronic cystic mastitis. in fact, there is no inflammatory change in this disease, so it is not suitable for application.the disease is characterized by the proliferation of components of the breast, showing abnormalities in structure, quantity and histomorphology, so it is called cystic hyperplasia or mammary gland dysplasia.","daily prevention of breast hyperplasia 1. psychological treatment is very important. the harm of breast hyperplasia to the human body is psychological damage. due to the lack of correct understanding of the disease, the psychological factors of excessive psychological stress stimulate anxiety and sadness, resulting in neurasthenia, which will aggravate endocrine disorders promote the aggravation of hyperplasia, so all kinds of bad psychological stimulation should be relieved. those who suffer poor psychological attention should pay more attention to it, be less angry, keep their emotions stable, and lively and cheerful mood is beneficial to early recovery. 2, change diet, prevent obesity, eat less fried foods, animal fats, sweets and excessive tonic foods, eat more vegetables and fruits, eat more coarse grains, black soybeans best, eat more walnuts, black sesame seeds, black fungus, mushroom. 3, life should be regular, work and rest, to maintain a harmonious life, can regulate endocrine disorders, to maintain smooth stool will reduce breast pain. 4, more exercise, prevent obesity and improve immunity. 5. it is forbidden to abuse contraceptives and estrogen-containing beauty products, and not to eat estrogen-fed chickens and beef. 6, to avoid the flow of people, maternal feeding, can prevent problems before they happen. 7. self-examination and regular review. health education i. life conditioning 1. pay attention to the general survey and self-examination of breast diseases. 2. prompt marriage and childbirth, actively breastfeeding, and pay attention to keep the nipple clean and avoid trauma. 3. actively prevent and treat related gynecological diseases and endocrine system diseases. 4. create a harmonious family atmosphere, the husband and wife live in harmony and advocate a harmonious and happy husband and wife life. 5. carefully use beauty products that contain high levels of estrogen. 6. the living is regular, work and rest, and pay attention to keep the stool smooth. second, mental conditioning to improve literacy, open-minded, maintain a good mental state, to avoid bad mental stimulation, such as nervousness, depression, anger, sadness, etc., eliminate the fear of cancer, and establish confidence in the fight against disease.","mental stimulation can alter the environment of the human body, thereby affecting the function of the endocrine system, leading to abnormal secretion of one or several hormones.unhealthy mental factors such as excessive mental stress and emotional excitement may cause the mammary gland hyperplasia that should be restored to be incapable of recovery or incomplete recovery. over time, mammary gland hyperplasia will be formed, and these bad mental stimuli will aggravate existing mammary glands. hyperplastic symptoms. there are also many human factors and lifestyle factors, people flow, non-fertility or childbearing over 30 years old, no breastfeeding, husband and wife, hormone-containing health products, etc., wearing a tight bra, too tight bra is easy to oppress lymph and blood cycling is a hindrance to breast health. in addition, the diet structure is not reasonable, such as excessive intake of fat, can affect the endocrine of the ovary, strengthen the stimulation of estrogen on the mammary epithelial cells and lead to breast hyperplasia.","['breast pain', 'nipple discharge', 'stopping', 'breast lumps', 'breast pain']",['breast tumor'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
breast cancer,"breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women. according to statistics, the incidence rate is 7-10% of all kinds of malignant tumors in the body. in women, it is second only to uterine cancer. its incidence is often related to heredity, and 40-60. between the ages, the incidence of women before and after menopause is high, and only about 1-2% of breast patients are male.a malignant tumor that usually occurs in the glandular epithelial tissue of the breast.it is one of the most common malignant tumors that seriously affect women's physical and mental health and even life-threatening. breast cancer is rare in men. the cause of breast cancer is not fully understood. the study found that there is a certain regularity in the incidence of breast cancer. women with high risk factors for breast cancer are prone to breast cancer.the so-called high-risk factors refer to various risk factors associated with the onset of breast cancer, and most of the risk factors for breast cancer patients are called high risk factors for breast cancer.early detection and early diagnosis of breast cancer are the key to improving the efficacy. the treatment methods for breast cancer include: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and traditional chinese medicine treatment. the common treatment methods for western medicine are radiotherapy after chemotherapy, chemotherapy to kill cancer in the body. surgery and radiotherapy are local treatments. .chemotherapy is a treatment method that uses anticancer drugs to inhibit cancer cell division and destroy cancer cells. although it is also a holistic treatment, it has a large side effect and cannot completely control recurrence and metastasis. tcm treatment of tumor emphasizes the principle of regulation and balance, restores and enhances the disease resistance inside the body, thus achieving the goal of yin and yang balance treatment of tumor.during the treatment, the doctor will take into account the patient's local treatment and systemic treatment, seek cure for early and mid-stage breast cancer patients, improve the quality of life, and prolong life for advanced patients.","daily prevention of breast cancer early breast cancer found is known that cancer is not incurable, the key is early detection and early treatment, over the years, has been confirmed in clinical practice, for most cancer is, if you want to improve the cure rate alone improvement of treatment methods, the results are unsatisfactory, in terms of breast cancer, in recent decades, although the treatment methods at home and abroad have undergone various improvements, but the mortality rate has not decreased significantly, the reason the most important reason is still due to the late treatment. among the patients treated, the majority of the middle and late cases are caused. this requires us to advocate the detection of early cancer to reduce the appearance of advanced cancer, which will be effective in improving the survival rate of breast cancer. way. modern requirements for early breast cancer should be that small cancers (0, 5 cm in diameter) and to cancers that are clinically inaccessible to the mass are classified as early, because such cancers are rarely metastasized, and their 10-year survival rate after surgery is generally up to 90% or more, a large number of such cancers will be detected, which may have a positive effect on survival rate. in order to detect such early cancer more, the following points are proposed: 1. establish a new concept of early cancer: among the patients examined daily, early cancer is not uncommon, and it should be more common than the common advanced cancer, because in the natural course of breast cancer growth, the preclinical period accounts for about 2/3 of the whole process. however, early cancer is very less detected, indicating that most of the early cancer was leaked from the examiner during the examination. the reason is mainly due to the lack of sufficient knowledge of the early cancer by the examiner. the vast majority of the patients still use breast lumps as a result. the traditional concept of diagnosing the primary signs of breast cancer, while the aforementioned early cancer does not necessarily form a significant mass, under the guidance of this concept, early cancer is inevitably difficult to detect, so we should re-recognize the new concept of early cancer. 2, seriously query the risk factors of breast cancer: breast cancer is susceptible to many factors, the following are common: (1) family history of breast cancer, especially whether the mother and sister of the subject have had the disease (2) menstruation premature menarche (less than 12 years old), or late (more than 50 years old) (3) more than 40 years old (4) one side of the breast has cancer, the contralateral breast is also a vulnerable part, etc. people with factors should be considered as susceptible to breast cancer and should be the focus of examination. 3. any cause of abnormalities in the breast should be identified. (1) nipple discharge, especially bloody discharge, coexists with breast cancer, especially when there is bloody discharge in women over 50 years old, about half of them may be malignant. (2) localized thickening of the breast gland, which is a clinically common but not valued sign. this situation occurs in women who are not menopausal, especially when there are some changes in the menstrual cycle. if the thickened tissue persists for a long time, it has nothing to do with the menstrual cycle, or it is increasing and increasing in scope, especially in postmenopausal women. (3) nipple erosion after repeated local treatment is ineffective, should consider the disease, the positive rate of cell smear is high, should be promptly diagnosed. (4) breast pain, in premenopausal women, especially with menstrual cycle changes, the degree of pain also has different changes in light or heavy, mostly physiological, such as pain is limited, there are fixed parts, and has nothing to do with the menstrual cycle or for postmenopausal women, the cause should be identified. (5) unexplained areola skin edema, nipple retraction and breast skin limitation depression, etc., all need to carefully find out the reasons. in short, early detection and early treatment are undoubtedly the development direction of breast cancer prevention and treatment. what is urgently needed is to popularize the knowledge of early breast cancer diagnosis, extensively carry out breast cancer screening and women's self-examination of breast, in order to achieve early improvement of survival rate and mortality. the goal of. health education 1, research believes that high-fat diet and breast cancer have a certain relationship, so should reduce the intake of fatty foods, such as fat, butter, butter, egg yolk, etc., eat less fried, fried foods. in addition to excess coffee and caffeinated drinks, avoid smoking. usually eat more green vegetables, fruits and other foods rich in vitamins. 2. maintain a good mental state. work stress, excessive mental stress, and disordered life rhythm can cause endocrine disorders, decreased immunity, and is conducive to tumor growth. therefore, work, life, and entertainment should be arranged reasonably. always relax yourself, participate in physical exercise and social activities, adjust the pace of life, reduce mental stress and psychological stress. 3, often breast self-examination.adult women should always perform breast self-examination, usually once a month. a breast cancer is found to be different from the usual abnormal situation. you should go to the hospital in time to ask the doctor to exclude breast cancer.women over the age of 40 should have an annual clinical examination and mammography to detect early lesions. 4, to avoid a large number of long-term use of estrogen.estrogen deficient patients may experience signs of climacteric syndrome such as fatigue, fatigue, irritability, excessive sweating, and insomnia. appropriate estrogen replacement therapy can alleviate these symptoms and rejuvenate the patient.however, it should be properly applied under the guidance of a doctor, and it should not be taken without authorization, and it should not be taken in large quantities for a long time.during the period of taking, regular breast examination should be carried out. people at high risk should pay special attention to breast health. the so-called high-risk group refers to the group whose risk of breast cancer is higher than that of the normal population. this group should pay more attention to their breast health and detect the breast in the early stage. cancer.the currently identified high-risk factors include unmarried and unfertile, primiparous age >35 years old, no breastfeeding, early tidal menarche (<12 years old), closed jing later, breast cancer history in first-degree relatives, and one breast history of cancer, cystic hyperplasia of the breast with moderate and severe dysplasia of epithelial cells (especially cells with heterosexuality, long-term use of estrogens).","in women, the incidence rate increases with age, is rare before menarche, and is rare before 20 years old, but the incidence rate rises rapidly after 20 years old, 45 to 50 years old, but relatively flat, after menopause the incidence rate continues to rise, reaching its peak at around 70 years of age, and the mortality rate also rises with age. after the age of 25, the mortality rate gradually rises until the old age. it is the early stage of breast cancer. when the cancer is confined to the mammary duct or acinus, it is called non-invasive cancer when it does not break through the basement membrane.(1) intraductal cancer: the cancer cells are confined to the catheter and do not break through the basement membrane of the wall.it occurs mostly in small and medium-sized catheters. larger catheters are rare and generally have a multi-center scattered distribution.(2) lobular carcinoma in situ: cancer occurring in the lobular duct and peripheral duct epithelial cells, more common in premenopausal women, the age of onset is 5-10 years earlier than the average breast cancer.the leaflets are enlarged, the tubes and bubbles are increased, and the cells are obviously thickened, and are filled with non-polar cancer cells.lobular carcinoma in situ develops slowly and has a good prognosis. (1) papillary carcinoma: it occurs in the epithelial cells of the large breast duct, and the cancerous parenchyma is mainly composed of a fibrous vascular bundle or a fibrous papillary bundle, and may be a non-invasive and invasive papillary carcinoma. its infiltration often occurs at the base of the nipple hyperplasia. (2) medullary carcinoma is accompanied by a large number of lymphocytic infiltration: necrosis and hemorrhage often occur in the cut surface, and a large number of lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrate in the interstitial cells of large cancer cells. it is more obvious in the peripheral part of the cancer, and is generally considered to be the resistance of the body to the tumor. (3) tubulocarcinoma: occurs in ductal or small ductal epithelial cells, which is a type with low malignancy and a good prognosis. (4) adenoid cystic carcinoma: basal cell-like cells form patches or small stains of different sizes and shapes, with a number of circular cavities of different sizes and uniformity. myoepithelial cells can be seen around the luminal surface and around the cell mass. (5) apocrine adenoid carcinoma: cancer cells are rich in cytoplasm, acidophilic, sometimes visible apical prominence, nucleus mild to moderately shaped, forming ductal, acinar or small nipple structure. (6) mucinous adenocarcinoma: occurs on the basis of mammary glandular epithelial mucinous gland metaplasia, more common in women near menopause or postmenopausal, especially in women over 60 years old. in the cancer parenchyma, the epithelial mucus component accounts for more than half. most of the mucus is outside the cell, forming a mucus lake; occasionally in the cell, it shows a sign-like cell. (7) squamous cell carcinoma: a ductal epithelium derived from squamous metaplasia. the cancerous parenchyma is all typical squamous cell carcinoma, and the intercellular bridge and keratinization can be seen. if other types of cancer develop partial squamous metaplasia, they are not listed here. (8) nipple pie disease: also known as nipple eczema-like cancer, paget (1874) first described the disease. after years of research, it is believed that the morphology of the tumor cells under the microscope is large, the cytoplasm is rich and lightly stained, often vacuolated, the nucleus is large, obviously irregular, and occasionally mitotic figures. (1) invasive lobular carcinoma: lobular carcinoma is infiltrated into the extralobular area, including small cell type invasive carcinoma. (2) invasive ductal carcinoma: ductal carcinoma clearly infiltrates the interstitial, but the infiltrated part does not exceed half of the cancerous substance. if it is more than half, it is named after the main form of invasive cancer. (3) hard cancer: the cancer cells are arranged in a thin strip or scattered, rarely forming an adenoid structure, and the fibrous interstitial component accounts for more than two-thirds and is dense. (4) medullary carcinoma: the cancer nest is densely flaky or clumpy, and may have an adenoid structure. the cancer parenchyma accounts for more than two-thirds, and the interstitial may have a small amount of lymphocytes and plasma cells. (5) simple cancer; between hard cancer and medullary carcinoma, that is, the ratio of cancerous substance to fibrous interstitial component is similar.cancer cells mainly form irregular solid strips or small stains, and may also have adenoid structures. (6) adenocarcinoma: the size of cancer cells is consistent, the cytoplasm is rich, and there may be secretion, deep nuclear staining, and mitotic figures are common. the cancer cells are arranged in a glandular tube, with many layers, disordered polarity, lack of basement membrane, and infiltrating growth in the mass, cancer cells can also be arranged in strips, and the glandular arrangement should account for more than one-half.","['chest pain', 'nipple inset', 'nipple discharge', 'nipple broken', 'painful pain', 'hepatomegaly', 'lacation disorder', 'breast lumps', 'distance transfer of breast cancer ']",['infectious shock'],"['oncology', 'oncology']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
milk spill,"the most common nipple discharge is a pale yellow serous discharge, which occurs mostly in breast hyperplasia, intraductal papilloma, or breast cancer. purulent nipple discharge is more common in breast inflammation and ductal dilatation.bloody nipple discharge is common in intraductal papilloma or breast cancer.of course, high prolactinosis caused by endocrine disorders can also lead to nipple galactorrhea. it is recommended to go to the hospital for detailed examination to confirm the diagnosis and timely treatment.","do a good job in breastfeeding after childbirth, breastfeeding time should not be too long, such as the emergence of abnormal milk secretion, should be promptly checked, exclude tumor factors, find out the cause, treat as soon as possible. first, it is advisable to eat foods with anti-breast cancer effects, such as hippocampus, cockroach, cobra, sperm whale oil, clam meat, crab, red, clam, oyster, clam meat, kelp, asparagus, stone cauliflower. second, it is advisable to eat foods that enhance immunity and prevent recurrence, including mulberry, kiwi, asparagus, pumpkin, glutinous rice, kidney beans, yam, mushrooms, shrimp, crab, herring, prawns, and snakes. third, swelling should eat glutinous rice, loofah, red beans, medlar, grapes, lychee, medlar, carp, pond carp, carp, loach, stingray, snail. fourth, pain, nipple retraction should eat fennel, chopped green onion, shrimp, sea dragon, scented oil whale, orange cake, grapefruit, medlar. 5. avoid smoking, alcohol, coffee, and cocoa.","in both sexes, prolactinoma is the most secreted tumor in the pituitary gland that produces too much prl.in women, the majority of tumors are microadenomas (<10 mm in diameter), but a small number of large adenomas (>10 mm in diameter) are diagnosed.the incidence of microadenomas in men is very low, because most of them are found late. hyperprolactinemia or galactorrhea can also be caused by taking certain drugs, including phenothiazine, some antihypertensive drugs (especially methyldopa) and opioids. because of the increased trh excitability of tsh and prl secretion, hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea can be produced.hyperprolactinemia with low gonadotropin and hypogonadism is unclear.","['resident doctor', 'yiyin', 'vulva atrophy', 'secondary amenorrhea', 'pelvic mass', 'rare menstruation', 'cushin syndrome']",['stomach ache'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
papillary cystadenocarcinoma,"papillary cystatic adenocarcinoma (papillary cystadenocarcinoma) is relatively rare in parotid tumors, accounting for 5% to 7% of parotid epithelial tumors, and is often considered a subtype of adenocarcinoma.eneroth et al. refer to this type of tumor as ""mucus producing adenopapillary carcinoma"", which is derived from the parotid ductal epithelium.",there are no effective preventive measures for this disease.early detection and early treatment are the key to prevention.,"(1) the gross morphology of the tumor looks like a mixed tumor, which is round or nodular, with no membrane. the tumor section is usually cystic, the inner wall of the cavity is not smooth, and there may be some papillary protrusions or granular.

adrenal crisis,"adrenal crisis refers to a series of clinical symptoms caused by insufficient or absent secretion of adrenocortical hormone by various reasons, which can affect multiple systems.mainly manifested by symptoms caused by adrenocortical hormone deficiency, such as dehydration, blood pressure drop, orthostatic hypotension, collapse, anorexia, vomiting, lack of energy, lethargy and even coma.","patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency should be educated, insist on continuous administration of hormones, and should not be arbitrarily interrupted. in case of stress, it is necessary to increase the dose under the guidance of a physician. if there is upper respiratory tract infection, tooth extraction and other small stress, the hormone will be the amount is doubled until the disease is cured. generally, control is seen within 4 to 5 days. if there is a large stress, such as surgery, myocardial infarction, severe trauma and infection, hydrocortisone should be given to 200~ 300mg / d, the amount of hormone should be increased a few hours before surgery, when the patient goes out to carry out, it is necessary to carry a sufficient amount of hormone for application.","inhibition of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, even if it is stopped for 1 year, its function is still in a low state, especially the response to stress. oyama study 14 patients treated with steroid for a long time before induction of anesthesia, 30 minutes after induction and surgery blood cortisol was measured at 1 h after treatment at 107I18 米g/l (10.7I1.8 米g/dl), 108I15 米g/l (10.8I1.5 米g/dl) and 148I25 米g/l (14.8I2.5 米g/dl). the blood cortisol in 10 patients in the control group was 108I14米g/l (10.8I1.4米g/dl), 175I16米g/l (17.5I1.6米g/dl) and 263I18米g/l, respectively.

pheochromocytoma,"phenochromocytoma (pheo) is a tumor formed by chromaffin cells. extrapyretic pheochromocytoma can occur anywhere from the carotid body to the pelvis.can lead to abnormal blood pressure (often manifested as hypertension) and metabolic disorders, some patients may cause serious heart, brain, kidney damage or sudden high blood pressure caused by chronic hypertension, life-threatening, but such as it can be diagnosed and treated in a timely and early manner, and it is a curable secondary hypertension.","due to the variety of clinical manifestations of patients with pheochromocytoma, the diagnosis is difficult, but the possibility of pheochromocytoma should be considered first in the following situations: 1. patients with paroxysmal or persistent hypertension with headache , palpitations, sweating, pale, chest, abdominal pain, nervousness, anxiety, suddendeath and other symptoms and high metabolic status;2, children with acute or malignant hypertension, adolescents; 3, unexplained shock; high repeated episodes of hypotension; paroxysmal arrhythmia; changes in body position or enlargement, induces a significant increase in blood pressure during urination; 4. sudden increase in blood pressure or shock during surgery, anesthesia, pregnancy, childbirth, and even cardiac arrest those who are exposed to bilateral renal areas or abdomen to induce hypertension; 5, taking conventional antihypertensive drugs, blood pressure is not satisfactory, or only b-adrenergic receptor blockers. the etiology of sporadic pheochromocytoma is still unclear, so there is no clear related prevention. family pheochromocytoma is related to heredity and can be examined in related genetics. 1. in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hypertension, be highly alert to the possibility of the disease, should master its clinical characteristics before early diagnosis, minimize missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. 2. once the diagnosis of the disease is the first choice for surgical treatment. 3. pay attention to keeping the blood pressure relatively stable during the treatment of the disease to avoid accidents.","(a) the cause of the disease pheochromocytoma located in the adrenal gland accounted for 80% to 90%, and mostly one side; extra-adrenal tumors mainly located in the extraperitoneal, adjacent to the abdominal aorta (10% to 15%), a few located special sites such as the renal hilum, hilar, bladder, rectum, etc., benign, malignant accounted for 10%, like most tumors, the etiology of sporadic pheochromocytoma is still unclear, familial pheochromocytoma and heredity relatedly, pheochromocytoma in multiple endocrine neoplasia (men-2a, men-2b) has been reported to have a short arm of chromosome 1 and it has been found that both of them have a chromosome 10 rei proto-oncogene. germ-line mutation, men2a is a mutation in exon ret10, which encodes a cysteine residue in the extracellular protein ligand binding region, thereby affecting the tyrosine kinase receptor on the cell surface. men-2b has a mutation in the rteb proto-oncogene of chromosome 10, which affects the tyrosine kinase catalytic site of the protein-binding region in the cell, and tyrosine kinase is involved in the regulation of cell growth and mutation, resulting in a susceptible population. onset, von hippel-lindau syndrome pheochromocytoma, gene damage exists in the 3p25 ~ 26 vhl gene (also known as tumor suppressor gene), a variety of mutations, three exons (exons 1, 2, 3) can be mutated, it is characterized by nonsense mutation, missense mutation, frameshift mutation or deletion mutation. pheochromocytoma is associated with missense mutation. when the gene is mutated, cell growth is out of control and tumor is formed. vhl gene germ cell line mutation determines vhl. the family's tumor susceptibility and incidence, and the vhl gene somatic cell mutation is related to the malignant tendency of the tumor. in multiple neurofibromatosis (type i and type ii), pheochromocytoma only type i is related to the basic genetic damage of the inactivation mutation of the rf1 gene of chromosome 17, which is also a tumor suppressor gene, which, after loss of expression, can lead to the occurrence of pheochromocytoma and other tumors. (two) pathogenesis 1. pathology pheochromocytoma is derived from the pheochromic tissue of the sympathetic nervous system and is divided into two types: sporadic and familial. the sporadic pheochromocytoma is often single, 80% to 85% of the tumors are located in the adrenal gland, and the right side is slightly more. on the left side, a small number of tumors are located in the chromaffin tissue outside the adrenal gland. familial pheochromocytoma is often multiple, and is often located in the adrenal gland, involving the bilateral adrenal glands, which are rare outside the adrenal gland. in children, the adrenal gland is the incidence of pheochromocytoma in the bilateral adrenal gland is higher. the diameter of pheochromocytoma in the adrenal gland is often less than 10cm, mostly 3~5cm, the average weight is about 10g, and the large tumor occasionally can exceed 1000g. the tumor is mostly round. or elliptical, very few dumbbells; the tumor surface is gray or tan, or variegated, often bleeding, necrosis, cystic or calcification, visible under the light microscope, larger, polygonal the composition of chrome cells, under the electron microscope, there are dense eosinophils rich in epinephrine and norepinephrine around the nucleus. the diameter of malignant pheochromocytoma is larger than that of benign tumors. significant difference, malignant people may have infiltration of the capsule, blood vessels may have tumor thrombus formation, but it is difficult to identify by microscopic observation, mainly to observe whether there is local infiltration and distant metastasis, the main part of metastasis is often liver , bones, lymph nodes and lungs, familial pheochromocytoma is often bilateral hyper-small, multi-centered lesions, the incidence of malignant and recurrence rate is higher than diffuse pheochromocytoma. extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma (or paraganglioma) accounts for 15% to 20% of pheochromocytoma, and extra-adrenal tumors are often less than 5cm in diameter and weigh between 20 and 40g. tumors can be in sympathetic nerves. intra- or extra-segmental, consistent with the anatomical distribution of extra-adrenal pheochromic tissue; mostly in the abdomen, located in front of the retroperitoneal abdominal aorta, left and right lumbar paravertebral space, opening of the inferior mesenteric artery, chromogranin next to the aorta ( zuckerkandl) can also be seen in the carotid body, jugular sinus, suprarenal pole, renal hilum, hilar, between the liver and inferior vena cava, celiac plexus, near the head of the pancreas, axillary or proximal axillary vascular , in the ovary, in the bladder, after the rectum, etc.; the tumor of the chest is often located on the sympathetic trunk after mediastinum, but also in the pericardium or heart; tumors in the cauda equina and other parts are rare, about 20% of extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma is multiple the incidence of malignant extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma is relatively large, manifested as recurrence and distant metastasis after tumor resection, extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma has multiple, multi-focal characteristics, should pay attention to look carefully to prevent omission. like other endocrine gland tumors, the pathological diagnosis of adrenal medullary tumors cannot be based solely on morphological manifestations. in addition to hormone determination and clinical manifestations, attention must be paid to the evaluation of biological behavior (hormone synthesis, secretion and infiltration capacity) of tumor cells. in terms of hormone synthesis and secretion ability, the following hormones can be identified from tumor cells by immunohistochemistry: adrenaline, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, enkephalin, cgrp, crh, vip, pacap, anp, am, ss, neuropeptide y, substance p, galanin, etc., the polyphenol secretion of pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla is generally more obvious than that of the adrenal gland. in genetics, the genetic markers of sporadic pheochromocytoma are unknown, while familial (such as men 2a) have significant genetic defects. recent studies have shown that pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma have a common chromosome. defects, using genome-to-comparison hybridization, found that the copy number changes were similar. both tumors had loss and other changes in 1 cen-p3l (82%) and 11q22-25 (41%), in histopathological morphology. in terms of the diagnosis of simple cell morphology, especially the basis for the identification of benign and malignant, it must be limited by immunohistochemistry. the tumor cells are chromogranin, leu7, s-100 protein positive reaction only indicates that it is the source of extraneural embryonic layer can not identify its benign and malignant, sometimes in the growth of cells, the infiltration behavior is ambiguous. when the diagnosis is difficult, it can be diagnosed by flow cytometry. if it is still difficult, it depends on the long-term follow-up observation. the general histopathological diagnosis principles and methods of this disease can be referred to the diagnostic draft published by the cancer society of the national college of pathologists. adrenal medulla hyperplasia mainly refers to the increase of the number of chromaffin cells, according to the ratio of adrenal medulla / cortical thickness, such as > 1: 10 that there may be medullary hyperplasia, adrenal medulla hyperplasia may be simple or accompanied by men-ii. most of the simple adrenal medulla hyperplasia is bilateral adrenal medulla hyperplasia, a small number of unilateral hyperplasia, it has been reported that vitamin d3 increases the number of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells through its role in promoting mitosis, in addition, 21-hydroxylation in addition to adrenal hyperplasia, the enzyme deficiency has adrenal medullary dysfunction and medullary hyperplasia. the clinical manifestations of adrenal medulla hyperplasia are similar to those of pheochromocytoma, with paroxysmal hypertension and episode hypertensive crisis. blood, urine catecholamine and its metabolite levels can be increased, but b-ultrasound, ct and mri can not find adrenal mass, 131i-mibg can be bilateral or one side (proliferative side) adrenal medulla intake of mibg increased, confirmed diagnosis by pathological examination, the pathological changes are multiple nodular hyperplasia or diffuse hyperplasia, and blood pressure can return to normal after surgery. some immunohistochemical indicators can be used to determine the biological behavior of tumor cells. for example, the rate of monoclonal antibody mib1 positive cells varies greatly in benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, and the positive rate of mib1 in benign tumor cells of the adrenal gland is low (0.81%). ), malignant time is high (3.30%); outside the adrenal gland, this difference is more obvious (0.44% vs 5.1%), so when the mib positive cell rate is >2%, it is highly suspected of malignant pheochromocytoma. 2. biochemical changes (1) synthesis, storage and release of catecholamines: synthesis and release of catecholamines in pheochromocytoma cells are different from chromaffin cells in normal adrenal medulla, but chromogranular granules in pheochromocytoma cells are in morphology and physiologically functionally identical to the chromaffin particles in the normal adrenal medulla, the chromaphilic particles are rich in epinephrine and norepinephrine, but the ratio between the two is not the same in different chromaffin particles, due to adrenaline ( e) there must be a high concentration of glucocorticoids during synthesis. therefore, in addition to the adrenaline in the adrenal gland and the chromatin in the aorta, the tumor cells in other parts can only synthesize norepinephrine. (ne), this feature is helpful for the localization diagnosis of tumors, probably because the feedback inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase is impaired, the synthesis regulation of catecholamines is changed, and the level of catecholamine synthesis by tumor cells is more or less the ground is higher than the normal chromaffin cells, and the pheochromocytoma is not like the normal, adrenal medulla is innervated, the release of catecholamines and nerve impulses inconsistent movements, changes in tumor blood flow, direct compression, chemical and drug stimulation, and an increase in angiotensin-2 can cause catecholamine release in tumor cell tissues, but the mechanism is not well understood. (2) excretion of catecholamines: unlike chromogranular granules (about 85% of adrenaline) in normal adrenal medulla, most of the pheochromocytoma in pheochromocytoma contain more ne than epinephrine, so most of them the patient's urine is dominated by norepinephrine, and all of them are adrenaline, which is clinically characterized by 汕-receptor-exciting syndromes such as tachycardia and hypermetabolism, unless the adrenaline in urine is measured separately. and norepinephrine, most patients can not infer the type of excreted catecholamines from clinical features, because of its atypical clinical manifestations, the secretion and excretion of adrenaline pheochromocytoma is difficult to diagnose, tumor cells only synthesize and secrete the adrenal gland the mechanism of element (e) is unknown. phenylethanolamine-n-methyltransferase (pnmt) is the only rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ne to e. these tumor cells express large amounts of pnmt and are compared with other types of pheochromocytoma. pnmt is expressed only in tumor cells secreting e and is expressed together with 17汐-hydroxylase and its receptor protein, suggesting that pnmt, which controls the amount of adrenaline production, is secreted in the adrenaline. tumor cells were overexpressed, and the reason is the over-expression of egr-1 and cortisol rich content. in patients with familial pheochromocytoma, tumor cells contain large amounts of catecholamines, but levels of catecholamines and catecholamine metabolites in the blood and urine are rarely increased, especially in multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, in plasma and in urine. adrenaline increase is only a biochemical change, generally does not cause clinical symptoms, the mechanism is still unclear, at this time the diagnosis is often very difficult. in addition to the zuckerkandl pheochromocytoma, extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma typically secretes only adenine, adrenaline, but it has been reported that pheochromocytoma in the thoracic cavity can also produce adrenaline, in the early stages of pheochromocytoma, dopamine and the excretion of dopamine metabolites such as high vanillic acid (hva) is often normal. if the excretion of dopamine and hva in the urine increases, it is more likely to be malignant. (3) tumor size and catecholamine level: the size of the tumor is related to the conversion of free catecholamine to catecholamine metabolites. small pheochromocytoma, the concentration of catecholamine in the tumor is low, but its discharge is much, so the vma in urine the proportion of ca is low; on the contrary, large pheochromocytoma, the concentration of catecholamine in the tumor is high, but the discharge is small, the ratio of vma to catecholamine in urine is high, because the small tumor discharge rate is high, so the unmetabolized catecholamine is secreted, which has biological activity. it can also produce clinical manifestations. these tumors are often diagnosed at very small hours. on the contrary, for tumors that can store more catecholamines, catecholamines can be converted into their metabolites in tumors, and less bioactive catecholamines are secreted. before the onset of clinical symptoms, the tumor is already large. understanding the synthesis and metabolic processes of ca will help us to have a clear understanding of ca's biochemical sources, material composition and metabolites, and its ca anabolic pathway. ca plays a role in stimulating receptors in the body. its related adrenergic receptors are divided into 汐, 汕 and da receptors (dacs), which are further divided into 汐1汐2, 汕1汕2 and dac1 dac2 receptors. the physiological response of the body when stimulated. (4) other substances produced by tumors: in addition to the synthesis of adrenaline and ne, pheochromocytoma can also synthesize or secrete some peptides, and these peptides can also be increased in the circulation, including the adrenal cortex. hormone (acth), corticotropin releasing hormone (crh), growth hormone releasing hormone (ghrh), calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp), parathyroid hormone-related peptide (pthrp), atrial natriuretic peptide (anp), it seems that the mechanism of synthesis and secretion of these peptide hormones is unknown, such as vasopressin (vip), neuropeptide substance y (npy), somatostatin, erythropoietin and adrenomedullin (am), 汐-msh, etc. not due to nerve stimulation, may be related to the increased reflex activity of the chromogranin secretory channel. the effect of these peptide hormones on clinical manifestations is not very clear, but some peptides can cause special endocrine syndromes, such as fthrp. secretion can cause secondary hypercalcemia, and increased secretion of erythropoietin leads to secondary polycythemia. 3. familial pheochromocytoma and related diseases (1) multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome: in multiple endocrine neoplasia type i (men-1, wermer syndrome), pheochromocytoma is not common, multiple endocrine neoplasia type ii (men-2a, sipple syndrome) includes pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma and parathyroid adenoma; about 40% to 50% of men-2a individuals can develop pheochromocytoma, it is derived from adrenal medulla hyperplasia, often multiple, bilateral, hyperplastic changes around the tumor [diffuse and / or nodular hyperplasia], extrarenal pheochromocytoma is rare; tumor secreted hormones mainly it is adrenaline, so early clinical symptoms can be atypical, only blood or urine biochemical changes, multiple endocrine neoplasia type iii (men-2b) by ganglion neuroma phenotype (like marfan body type, multiple mucosal neuroma ), medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma, the incidence of pheochromocytoma is 40% to 50%. (2) von hippel-lindau syndrome (vhl syndrome): von hippel-lindau syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease, consisting of retinal hemangioma, central vascular reticuloma, kidney cancer, kidney and pancreas cysts and multiple cystadenoma, the incidence of pheochromocytoma accounts for 10% to 20%, often multiple, the incidence of pheochromocytoma in different families is different, up to 90% in some families and it happens often earlier. the etiology and pathogenesis of this syndrome have been basically ascertained. the chromosome 3p25 region contains tumor suppressor gene (tsg). vascular tumors (benign) and cysts (liver, kidney, pancreas) can be caused by mutation or deletion of tsg. etc.) and the formation of cystadenoma, about 70% of patients may be associated with renal clear cell carcinoma, the apparent rate of pheochromocytoma varies greatly, but in recent years there have been more reports that the intrinsic easy to merge with endolymphatic sac endolymphtic sac tumors are one of the important causes of tinnitus and deafness. clinically, when encountering familial retina, hemangioblastoma of the brain tissue or multiple pancreatic cysts, it is possible to think of vhl syndrome, but with epididymis alone or renal cysts cannot be diagnosed as vhl. for those without a family history, they must have two or more retinal and/or brain vascular reticuloma, or have a vascular reticuloma with a visceral tumor. the clinical diagnosis of vhl can only be made. the diagnosis depends on the molecular biological examination of tsg gene mutation or the deletion of 3p 25 region. all family members must be screened for dna or 3p 25 deletion. tests, positive carriers must undergo close follow-up observations. the tsg gene (also known as the vhl gene) contains three exons encoding two mrnas. about 20% of patients with southerner analysis can detect germline mutations (involving all cells), and 27% have nonsense mutations or frameshifts. (frameshift) mutation, the positive detection rate of vhl family members is about 80%, family pheochromocytoma (vhl2 type) accounted for about 7% to 20%, vhl in most vhl 2 family, the gene is non-sense mutation, while the vhl gene of the vhl type 1 family (without pheochromocytoma) is completely or partially deficient (due to the early appearance of the stop codon), and the clinical heterogeneity of vhl is derived from genetic defects and penetrance. heterogeneity, sometimes associated with the presence of chimeric chromosomes in tumor cells. the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nervous system originate from the sympathetic neuronal cells in the embryonic stage, and become differentiated into sympathetic ganglion cells and chromaffin cells. these cells are abnormally differentiated to form neuroblastoma, ganglionoma and pheo. differentiation and evolution process. (3) multiple neurofibromatosis and other related diseases: there are two subtypes of multiple neurofibromatosis (type i and type ii), and pheochromocytoma is only associated with type i, and its incidence is in multiple neurofibromas. the population varies in height, 1% to 50%, in the carney complex. it is often characterized by functional extra-adrenal paraganglioma, and often associated with pheochromocytoma in sturge-weber syndrome. . yokoyma et al used the metoclopramide (gastric ampoules) test as a challenge test for suspicious patients to identify the nature of adrenal masses. of the 7 patients with pheochromocytoma, 3 were positive, 3 were negative, and 1 was false negative. its sensitivity and specificity are similar to those of 24h urinary catecholamine and mibg, but the specificity is 100%. the negative result is not the test insensitivity, but the disease itself has heterogeneous biological characteristics. it was thought that it was considered to be methicillin. amine (gastric ampoules) can promote the secretion of avp (adh), but coiro et al used 1 mg intravenous injection of metoclopramide (gastric ampoules), no change in plasma avp, hsu et al found that pheochromocytoma (6/7) showed a positive reaction. in addition to the increase in blood pressure, it was more diagnostic to observe changes in plasma and urinary catecholamine before and after the test, but drugs that interfere with ca secretion should be discontinued before the test.","['shock', 'functional tremor', 'arrhythmia', 'nausea', 'thinness', 'heart enlargement', 'heart palpitations with hypertension', 'catecholamine secretion excess']",['hypertensive encephalopathy'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

mild to moderate acidosis can be classified as moderate; severe refers to ketoacidosis accompanied by coma, or although there is no coma, but the carbon dioxide binding force is less than 10mmol / l, the latter is easy to enter a coma.","dka can be prevented. in the treatment of diabetes, publicity and education on diabetes knowledge should be strengthened, and prevention should be emphasized. especially for type 1 diabetes, strict insulin therapy system should be emphasized, insulin therapy should not be interrupted or insulin dose reduced, and insulin should be must pay attention to proper preservation (2 ~ 8 ～ c), especially in the summer high temperature season, in order to avoid failure, patients with type 2 diabetes should be alert to prevent various causes, especially infection and stress, whether it is type 1 or type 2 diabetes, even during illness, such as fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, etc., can not stop or interrupt insulin therapy due to less eating, diabetes with mild infection, extra-hospital treatment, should pay attention to monitoring blood sugar, blood ketone or ketone body; in the case of myocardial infarction, surgical acute abdomen surgery and severe infection, insulin should be given in time. patients with severe type 2 diabetes who have failed oral hypoglycemic drugs should be switched to insulin therapy in time to prevent ketosis. in short, dka can prevent it. prevention of dka is more effective and important than rescuing the already affected.","it is an important cause of dka, including the respiratory system, urinary system and skin infections, and the incidence is high in winter and spring. acute infection is a complication of dka. it is a cause and effect with dka, forming a vicious circle and increasing the complexity of diagnosis and treatment. sex. such as discontinuation of drugs (especially insulin) treatment, insufficient drug and drug resistance, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes who discontinue or reduce the dose of insulin treatment, often cause dka, type 2 diabetes patients take large amounts of phenformin for a long time, especially dka is easily induced in liver and kidney function; large doses of thiazide diuretics have also been reported. in recent years, some patients have convinced that there is no definitive treatment or ""drug"", and they have given up scientifically recognized formal treatment. in particular, patients with type 1 diabetes, even with insulin discontinuation, are more likely to induce dka. out of control of the diet and/or gastrointestinal diseases such as overeating, too sweet (too much sugar) or deficiency, alcoholism, or vomiting, diarrhea, etc., can aggravate metabolic disorders and induce dka. such as severe trauma, anesthesia, surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, mental stimulation, and myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents, elevated levels of glucocorticoids due to stress, increased sympathetic nervous system excitability, and eating disorders, easy to induce ketoacidosis. the main link in the pathogenesis of dka is due to insulin deficiency (figure 1) and insulin counter-regulating hormone (such as glucosamine), leading to glucose metabolism disorders, blood glucose can not be used normally, resulting in increased blood sugar, increased fat decomposition, increased blood ketones and a series of changes such as metabolic acidosis and water, electrolyte imbalance, such as glucagon, adrenaline, glucocorticoids and growth hormone, among which glucagon has the strongest effect, pancreatic glucose excessive secretion is the main cause of dka. due to the double barrier of insulin and glycemic hormone secretion, the function of glucose running carrier in patients is reduced, the glycogen synthesis and sugar utilization rate are decreased, glycogen decomposition and gluconeogenesis are enhanced, blood sugar significantly increased, at the same time, due to disorders of fat metabolism, increased levels of free fatty acids, a large number of precursors for the production of ketone bodies, eventually formed ketoacidosis. in dka, the pathophysiological changes that occur in the body are mainly reflected in the following aspects: 1. hyperglycemia: dka patients have a moderate increase in blood glucose, usually 300 ~ 500mg / dl, unless the renal insufficiency, or more than 500mg / dl, causing high blood sugar in patients including insulin secretion decreased, the body's response to insulin decreased, the secretion of glycemic hormone increased, as well as dehydration, blood concentration and other factors. the effects of hyperglycemia on the body include: 1 affecting the extracellular fluid permeation zone. generally, the osmolality of 5.6mmol/l (100mg/dl) increases by 5.5mmol/l (5.5mosm/kg), extracellular fluid. hypertonicity causes intracellular fluid to move outside the cell, dehydration of the cell, and dehydration of the cell will lead to dysfunction of the corresponding organ, 2 causing osmotic diuresis, and increased blood glucose by dka can be compared with normal 5.5 to 11.1 mmol/ (l{min) is 5 to 10 times higher, and the maximum capacity of the proximal tubule to recover sugar is 16.7 to 27.8 mmol/(l{min). excess sugar is excreted by the kidneys, taking away moisture and electrolytes, further causing water and salt metabolism disorders. 2. ketoacidosis and/or acidosis (1) composition and metabolism of ketone bodies: ketone bodies are products of incomplete oxidation of fat 汕, including acetoacetic acid, 汕-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone, among which acetoacetate it is a strong organic acid, which can react with ketone body powder; 汕-hydroxybutyric acid is a acetoxyacetate reduction product, also a strong organic acid, which is the largest in the ketone body, accounting for 70% of the total ketone body; acetone it is the decarboxylation product of acetoacetate, the amount is the least, neutral, no renal threshold, can be discharged from the respiratory tract, normal human blood ketone body does not exceed 10mg / dl, ketoacidosis can be increased 50 to 100 times, urine ketone positive. it can be seen from fig. 3 that the acetylated coa, a product of fatty acid 汕 oxidation, is both a precursor of the ketone body and an inevitable pathway for the elimination of the ketone body. the acetyl coa is combined with the oxaloacetate, a product of sugar metabolism, to form citric acid, and then enters the tricarboxylic acid. if it is recycled, if there is not enough sugar metabolite oxaloacetate, the elimination of the ketone body is an obstacle. (2) increased lipolysis: the main causes of fatty acid breakdown in dka patients include severe insulin deficiency, inhibition of fat breakdown, sugar utilization disorders, increased compensatory fat mobilization, and growth hormone, glucagon and cortisol in dka. caused by factors such as increased hormone breakdown of fat. (3) hyperketolemia: dka patients have increased fat decomposition, producing a large amount of free fatty acids and triglycerides. a large number of free fatty acids are 汕-oxidized in the liver and coupled with coa and atp to form acetyl coa. coa increases the ketone body produced in the liver, which exceeds the ability of normal surrounding tissues to oxidize and causes hyperketosis. (4) acidemia and ketoacidosis: both 汕-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in the ketone body are strong acids, and the increase in blood ketone increases the concentration of organic acids in the blood (normal 6mmol/l), while a large amount of organic acids when excreted from the kidney, except for a small amount of free state or by the renal tubular secretion [h] neutralization and elimination, most of the bases are combined with the body to form a salt and eliminated, resulting in a large loss of alkali storage in the body and acidosis, when blood typical acidosis breathing (kussmaul respiration) can occur when the ph drops to 7.2. when ph <7.0, it can cause central paralysis or severe muscle weakness or even death. in addition, acidemia affects the oxygenation of hemoglobin from tissue, resulting in hypoxia. aggravate the deterioration of the general condition. the degree of perception of dka varies widely, regardless of whether the state of consciousness is semi-awake or coma. when plasma hco-3 P 9.0mmol/l, it is considered to be regarded as diabetic ketoacidosis and coma. , dkac), when the blood hco-3 drops below 5.0mmol / l, the prognosis is extremely serious. 3. dehydration: dka has a significant increase in blood sugar, and a large number of acid roots, osmotic diuresis and acid loss, plus deep breathing loss and possible vomiting, diarrhea caused by diarrhea and other factors, it can lead to the occurrence of dehydration. the causes of dehydration are: 1 osmotic diuresis caused by hyperglycemia; 2 protein and fat decomposition increase, a large amount of acidic metabolites are taken away when water is removed; 3 patients have insufficient water intake, especially in elderly patients, caused by dehydration insufficient blood volume, decreased blood pressure and even circulatory failure. 4. electrolyte disorder: dka, due to osmotic diuresis, reduced intake and vomiting, transfer of water inside and outside the cell into the blood, blood concentration, etc. can lead to electrolyte imbalance, clinically measured blood electrolyte levels can be high, can be low, also it can be normal. there is no fixed change of blood na in dka. it is generally normal or reduced. in the early stage, due to the extracellular fluid migration, it can cause low-dilution na. generally, for every 5.6mmol/l increase in blood glucose, blood na can decrease by 2.7mmol/l. loss of blood na may increase due to diuretic and ketone excretion, but if the water loss exceeds na, the blood na may increase, and the blood k may decrease, although the tissue decomposition is increased by dka and a large amount of intracellular k is removed. the blood k value is not low, but its overall potassium is still low, because: 1 osmotic diuresis causes a large amount of k loss; 2dka when renal tubular secretion [h] and system [nh4] function is impaired, renal tubular na-k exchange increase; 3 vomiting and insufficient intake, therefore, as long as the renal function is not impaired in dka patients, potassium is required for treatment. in dka, due to the increase of cell catabolism, the loss of phosphorus also increases, and hypophosphatemia can occur clinically. in recent years, special attention has been paid to the decomposing of dka patients due to increased cell decomposition, the organic binding of phosphorus in cells will be destroyed, and phosphorus is released from cells. urinary discharge, about 11% of dka patients with low blood phosphorus, phosphorus deficiency can cause red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerol reduction, and affect oxygen from hemoglobin dissociation caused by tissue hypoxia. in addition, it should also be noted that dka may cause a false decrease in water-soluble electrolyte components (such as blood sodium) due to increased blood lipid levels. 5. tissue hypoxia: dka with abnormal oxygen system, hyperglycemia caused by increased glycosylated hemoglobin (ghb) content in red blood cells, enhanced affinity of hemoglobin and oxygen; intracellular 2,3-diphosphoglycerate deficiency in phosphorus deficiency (2,3 -dpg) reduces, the blood oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left, both of which lead to a decrease in oxygen release, resulting in tissue hypoxia, but due to the bohr effect, that is, the ph value decreases during acidosis, the hemoglobin and oxygen affinity decrease, but also the tissue hypoxia is improved to some extent.","['coma', 'cardiotoxicity', 'sweet smell in exhalation', 'appetite loss', 'drowsiness', 'abdominal pain', 'dizziness', 'living', 'disgusting', 'gastrointestinal tract symptom']","['brain edema', 'hypoglycemia', 'adult respiratory distress syndrome', 'pulmonary edema', 'arrhythmia', 'myocardial infarction', 'shock', 'death death', 'cerebral thrombosis', 'pulmonary embolism ', 'acute renal failure', 'sepsis', 'diffuse intravascular coagulation', 'lactic acidosis', 'acute pancreatitis', 'acute gastric dilatation']","['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
diabetic foot,"diabetic foot refers to the disease state in which the lower limb protection function is reduced due to neuropathy in the foot of diabetic patients, and the disease of ulcer and gangrene is caused by microvascular dysfunction caused by insufficient perfusion of arteries. the diabetic foot is a serious complication of diabetes. it is one of the important reasons for the disability and even death of diabetic patients, which not only causes pain to the patients, but also adds a huge economic burden.","the principle of prevention and care of diabetic foot should firstly control diabetes after strict diagnosis of diabetes, strictly control hyperglycemia (including rational distribution of diet and hypoglycemic drugs and insulin application), and control hyperlipidemia and various factors leading to early arteriosclerosis. both should be used as a long-term task to prevent diabetic gangrene, so that the blood vessels and neuropathy develop slowly, lighter, less, and carefully care for and prevent possible lesions in the foot, so do: 1. first it is necessary to pay enough attention to the mind, and regard foot care as an integral part of life and prevent it from happening. 2. develop good foot hygiene habits. (1) wash your feet with warm water or soft soap every day to keep your feet clean. (2) test the water temperature by hand before washing the feet (the water temperature is suitable for putting the water on the skin of the back of the hand). it is absolutely not possible to use hot water to soak the feet and cause burns to avoid skin damage. (3) after washing the feet, dry them with a dry towel, including the toes, and do not rub them with a coarse cloth to cause skin abrasions. (4) to protect the skin from softness and cleft palate, apply skin oil, cream, cream, but do not apply it to the toe. (5) it is not advisable to use talcum powder for water absorption for a long time. in order to prevent the pores from being blocked, it is not suitable to wear airtight nylon polyester socks. cotton yarn socks or wool socks should be worn. (6) check the heel, sole, toe seam, whether there are ulcers, cracks, abrasions and blisters, etc. if you find a foot lesion, you should seek medical advice promptly, properly handle it, and do not wait for it, and delay treatment. opportunity. (7) corns, cockroaches can not be cut by themselves, nor can they be corroded with chemicals, and should be treated by a doctor. (8) shoes and socks should be suitable, loose, change socks every day, it is best to have two pairs of shoes to replace, so that the shoes remain dry, before wearing shoes should check the sand crystal particles, nails and other debris in the shoes, so as not to appear on the soles of the feet broken. (9) it is not advisable to wear pointed shoes, high heels, sandals with exposed toes and heels, and avoid walking barefoot or wearing slippers. (10) do not use hot water bottle, kettle or electric blanket to keep warm in the cold winter, so as to avoid burns on the foot. (11) the cleft palate is not covered with tape, and the fungal infection of the foot should be treated in time. (12) avoid alcohol and tobacco, which is beneficial for the prevention and treatment of blood vessels and neuropathy. (13) try to avoid foot injury, prevent frostbite, crush, and choose appropriate physical exercise programs to minimize the risk factors of injury.","many foot complications in diabetic patients result from sensory neuropathy and mild autonomic and motor neuropathy. among them, sensory neuropathy combined with excessive mechanical stress is the main initiating factor causing foot ulcers and infections. inflammation and tissue damage are the result of a certain degree of repeated stress acting on a particular area that loses sensation. pressure or shear from the ground, shoes or other adjacent toes causes ulceration, which is often exacerbated by the presence of bony due to the lack of normal neuroprotective mechanisms. the autonomic nervous system lesions cause normal skin perspiration regulation, skin temperature regulation, and loss of blood regulation, resulting in reduced local tissue flexibility, thick sputum formation, and more fragility and cracking. in addition, the loss of normal wicking ability blocks the rehydration of local tissues, causing further destruction of the tissue, making the deep tissue more susceptible to bacterial colonization. motor neuropathy also plays a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic foot, and the contracture of the internal muscle of the foot causes a typical claw-toed deformity. over-extension of the metatarsophalangeal joint has also been shown to directly increase the pressure on the humeral head, making the site more susceptible to ulceration. the proximal toe joint flexion causes an increased risk of ulceration of the dorsal joint of the interphalangeal joint and the metatarsal tip, and vascular lesions make the damaged tissue difficult to heal. autonomic dysfunction leads to destruction of skin and soft tissue, causing invasion of foreign bacteria. changes in chemical tropism lead to inefficient white blood cell responses. in addition, hyperglycemia, decreased oxygen partial pressure, and malnutrition can collectively trigger tissue edema, acid accumulation, hypertonicity, and inefficient anaerobic metabolism. this type of environment is suitable for bacterial growth and hinders the function of white blood cells. in addition, vascular disease can cause restricted transport of antibiotics, further reducing the efficiency of bacterial clearance, leading to local soft tissue infections and even the formation of osteomyelitis. for progressive weight-bearing joint destructive lesions. neurotrauma theory believes that loss of pain and proprioception after repeated mechanical damage or single trauma can lead to charcot joint disease. neurovascular theory believes that increased blood supply in the lesion area caused by autonomic dysfunction leads to bone resorption and the strength is weakened, and in turn, repeated trauma causes bone destruction and instability. motor neuropathy causes contracture of the intrinsic muscle of the foot, resulting in a typical claw toe deformity.","['dry toe necrosis at the toe', 'chronic ulcer', 'easy to occur in the extremities...', 'diabetic foot lesions', 'limb ischemia', 'toe end dry black', 'diabetes ', 'abscess']",['diabetes gangrene'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['symptomatic treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'chinese medicine treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
vitamin c deficiency,"long-term lack of vitamin c (ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid) caused by the total disease, is currently rare, but in the northern pastoral areas lacking vegetables, fruits, or urban, townships, artificial feeding, neglected complementary food supplements, especially in rural remote areas, still due to improper feeding causes the disease.since pauling published the relationship between cold and vitamin c in 1970, the problems related to the function of vitamin c in the body and the high-dose clinical application have attracted the attention of many scholars.","high levels of vitamin c in breast milk are one of the reasons for emphasizing human breastfeeding. the diet of pregnant women and lactating mothers should include vitamin c-rich foods such as fresh vegetables and fruits, or vitamin c tablets dissolved in water and sugar, and their vitamin c needs. the amount is about 80-100mg or more per day, which can ensure that the fetus and the baby get enough ascorbic acid. zhufu (1936) has done experiments, as long as the daily intake of cabbage and white radish is 0.5kg each, which is contained in breast milk. the concentration of vitamin c can be as high as 60 mg/l (6 mg/dl). 2 to 4 weeks after birth, the newborn should be supplemented with a diet containing more vitamin c and can be digested by the newborn, such as fresh orange juice, tomato juice, cabbage soup, radish juice, etc., starting from april to may. mud, artificially fed babies should be supplemented with appropriate amount of vitamin c every day. the normal daily supply of vitamin c is 30mg for children, 30 to 35mg for young children, 40 to 60mg for older children, and 100mg for premature infants. according to the recommendation of 1988, vitamin c is consumed more when it is sick, and should be given a larger dose. according to the above treatment, the mild pain and local pain are usually relieved within 1 to 2 days, the appetite is improved, the lower limbs can be active after about 4 to 5 days, the symptoms disappear after 7 to 10 days, the body weight is gradually increased, and the local tenderness is about 3 weeks. complete elimination, while capillary fragility also returned to normal, megaloblastic anemia after retreatment of vitamin c and folic acid reticulocytes significantly increased, bone lesions and subperiosteal hemorrhage caused by the recovery of hematoma takes a long time, heavy for several months disappear, even if the bone lesions are very heavy, it is easy to recover, and no deformity will occur. however, if left untreated, scurvy children may suffer from malnutrition, bleeding or infection and death. 1. choose foods rich in vitamin c: the main source of human vitamin c is fresh vegetables and fruits; only a small amount of liver and kidney in animal foods, so there should be enough fresh vegetables in the diet, especially green leafy vegetables. if you can eat some fruits regularly, it will help prevent the deficiency of vitamin c. 2. improve cooking methods and reduce vitamin c loss: vitamin c is very soluble in water; sensitive to oxygen, especially iron, copper ions are more susceptible to oxidation damage, unstable to alkali, but quite acidic stable, therefore, when cooking vegetables, first wash and cut, cut and fry, try to shorten the exposure time in the air, stir-fry without copper. in higher plants, at least five enzyme systems are known to catalyze the oxidative destruction of vitamin c. they are vitamin c oxidase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, cytochrome oxidase and laccase. except for peroxidase, they are all copper-containing metalloenzymes. these oxidase systems are abundant in vegetables, especially cucumbers and cabbages. therefore, during the storage and transportation of vegetables, vitamin c often has varying degrees of damage, but these enzymes it is more heat-tolerant than vitamin c. therefore, during the cooking process of vegetables, it is emphasized that the fire is fast-fried. when the soup is made, the soup is opened, in order to quickly destroy these enzymes to reduce the loss of vitamin c. on the other hand, the polyphenolic compounds contained in plants have protective effects against the oxidative destruction of vitamin c. for example, rutin, quercetin and related flavonoids have such a role, they can not only make vitamin c in food. stable, and can play a role in stabilizing vitamin c in the intestines, especially in the intestines of patients without stomach acid or low stomach acid. 3. use wild vegetables, wild fruits and vitamin preparations: many wild vegetables, wild fruits are rich in vitamin c, such as medlar, purslane, malan head, medlar, wild leek, mustard, etc., vitamin c content can be higher than ordinary vegetables several times to 10 times; the pear c, pomegranate, sour willow, jujube, kiwi and sakura in the wild fruit can be 50 to 100 times higher than the average citrus, which is a good source of vitamin c. in fresh vegetables, vitamins can be used in large quantities in the country, and can be used appropriately.","(1) causes of the disease such as proper nutrition of the pregnant mother, the child has a suitable vitamin c reserve at birth, and the plasma vitamin c content of the cord blood is 2 to 4 times higher than that of the mother plasma, so the infants under 3 months have less incidence, but such as the pregnant mother lack of vitamin c in the diet, newborns can also suffer from scurvy, normal human milk contains about 40 ~ 70mg / l (4 ~ 7mg / dl) of vitamin c, can meet the needs of the average baby, vitamin c content in human milk and lactating vitamin c is proportional to the number of vitamin c, such as the lack of vitamin c in the mother's diet, the baby can suffer from scurvy, fresh animal milk contains less vitamin c than human milk, the content of milk is generally only 1/4 of human milk, after storage, disinfection after the procedures such as bacteria and dilution, there are few deposits. therefore, infants fed with milk, goat milk or unfortified milk powder, milk cake, batter, etc., if they do not supplement vitamin c, fruits or vegetables on time, are prone to scurvy. scurvy in older children is caused by the lack of fresh vegetables and fruits in the diet. when the metabolic rate increases, the vitamin c requirement increases. when the growth is active, the vitamin c content in the body tissue decreases sharply. the premature infants grow faster and faster. the vitamin c requirement is relatively larger than that of normal infants, and should be supplemented more. hot sexually transmitted diseases, acute and chronic infectious diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, tuberculosis, etc., vitamin c needs increased, such as long-term illness, and did not increase the intake of vitamin c, easy to be complicated by the severity of bad blood disease. such as long-term intake of a large amount of vitamin c, its catabolism and renal excretion increased to reduce plasma vitamin c concentration, such as sudden withdrawal of large amounts of vitamin c, can occur scurvy, long-term application of large amounts of vitamin c during pregnancy, even after birth, even after birth ingestion of regular amounts of vitamin c may still cause scurvy. vitamin c is essential for the formation of normal collagen in the human body. vitamin c cannot be synthesized in the human body and needs to be taken from the diet. vitamin c is widely found in fruits and vegetables. the fruits are tannins, grapes, and berries. rich in content, vegetables are green leafy vegetables, sprouted vegetables or beans, tubers, potato content, human adrenal gland and eye crystals contain a particularly high amount of vitamin c, vitamin c is very soluble in water, there is a strong reducibility, easily damaged in the following situations: 1 alkaline environment; 2 trace copper; 3 vegetables are smashed, cut, squeezed, and released ascorbate oxidase after tearing; 4 heating boiling time is too long; 5 system the prepared dishes are placed too long. the structure of vitamin c is similar to monosaccharide. it is generally considered to be an important cofactor for prolylhydroxylase and lysylhydroxylase, which are essential for collagen biosynthesis, and can enhance various hydroxylases and oxidation. the activity of the enzyme, due to its reversibility of oxidation-reduction ability, is active in microsomal electron transport, plays an important role in preventing collagen depolymerization and maintaining matrix integrity, and can convert folic acid into tetrahydrofolate, which promotes the maturation of red blood cells; reduces ferric iron to divalent iron, which facilitates intestinal absorption of iron and synthesis of hemoglobin and formation of ferritin in the liver, and promotes certain adrenal and pituitary hormones. synthesis of immunoglobulins and neurotransmitters. some aromatic amino acids require vitamin c to participate, so tyrosineuria may occur in scurvy; in the neonatal period, especially in low-weight children, transient tyrosine is too high; premature infants are fed with high-protein emulsion a large amount of tyrosine and phenylalanine are often excreted in the urine, and these conditions can be corrected by vitamin c. vitamin c deficiency can lead to collagen fiber formation disorders, decreased intercellular binding, stagnant dentin and bone-like tissue formation, capillary hemorrhage, delayed wound healing, folic acid and iron metabolism disorders leading to anemia and a series of lesions. (b) the pathogenesis of vitamin c and collagen synthesis is closely related, vitamin c deficiency, due to collagen synthesis barriers, resulting in wounds, ulcers are not easy to heal, bones, teeth, etc. are easy to break, fall off; capillary fragility increases, causing skin , mucous membranes, muscle bleeding and other symptoms of vitamin c deficiency. because vitamin c is closely related to collagen synthesis, the pathological changes of vitamin c deficiency caused by vitamin c deficiency are mainly in the connective tissue between cells, especially in collagen, such as growing bone, teeth and blood vessels, etc., the lesions in the bone are mainly slow growth, the cartilage matrix can not be normal calcification, bleeding can be seen in the bone of the cartilage, the backbone joint, the trabecular bone fracture of the cartilage matrix, sometimes dislocation, separation or osteophyte embedding, subperiosteal hemorrhage adults are rare, but they are common in infants with vitamin c deficiency. capillary hemorrhage due to loose adhesion of periosteum can cause large periosteum to be released. this subperiosteal hemorrhage is most common at the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the humerus, and both ends of the tibia. at the junction of the middle ribs and costal cartilage, the capillaries of the skin become brittle, resulting in bruises, ecchymoses and hematoma. the bleeding of the gums can cause swelling of the gums, fragile tissue or even gangrene, and loose teeth can occur due to alveolar bone absorption; children's abnormal tooth development, minimal matrix formation, and sponge-like dentin. the main lesion is due to the lack of collagen causing bleeding and bone changes. when vitamin c is deficient, the main components of collagen, hydroxyproline and chondroitin sulfate, reduce the formation of collagen fibers. the following lesions may occur: 1 due to the formation of connective tissue, the lack of binding between capillary endothelial cells, resulting in capillary fragility and increased wall permeability, can be in the skin, mucosa, subperiosteal, joint cavity and intramuscular bleeding, 2 bones lesions: mostly at the rib cartilage junction and long bone end, especially in the vicinity of the wrist, knee and ankle joint, due to the formation of the matrix, osteoblasts can no longer form bone-like tissue between normal cells, cartilage ossification however, the calcination in the cartilage matrix continues, characterized by temporary accumulation of calcareous calcium in the metaphysis, formation of a temporary calcification zone dense and thickening, inhibition of osteogenesis, formation of bone tissue, formation of trabecular bone becomes brittle easy to fold, the metaphyseal bone is fragile, often leading to fracture and osteophyte separation, the original cortical bone and cancellous bone internal bone atrophy, generalized bone atrophy, loosening of the epicardium, subperiosteal hemorrhage due to bleeding tendency, 3 tooth lesions: hyperemia and edema of the gums, degeneration of the dentate cell layer, loose teeth due to collagen deficiency, lesions of the gums the beginning is the growth of gingival papilla hyperplasia and granulation tissue, and then gradually necrosis. this lesion is common in children who have teething. in severe cases, there may be skeletal muscle degeneration, cardiac hypertrophy, myelosuppression and adrenal atrophy.","['bleeding tendency', 'point bleeding', 'gum hemorrhage', 'inflammation', 'stool blood', 'cortical thinning', 'calcification', 'gingivitis', 'nose bleeding']",['pneumonia'],['nutrition section'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

vitamin e deficiency,"vitamin e deficiency (vitaminedeficiency) is a disease caused by vitamin e deficiency, which causes symptoms related to the human body. vitamin e: vitamin e plays the most extensive role in the human body, and is larger than any nutrient. therefore, it has a ""guardian"". it is said to have good antioxidant properties in the body, that is, to reduce cell aging.maintaining the integrity of red blood cells, promoting cell synthesis, anti-pollution, anti-infertility, and occupying an important role in human nutrition, premature infants lack vitamin e can cause hemolytic anemia.","foods rich in vitamin e: malt, soy, vegetable oil, nuts, brussels sprouts, green leafy vegetables, spinach, nutrient-added flour, whole wheat, unrefined cereal products, eggs. nutritional supplements: you can buy fat-soluble capsules and water-soluble tablets, generally sell 100-1500 iu of vitamin e, water-soluble vitamin e is suitable for people who do not eat greasy food or eat more oily food can cause skin lesions people are more suitable for middle-aged people over 40 years old. the average daily intake is 200-1200 iu, about 0.05 mg/d for dairy-fed, and 1.5 mg/d for other foods. for premature infants with a body weight of less than 1500 g and children with fat malabsorption, it is best to use water-soluble vitamin e 5 mg / d to prevent deficiency. vitamin e is usually non-toxic. when taking high doses (more than 1200 international units per day), it can cause adverse reactions to nausea, flatulence, diarrhea and rapid heartbeat. american medical expert robert advises: long-term use large doses of vitamin e can cause various diseases, the most serious of which are: thrombophlebitis or pulmonary embolism, or both, because large doses of vitamin e can cause platelet aggregation and formation; blood pressure rises, withdrawal after the blood pressure can be reduced or returned to normal; both men and women can have breast hypertrophy; headache, dizziness, dizziness, blurred vision, muscle weakness; skin cracking, cheilitis, angular cheilitis, urticaria; diabetes or angina symptoms significantly worse; hormone metabolism disorder, prothrombin decreased; blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased; platelet increase and vitality increased and immune function decreased, the most obvious toxic effect is the antagonistic effect of vitamin k and enhanced oral coumarin anticoagulant the effect of this can lead to significant bleeding. consult your health advisor before taking vitamin e if you have: if you have high blood pressure or if you are taking anticoagulants, the following acetone coumarin sodium or acetone benzyl hydroxycoumarin. if vitamin e is taken with acetone benzyl hydroxycoumarin (a blood clotting agent), it will increase the possibility of abnormal bleeding. a cholesterol-lowering drug called bile acid chelating agent (such as colestipol and cholestyramine) reduces vitamin e. absorption, vitamin e will interact with cyclosporine, a drug that treats cancer, reducing the efficacy of both.","the amount of vitamin e stored in the body is related to the birth weight and gestational age of the baby. the lower the body weight, the smaller the gestational age and the less the storage, because the vitamin e in the newborn is mostly obtained from the mother in the second trimester of pregnancy. therefore, the storage of vitamin e in the body of immature children is lower than that of normal term infants. ingested vitamin e, absorbed in the small intestine, requires the help of bile and pancreatic juice, when indigestion, steatorrhea, chronic liver disease, pancreatic cystic fibrosis and biliary obstruction, as well as less bile salt synthesis in premature infants, trypsin activity insufficient, etc., can affect the absorption of vitamin e in the intestine. when dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) increase, vitamin e requirements also increase, because vitamin e can prevent pufa peroxidation; if the proportion of vitamin e and pufa in the diet is inappropriate (ratio should be 0.4 to 0.5), causes a deficiency of vitamin e.","['incapable', 'hair split', 'hemolytic anemia', 'atcoxia', 'vitamin e deficiency', 'teeth yellowing', 'prostatic hypertrophy']","['atherosclerosis', 'anemia', 'cataract', 'myopia', 'mentalty', 'neonatal edema', 'neonatal scleredema', 'intracranial hemorrhage']",['nutrition section'],"['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
surgical sebaceous cyst,"sebaceous gland cysts, commonly known as ""powder tumors"", refer to the formation of cysts in the glands due to the accumulation of sebaceous glands after obstruction of the sebaceous gland ducts.this is the most common kind of benign tumor of the skin. many people have had the experience of long powdery tumors, especially those who are in a period of strong growth and development.","powder tumor is a benign tumor, generally does not malignant, but usually surgical resection is good. if left untreated, the cyst rupture will temporarily subside, but it will form scars and is prone to recurrence.","the glandular glands of the sebaceous glands are blocked for various reasons, resulting in the accumulation of sebaceous glands to form a cyst.","['cyst acne', 'blackhead acne']",['adenocarcinoma'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

neonatal hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia,"neonatal hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia: disorders of glucose metabolism are extremely common in the neonatal period.due to the difference between the method of collecting blood samples and detecting blood glucose, the definition of neonatal hypoglycemia is confusing. the hypoglycemia index determined by most scholars is: full blood glucose <1.67mmol/l (30mg/) within 3 days of full-term birth. dl), <2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) after 3 days; <1.1 mmol/l (20 mg/dl) within 3 days after birth, <2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) after 1 week; current trend whole blood glucose <2.2 mmol>7.0 mmol/l (125 mg/dl), or plasma sugar >8.12 to 8.40 mmol/l (145-150 mg/dl).","how to improve the monitoring of blood sugar should be paid attention to by clinicians, and prevention should be the main. early diagnosis and timely treatment can reduce the incidence and reduce brain damage. 1. for neonates prone to hypoglycemia, blood glucose should be monitored at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 hours after birth, and hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia should be discovered sooner or later. 2, for low birth weight infants, high-risk children can eat as soon as possible after birth, start feeding syrup or milk 2 to 4 hours after birth, can not be fed by oral or nasal feeding, intravenous infusion of glucose to maintain nutrition. 3, gastrointestinal nutrition, pay attention to supplement amino acids and fat milk when adding calories, glucose should not be too high. 4, for high-risk children, premature infants should control the rate of glucose infusion, not 8mg / (kg { min), and do blood glucose monitoring, such as increased should immediately reduce the input concentration and speed, can not stop infusion, to prevent reactive hypoglycemia . 5. the concentration of glucose used in neonatal asphyxia resuscitation is 5%.","the storage of fetal liver glycogen mainly occurs in the last 4 to 8 weeks of gestational age. the differentiation of fetal brown fat begins from 26 to 30 weeks of gestational age and continues until 2 to 3 weeks after birth. on the one hand, low birth weight infants, including premature infants and small for gestational age (sga) children, have less glycogen and fat storage, and on the other hand, the energy required for postnatal metabolism is relatively high, which is prone to hypoglycemia. there is data to confirm that the glycogen synthase activity of sga children is low, so glycogen synthesis is less, and the amount of sugar required for metabolism of some important organs is relatively large. the brain needs to increase the glucose requirement and utilization rate of sga children. the ratio of brain weight to liver weight increased from normal 3:1 to 7:1, and brain utilization of sugar was twice as high as that of liver. newborns with serious diseases such as asphyxia, rds, and scleredema are prone to hypoglycemia. these stress states are often accompanied by increased metabolic rate, hypoxia, hypothermia, and reduced intake. hypoxia can cause hypoglycemia. hypoxia has different effects on glucose metabolism in term infants and premature infants. hypoglycemia occurs in neonates with apgar scores of 1-3, because full-term children use glucose in stress. premature infants have poor ability to use glucose. domestic scholars have confirmed that the incidence of hypoglycemia in neonates with cold or hypothermia is high, which is related to the ability of hypothermia to meet the need for thermoregulation. the rate of glucose metabolism increases during neonatal infection, and the average glucose consumption rate is about 3 times higher than that of normal children. the neonatal gluconeogenesis enzyme activity is low, while the infection aggravates the deficiency of gluconeogenesis, and the amino acid is not easily converted into glucose. neonatal gluconeogenesis mainly relies on the release of glycerol from brown fat. when the infection is severe, the brown fat is depleted, and the source of gluconeogenesis is interrupted, thus lowering blood sugar. in addition, when the infection is reduced, the patient's intake is reduced, the digestion and absorption function is weakened, and hypoglycemia is also likely to occur. temporary hyperinsulinemia is common in infants with diabetes in their mothers.due to high blood sugar in pregnant women, fetal blood sugar also increases, and hypoglycemia occurs after the birth of glucose from the mother.due to the destruction of red blood cells in the hemolytic disease of the fetus, the glutathione in the red blood cells can inhibit the action of insulin in the plasma, and can also cause hyperinsulinemia in the islet hyperplasia of the islet b cells of the fetus.children with polycythemia can have hypoglycemia after transfusion of blood with citrate and glucose as maintenance fluid. because of the high glucose concentration in the maintenance fluid, insulin secretion is stimulated, and the insulin level is still high in the short time after transfusion.persistent hyperinsulinemia includes islet cell adenomas, islet cell proliferative disorders, and beckwith syndrome (characterized by large body, large tongue, umbilical hernia, and certain malformations with hyperinsulinemia). in neonates with galactosemia, the amount of galactose in the blood increases and the glucose decreases accordingly.in children with glycogen storage disease, the glycogen decomposition is reduced, and the amount of glucose in the blood is low.in neonates with leucine allergy, leucine in breast milk increases insulin secretion.other congenital dysfunctions such as the pituitary gland, thyroid gland or adrenal gland can also affect blood sugar levels.","['coma', 'hypoglycemia', 'hypoglycemic coma', 'intracranial hemorrhage',

thymoma,"the thymus is an important immune origin of the human body. it originates from the third (or fourth) sacral endoderm in the embryonic period. it is a derivative of the original foregut epithelial cells. it attaches to the anterior mediastinum with embryonic growth and development. it has unique clinicopathological features and is associated with it. a disease with paraneoplastic symptoms. thymoma is a tumor derived from the thymic epithelium, accounting for about 50% of the anterior mediastinal tumor. the clinical manifestations are different, often accompanied by many autoimmune abnormalities. recently, the understanding of autoimmune enteropathy is gradually affected. pay attention to it, but its incidence rate is not clearly reported.","there is no effective preventive measure for this disease. early diagnosis and early treatment is the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease. at the same time, attention should be paid to prevent the occurrence of various complications. once it occurs, it should be actively treated to prevent further development of the disease.","thymic tumors originating from thymic epithelial cells or lymphocytes are the most common. 95% of thymic tumors rank first to third in the entire mediastinal tumor. most thymoma is benign in histocytology, but some of them are biological. behaviorally invasive growth, malignant thymoma malignant thymoma also includes thymic carcinoma, which is a typical malignant feature of histological cytology. like any mediastinal tumor, the clinical symptoms of thymoma arise from compression of surrounding organs and symptoms characteristic of the tumor itself - the combined syndrome. small thymoma has no clinical complaints and is not easy to be found. when the tumor grows to a certain volume, the common symptoms are chest pain, chest tightness, cough, and chest discomfort. the nature of chest pain is non-characteristic, the degree is not equal, and the location is not specific. generally speaking, it is lighter and often treated symptomatically. no further examination is performed. symptoms were delayed for a long time, some patients underwent x-ray examination, or some patients found shadows of mediastinal mass when examining chest or chest. the neglected diagnosis of thymoma often grows to a considerable volume, with no signs of venous or superior vena cava syndrome. severe chest pain, rapid symptoms in a short period of time, severe irritating cough, dyspnea caused by pleural effusion, pericardial effusion caused by palpitation, shortness of mind, and concern about bone pain, suggesting the possibility of malignant thymoma or thymic cancer. pathogenesis most thymoma is inflated and has a complete capsule. even if the tumor is large, it is easy to completely remove. 30% to 60% of thymoma is invasive and can directly invade surrounding tissues and organs, such as mediastinal pleura. , pericardium, lung, large blood vessels and nerves, extending to the neck and invading the thyroid gland, spreading down the aortic sulcus to the underarm liver, around the kidney and peritoneal blood vessels, the lymphatic metastasis of thymoma is relatively small, may be affected lymph nodes are mediastinal lymph nodes, hilar lymph nodes, cervical lymph nodes, supraclavicular lymph nodes, axillary lymph nodes, hilar and mesenteric lymph nodes, etc., blood transfer is more rare, metastatic target organs and tissues are lung, liver, bone, kidney, brain, spleen, adrenal gland, breast and ovary. pathological features: all thymoma originated from thymic epithelial cells, and only 4% of thymoma consisted of a single thymic epithelial cell. most thymoma was composed of a mixture of thymic epithelial cells and lymphocytes. 1. visual inspection: the volume of thymoma varies from 1.5 to 25 cm, more than 5 to 8 cm, and the weight is 10 to 1750 g, usually 20 to 200 g. the color is dark brown or grayish red. round, elliptical or irregular, the surface is often nodular, benign, intact, no adhesion to the surrounding, invasive growth of malignant, incomplete capsule, rough surface, involving the pleura, pericardium, large blood vessels the tumor is soft in texture, and more than half of the capsules are attached with residual degenerative thymus adipose tissue. the tumor tumors are mostly substantial, and the cut surface is lobulated, with obvious gray-white fibrous tissue spacing, and the cut surface is grayish red or grayish white, showing coarse or fine particles. it is often accompanied by hemorrhage or cystic changes. the size of the capsule varies from 0.2cm microcapsules to large capsules with a diameter of about 10cm. even most of the tumors are cystic, and the capsule wall is thin. smooth, containing clear liquid or bloody fluid, can often see a variety of degenerative changes, such as hemorrhage, calcification and cystic changes, in addition to the entire thymus tissue has been replaced by thymoma tissue, most thymoma and normal thymus tissue bordering 2. microscopic structure: victor and thomas studies have shown that all thymoma are derived from thymic epithelial cells, and their epithelial components can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry techniques. lewis and other recommendations for thymoma are as follows: 1 epithelial thymoma, epithelial cells account for more than 66% of the total number of tumor cells; 2 lymphocytic thymoma, lymphocytes account for more than 66% of the total number of tumor cells; 3 are not consistent the above two types of tumors are classified as mixed thymoma; 4 tumors are composed of mutated epithelial cells classified as spindle-shaped thymoma, and thus some are called a subtype of epithelial cell type. classification: domestic tends to be classified according to the characteristics of cell morphology and relative quantity. there is no clear concept of quantity, which is the following four types. (1) epithelial cell type: accounting for 27% to 34% of thymoma. the epithelial cells are mainly composed of different epithelial cells. the morphological changes are complex, round, oval or fusiform, and the cytoplasm is light. translucent for eosinophilic staining or two-color staining, cell borders are unclear, nuclear chromatin is uniform, nucleoli is obvious, its shape is regular, nuclear membrane is clear, cells have clusters of habits, arranged in a sheet, nested , a variety of forms, such as strips, wire mesh, fissures or fake daisy-shaped clusters, the blood vessels are rich, the tumor cell mass is surrounded by fibrous tissue, and there are scattered and varying numbers of lymphocytes. under the electron microscope, the characteristics of tension fibrils and desmosome of epithelial cells can be seen. the cytological characteristics of epithelial thymoma without malignant tumors, only 2% of epithelial thymoma atypical changes, pleomorphic, nuclear and cytoplasmic ratio increased, nuclear chromatin is dense, nucleoli visible small splitting, this type of invasive growth is common and occasionally necrotic areas within the tumor. (2) lymphocyte type: 20% to 27%, the main component is lymphocytes. the size of lymphocytes is small, round, the nucleus is large and reticulate, the nucleolus is unclear, mature and there is no atypical manifestation, diffuse hyperplasia or nodular hyperplasia, see lymphatic germinal center, how much leaflet interval different, there are scattered or focal, nested epithelial cells, common hastelloy and microcalcification, blood vessels are rich, sometimes visible hyperplasia of capillary endothelial cells, lymphocytes in thymoma the response to polyclonal antisera markers is consistent with lymphocytes in normal thymus tissue and there are no signs of malignant transformation. (3) mixed type: 40% to 55%, the number of epithelial cells and lymphocytes are approximately equal, diffusely mixed or nodular, or the two cellular components are regionally distributed, and the boundary is obvious, often in a tumor. different sections showed that the cell morphological components were very inconsistent, and the connective tissue in the stroma was obviously proliferated. (4) spindle cell type: 2% to 4%, many scholars believe that it is a variant of epithelial cells, cells and nuclei are fusiform, closely arranged, sometimes spiral or fence-like, blood vessels are rich, often mixed with epithelial cells, there is a migration relationship between the two, under the electron microscope can be seen. the pathological tissue type of thymoma is not directly related to staging, and there are various options for staging of thymoma. however, most of the spindle cell types grow in the envelope, while the epithelial cells are easy to infiltrate and grow outside the capsule. therefore, most of the literature reports that epithelial cell type thymoma is more common in stage ii and iii. the proportion of thymoma in each stage, most reports in the literature: 2 / 3 thymoma is stage i, less than 1/3 of thymoma is stage ii ~ iii.","[' dull pain', 'diarrhea', 'breathing difficulty', 'jugular vein anger', 'pain pain', 'night sweat', 'lack of strength', 'low fever', 'repeated infection']",['nephrotic syndrome'],"['surgery', 'heart and thoracic surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hematoporphyria,"hematoporosis (hematoporphyria), formerly known as purple disease, is a rare disease, mostly caused by genetic defects caused by the lack of enzymes involved in the heme synthesis pathway leading to porphyrin metabolism disorders.the clinical manifestations are mainly light-sensitive skin lesions, abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms. porphyrin precursors may be the material basis for abdominal and neuropsychiatric symptoms.the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in the pathogenesis of abdominal pain and increased blood pressure.according to the site of porphyrin metabolism disorder, it is divided into erythropoietic hematoporphyria and hepatic porphyria.","1. avoid inducement should not take a variety of drugs that cause symptomatic porphyrinuria.avoid excessive fatigue, mental stimulation and hunger, alcohol, infection and other incentives to reduce the onset of the disease. 2. dietary sugars have the effect of inhibiting ala synthase, so high glucose intake is quite effective in preventing and treating the onset of most cases.in acute attacks, 10% to 25% glucose or fructose at a rate of 10 to 15 g/h, intravenous infusion for 24 hours with a high-glucose diet can quickly relieve symptoms.","acute intermittent hematoporphyria is more common and is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by a deficiency of pbg deaminase (urinary porphyrinogen synthase), which causes the conversion of intrahepatic pbg into uroporphyrinogen iii. the decrease in the heme synthesis disorder caused by this enhances the action of ala synthase, and as a result, the synthesis of ala and pbg is increased and the discharge from the urine is increased. metabolic disorder of porphyrin leads to abnormal porphyrin synthesis and increased production and excretion of porphyrin and its precursors including →-aminolevulinic acid (ala) and bilirubin (pbg), which is the only endogenous photoinduced light in human body. the sensitizer has a special absorption spectrum, which is most obvious at a wavelength of 405 nm. when the porphyrin and its derivatives absorb light waves, they are activated to emit red fluorescence, which destroys skin lysosomes and causes photoreceptive skin damage. the degree of light perception is urinary porphyrin. the strongest, the original porphyrin and coproporphyrin followed, while ala and pbg have no photo-sensing, normal people's sunburn wave is 280-320nm, and patients with increased porphyrin in the body can still occur after using glass filter to remove sunburn. light sensitive skin damage. porphyrins are mainly synthesized in red bone marrow and liver. according to the site of porphyrin metabolism disorder, hematoporphyria is divided into two types: erythropoietic hematoporphyria and hepatic porphyria. heme synthesis the lack of different enzymes leads to different types of hematoporphyria. as shown in figure 1, erythropoietic hematoporphyria, also known as myeloid hematoporphyria, is caused by a disorder of porphyrin metabolism in the bone marrow, depending on the porphyrin produced. also divided into: 1 protoporphyrin type; 2 urinary porphyrin type; 3 fecal porphyrin type, hepatic porphyria caused by intrahepatic porphyrin metabolism disorder, divided into 4 subtypes: acute intermittent porphyrin disease; delayed cutaneous porphyria; mixed porphyria; hereditary fecal porphyria.","['keratitis', 'powerless', 'tension', 'irritability', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation', 'low fever', 'disgusting', 'photosensitive skin damage', 'hypotension']",['erythema'],"['internal', 'genetic diseases']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(pleomorphicadenoma).mixed tumors are not absolutely benign and are low-grade malignant tumors, also known as critical tumors.","for the prophylactic anti-infection of general surgery, sulfa drugs (such as compound sulfamethoxazole) or drugs mainly acting on gram-positive bacteria (such as erythromycin, penicillin, etc.) are used. people with poor constitution or concurrent infections often use drugs. more commonly used: drugs that act on gram-positive bacteria (such as penicillin) plus drugs that act on gram-negative bacteria (such as gentamicin) plus drugs that act on anaerobic bacteria (such as metronidazole); surgery patients with severe infections or complications before and after can choose effective antibiotics according to clinical and drug susceptibility tests. the mixed tumor of the parotid gland must be treated surgically. it is not sensitive to radiation and generally cannot be treated with radiotherapy. because the tumor is a critical tumor, the tumor can survive for a long time or improper treatment, and it can cause malignant transformation. therefore, once the tumor of the parotid gland is found, surgical resection should be promptly performed. it is forbidden to use some externally applied drugs with unknown ingredients. the tumor generally grows slowly and can be asymptomatic for a long time. however, if growth is accelerated, the hardness increases, etc., it means malignant transformation, and surgery should be performed immediately, but the operation after malignant transformation the prognosis is far less than the prognosis of benign surgery.","mixed tumors often occur in the parotid gland, followed by the ankle, submandibular gland, sublingual gland, cheek, mouth, and lips.the tumor is derived from the ectoderm and mesoderm. it is round or lobulated, with intact or incomplete capsules. the cut surface is grayish white, partially translucent mucus, and sometimes cartilage. microscopic examination showed that some of the tumors were epithelial cells with different cell morphology, mostly cuboidal or polygonal, which could be basal cell-like, or squamous epithelium. cells were arranged in multiple cords or patches, or composed of different sizes. the cystic cavity, or most of the scattered glands, between the epithelial cell mass, has fibrous tissue, and often has transparency. in addition, there are mucous tissue and cartilage-like, bone-like tissue, of which mucus tissue is most prominent, and mucous cells can be star-shaped, fusiform or polygonal, sometimes visible epithelial cells transition to mucous cells, cartilage tissue in the tumor is similar to normal tissue, but most of the differentiation is incomplete, similar to mucus tissue (figure 1), there are often tumors in the capsule buds, so the tumor has a clear tendency to relapse.","['face nerve paralysis', 'pharyngeal foreign body sensation', 'slow growth', 'sustained pain', 'neck lymphadenopathy']",['salivary fistula'],"['oncology', 'tumor surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(b) the pathogenesis of the disease is currently considered to be related to viral infections, because often have a history of upper respiratory tract infection before the onset of the disease, or a history of colds or mumps, etc., patients can often have fever, sore throat, all over the body symptoms such as fatigue and muscle aches, and the number of white blood cells does not increase. mumps virus can be detected from the thyroid tissue of patients, and antibodies against various viruses such as coxsackie virus and influenza virus can be detected in the blood of patients. adenosis virus and mumps virus antibodies, etc., a small number of patients without a history of special infection can detect other viruses and antibodies, and the changes in the titer are related to the course of the disease. the disease is also an autoimmune disease, because there are reports that 35.1% ~ 42.0% of patients can detect anti-thyroid antigen antibodies and anti-microsomal antibodies, but the titer is not high, it is likely to be subacute thyroiditis damage caused, it is not certain that its cause, can only indicate the existence of temporary immune system dysfunction in subacute thyroiditis, still to be further studied. the thyroid gland can be diffuse or nodular, up to twice the normal size, but not too large. the cut surface can be seen as transparent colloid, scattered in the gray lesion area, and many follicular epithelial cells disappear in the early stage. local epithelial cells and follicular space have inflammatory cells infiltrated, thyroid epithelial cells may have degeneration and necrosis, early focal inflammatory reaction, decreased glial, typical pathological changes of subacute thyroiditis are surrounded by thyroid tissue cells the collagen blocks form giant cells, and most of the follicles form giant cells. at this time, the gelatin is significantly reduced. after the follicular epithelium is regenerated, the giant cells gradually decrease and disappear. as a result, the follicular structure is mutated, it is difficult to recognize, and the late inflammation is gradually reduced and lymphatic. cell infiltration, follicular regeneration and fibrosis during recovery, lesions can be similar to tuberculous nodules, so it can be called pseudotuberculosis thyroiditis, ie pseudotuberculous thyroiditis, due to its pathological changes, clinically the course of the disease can occur hyperthyroidism, or hypofunction and normal function, are temporary.","['chill war', 'tension', 'sore pain', 'goiter', 'lack of strength', 'low fever', 'hyperthyroidism', 'heart palpitations']",['edema'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
primary aldosteronism,"primary aldosteronism (primary aldosteronism) is caused by the lesion of the adrenal cortex, which secretes excessive aldosterone, resulting in retention of water and sodium, increased blood volume, and inhibition of the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. a syndrome characterized by hypertension and hypokalemia.most are caused by adrenal aldosterone adenomas, and

first guaranteed.an appropriate amount of sodium chloride is then used as a seasoning to make up the total amount of sodium required.","(1) the cause of the disease is still unclear. according to the pathological changes and biochemical characteristics of the cause, there are five types of primary aldosteronism:1. adrenal aldosterone adenoma (apa): occurs in the adrenal spheroidal band and secretes the benign tumor of aldosterone, the classic conn syndrome, is the main cause of primary aldosteronism, the most common type of clinical, accounting for 65% to 80%, the most common with a single adenoma, the left side is more than the right side; bilateral or multiple sexual adenomas account for only 10%; individual patients can have adenoma on one side and hyperplasia on the other side. the diameter of the tumor is between 1 and 2 cm, with an average of 1.8 cm. the weight is between 3 and 6 g. more than 10 g is rare. it is round or oval, the capsule is intact, and has obvious boundary with the surrounding tissue. the cut surface is golden yellow. the adenoma is mainly composed of large transparent cells. this kind of cells is 2 to 3 times larger than the normal bundled cells, and the light microscope the adrenal cortical spheroidal cells, reticular or dense cells, and ""hybrid cells"" of different sizes are displayed. the ""hybrid cells"" are characterized by globular bands and bundled cells. some adenoma cells can have globular bands at the same time. diffuse hyperplasia the mitochondrial ridge of tumor cells under electron microscope showed a small plate shape, showing the characteristics of spheroidal cells. the cause of aldosteronoma was unknown. the plasma aldosterone concentration was parallel to the circadian rhythm of plasma acth, but there was no obvious response to the change of plasma renin. patients with type biochemical abnormalities and clinical symptoms are more obvious and typical than other types of primary aldosteronism. 2. idiopathic hyper aldosteronism (iha): abbreviated as aldosteronism, i.e., idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, accounting for 10% to 30% of adult primary aldosteronism, and accounting for the first place in children with primary aldosteronism. the incidence rate has an increasing trend, and the pathological changes are cell proliferation of bilateral adrenal spheroidal bands, which may be diffuse or focal, hyperplastic cortex visible micronodules and large nodules, hyperplastic adrenal gland volume, thickness, increased weight, large nodular hyperplasia on the surface of the adrenal gland can be seen as golden nodular bulge, as small as sesame, as large as soybeans, no nodules in the nodules, which is the fundamental difference between pathological and adenoma, visible under the light microscope cells, similar to normal bundled cells, most of which are scattered or clustered. the etiology of aldosteronism is still unclear. the aldosteronism has histologically stimulated adrenal gland, and the aldosterone synthase gene there is no mutation, but the expression of this gene is increased and the enzyme activity is increased. some scholars believe that the spheroidal band of patients with aldosteronism is oversensitive to atii, and the use of acei drugs can reduce the secretion of aldosterone. scholars have proposed the hypothesis of the pathogenesis of aldosteronism: abnormal activity of some serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system, stimulation of pituitary aldosterone stimulating factor (asf), 汕-endophage (汕-endorphin, 汕 -end) and 汐-melanocyte stimulating hormone (汐-msh), causing the adrenal cortical spheroidal zone to proliferate and secrete a large amount of aldosterone. the study also found that the serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine can make this the levels of aldosterone in the blood of patients with various types of patients decreased significantly, suggesting that serotonin activity is enhanced, which may be related to the pathogenesis of this disease, but there is no evidence that any of the former pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc) products are in patients with aldosteronism, the concentration of spheroid cells can be stimulated in the blood circulation. the biochemical abnormalities and clinical symptoms of patients with aldosteronism are not as obvious as those of apa patients. the concentration of blood aldosterone is not parallel with the circadian rhythm of acth. 3. glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (gra): also known as dexamethasone suppressible hyperaldosteronism (dsh), since 1966 suther-land dja reported first since the case, there have been more than 50 cases reported in foreign literature in 1990. there are also cases and family reports in china. it is a special type of primary aldosteronism, accounting for about 1%, more than adolescent onset, but may be familial or sporadic. familial individuals are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. the adrenal gland is large and small nodular hyperplasia. the plasma aldosterone concentration is parallel to the circadian rhythm of acth. this disease is characterized by exogenous acth that can stimulate aldosterone secretion. low-dose dexamethasone can inhibit the excessive secretion of aldosterone and restore the patient's blood pressure, serum potassium and renin activity to normal. the molecular biological mechanism of the disease found that the gene encoding aldosterone synthase and the encoding 11汕-hydroxylase the gene is non-equivalically exchanged and a new chimeric gene is generated. the 5' end of the chimeric gene is the sequence regulated by acth for 11汕 hydroxylase. its 3' end is the coding sequence of aldosterone synthase. the chimeric gene transcriptional translation product has aldosterone synthase activity, but its 5' end contains acth-regulated sequences, which can lead to the regulation and synthesis of aldosterone by acth. it is mainly expressed in the fascicular zone. when exogenous corticosteroids are used, the secretion of pituitary acth is inhibited by feedback, the expression level of the chimeric gene is decreased, and the secretion of aldosterone is also lowered, so the patient is given exogenous dexamethasone. the condition can be controlled more satisfactorily. 4. primary adrenal hyperplasia (pah): about 1% of the original aldosteronism, kater et al found in 1982 four cases between apa and iha, its pathological morphology and iha similarly, it can be unilateral or bilateral adrenal spheroidal hyperplasia, but its biochemical changes are similar to apa. this disease has a good response to spironolactone treatment. unilateral or subtotal resection of the adrenal gland can correct the symptoms and biochemical abnormalities of aldosterone. 5. aldosterone-producing carcinoma (apc): it is a type of adrenal cortical carcinoma, accounting for about 1% to 2% of primary aldosteronism, and can be found in any age group, but more than 30 to 50 years old. there is also a type in the literature that classifies ectopic aldosterone producing adenoma and carcinoma into primary aldosteronism, which is extremely rare and can occur in the kidney, adrenal residual tissue or ovary. (b) pathogenesis regardless of the cause or type of primary aldosteronism, its pathophysiological changes are caused by a large number of super-physiological requirements of aldosterone, mainly high blood sodium, hypokalemia, renin-angiotensin the system is inhibited and the base is poisoned. aldosterone is the most important mineralocorticoid in human body. its main physiological function is to promote the reabsorption of sodium ions by the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney and excretion of potassium ions. the patients with primary aldosteronism can secrete a large amount of aldosterone to exert the above physiological effects. :1 increased sodium reabsorption, decreased sodium excretion, sodium metabolism was ""positive balance"", sodium retention in the body caused extracellular fluid to dilate, blood volume increased; 2 increased concentration of na in extracellular fluid, na transferred to the cell increased sodium concentration in the blood vessel wall cells can enhance the reaction of the wall to norepinephrine and other pressurized substances in the blood; 3 the sodium concentration in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall increases, causing the water to remain in the cells and the blood vessel wall to swell the lumen is narrow and the peripheral resistance is increased. due to the combined effects of the above factors, hypertension is formed. when the blood sodium concentration increases and the extracellular fluid expands to a certain extent, the atrial pressure receptor is stimulated, and the atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) is atrial natriuretic peptide (acp). atrial natriuretic peptide is a kind of sodium, diuretic, the blood pressure lowering circulating hormone, its secretion is affected by the sodium concentration and blood volume in the blood. the increase of blood sodium concentration or blood volume can stimulate the atrial pressure receptor, release atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic factor secretion from atrial myocytes. increased and then inhibited the reabsorption of sodium by the renal proximal convoluted tubules, increasing the concentration of sodium ions reaching the distal convoluted tubules, surpassing the ability of the distal convoluted tubules to reabsorb sodium under the action of aldosterone, and increasing the excretion of urinary sodium, thereby compensating for the large amount of sodium aldosterone. the retention effect makes the sodium metabolism reach a near-balance state, no longer continue to sputum sodium, thus avoiding or reducing the occurrence of malignant hypertension, edema, heart failure, etc. caused by further expansion of extracellular fluid, such a kidney under the action of a large amount of aldosterone the small tube breaks away from the effects of aldosterone, and no longer appears to have significant sodium sputum, which is called the ""escape"" phenomenon of mineralocorticoid. can also inhibit hormone-secreting cells of the juxtaglomerular renin secretion and adrenal aldosterone, and can antagonize the vasoconstrictor angiotensin ｊ (atｊ) a. the potassium excretion of aldosterone is closely related to the effect of sodium reabsorption. the effect of aldosterone on potassium excretion in the distal convoluted tubules is affected by the concentration of na in the distal convoluted tubule. the higher the content of na in the distal convoluted tubule, the higher the k in the urine. in contrast, the content of na in the renal distal convoluted tubule is reduced, the k secretion is reduced, and the k excretion in the urine is also reduced, so when the sodium intake decreases or the sodium reabsorption of the proximal convoluted tubule increases, the sodium that reaches the distal convoluted tubule decreases, the aldosterone the potassium excretion is obviously weakened, and the urinary potassium excretion is a passive process. when the na in the distal convoluted lumen is reabsorbed, the electrical ions in the renal tubule are negative, and the intracellular the cations k and h are excreted in the urine as the electrochemical gradient is secreted into the intraluminal fluid. in patients with primary aldosteron, the sodium reabsorption of the distal convoluted tubule is increased due to the large amount of aldosterone, so the excretion of potassium is also increased. a large amount of potassium loss leads to severe potassium deficiency in the body, and a series of dysfunctions of nerves, muscles, heart, kidneys and pancreas caused by potassium deficiency, and potassium excretion is not affected by ※offset§. since sodium ""release"" is caused by atrial natriuretic peptide, the sodium reabsorption of the proximal convoluted tubule is reduced, but not by the decrease of sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. therefore, sodium reabsorption and na-k exchange in the distal convoluted tubule are not change, potassium is still lost, so the high blood sodium of patients with primary aldosteron is often not obvious, but hypokalemia is very common, after the loss of a large amount of potassium ions in the cell, at this time the extracellular fluid na and h enter the cell, na and the efficiency of h ion excretion from the cells is reduced, so na and h in the cells increase, and the extracellular fluid h decreases, causing the ph of the intracellular fluid to decrease to be acidemia, the ph of extracellular fluid to rise, and the increase in co2cp to be alkalemia. in the clinical common cause of potassium deficiency in the body caused by other causes (such as anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea), the k content of renal tubular epithelial cells is reduced, so na-k exchange in the distal convoluted tubule is reduced, na-h exchange is increased, and urine is acidic. in patients with primary aldosteronism, although potassium is deficient in renal tubular epithelial cells, na-k exchange in the distal convoluted tubules is promoted due to a large amount of aldosterone potassium excretion, and na-h exchange is inhibited, and renal tubules are inhibited. cell secretion h is reduced, so urine is not acidic, but neutral, even alkaline or weakly alkaline, so intracellular acidosis, extracellular liquid alkalosis and alkaline urine become the characteristics of primary aldosteronism, alkalosis when the extracellular fluid free calcium is reduced, and the aldosterone promotes the discharge of urinary magnesium, the blood magnesium is lowered, and the high blood volume of the patients with primary aldosteronism increases the excitability of the cell pressure receptors of the adjacent small artery device and inhibits the glomerulus. the side cells secrete renin, which reduces the production of angiotensin, and thus presents a typical clinical manifestation of low prorennin.","['metabolic alkalosis', 'diarrhea', 'drinking', 'tinnitus', 'dysphagia', 'metabolic hypokalemia', 'dizziness', 'weakness',

c islet functional beta cell tumor,"islet beta cell tumor. it is a secretory adenoma or carcinoma formed by islet 汕 cells.more than 20 to 50 years old, more than 90% of the single hair is benign, and occasionally part of the type i multiple endocrine neoplasia.the function of pancreatic islet 汕-cell tumor is slow, and a small number of patients have been diagnosed for a long time. for example, long-term misdiagnosis can cause permanent brain damage.islet cell tumors are relatively rare, mostly benign and a few malignant.","there is no effective preventive measure for this disease. early detection and early diagnosis are the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease. it is very important to maintain a good attitude, to maintain a good mood, to have an optimistic, open-minded spirit, and to be confident in the fight against disease. first, choose nutrient-rich diet, easy to digest, less irritating, low-fat diet, can give high-protein, multi-carbohydrate foods.","it is divided into functional and non-functional categories. among them, insulinoma is the most common, accounting for 60-90%. the tumor-prone site is the pancreas and tail, which are usually small, mostly less than 2.0cm.followed by gastrinoma (gastrinoma), accounting for 20%, often multiple, can occur outside the pancreas, more common in the duodenum and stomach wall.other rare islet cell tumors are glucagonoma, vasoactive intestinal peptide (vipoma) and somatostatinoma.non-functional islet cell tumors are usually large, even over 10 cm.","['hypoglycemia', 'memory disorder']",['stomach ache'],"['oncology', 'oncology']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
insulinoma,"insulinoma (lusulinoma) is an islet b cell tumor, also known as endogenous hyperinsulinemia, which is a common cause of organic hypoglycemia, accounting for 70-75% of islet cell tumors.most are benign, malignant accounted for 10 to 16%, insulinoma can occur at any age, but more common in young and middle-aged, about 74.6% of patients occurred in 20 to 59 years old, more men than women, the ratio of men to women is 1.4 to 2.1.","there is no effective preventive measure for this disease. early detection and early diagnosis are the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease.hypoglycemia is the basic cause of various clinical manifestations. hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia coma is caused by an increase in blood insulin concentration, more than early morning, fasting, fatigue, and emotional stress, early every few days, weeks or it occurs once in a few months, and the seizure is frequent and exacerbated over time.therefore, we must actively prevent the occurrence of hypoglycemia.","the main defect of insulinoma is storage. insulin cells can synthesize insulin and can also respond to various stimuli, but partially or completely lose the ability to store insulin. under normal physiological conditions, the maintenance of normal blood glucose concentration mainly depends on insulin. and the regulation of glucagon secretion, blood sugar level is an important factor in controlling insulin release. when blood glucose concentration drops, it can directly promote the secretion of glucagon, inhibit the secretion of insulin, when the blood sugar drops to 1.96mmol / l (35mg% when insulin secretion is almost completely stopped, this normal physiological feedback phenomenon is lost in patients with insulinoma, so that insulin continuously escapes from islet cells and inhibits glycogen decomposition beyond blood glucose levels. the requirement to cause hypoglycemia syndrome. after hypoglycemia occurs, the body should maintain blood sugar levels, compensatory acceleration of adrenaline secretion, increase phosphorylase activity, and promote the conversion of glycogen to glucose, so the blood and urine adrenaline content of patients can be increased, in low blood sugar early and comatose clinical manifestations of accelerated pulse, increased blood pressure, sympathetic sweating and other sympathetic nerves.therefore, the main metabolic change of insulinoma is hypoglycemia, which forms a central nervous disorder and even coma and sympathy due to hypoglycemia. the clinical sign of the adrenal gland system is excited. insulinoma can occur in any part of the pancreas. the incidence of pancreatic head, body and tail is basically the same. it occurs in the tail of the pancreas. the pancreatic head and the uncinate part are not easy to find. the tumor volume is generally small, and the tumor diameter is small. generally between 0.5 and 5 cm, but more than 80% of tumors are less than 2 cm in diameter, which makes it difficult to locate the diagnosis. most of them are spherical. most of the tumors have clear boundaries but no obvious envelope. some tumors have envelopes or the pseudo-envelope is softer than normal tissue and rich in blood supply. the living tumor seen in the operation is reddish brown or blue-violet, and the postoperative tumor section is dark red or reddish. the insulinoma is in various islet cell tumors. the most common type, about 50% of the tumors are simple 汕-cell tumors, but some are mixed tumors containing 汐-, 汛-, pp and g cells. the 汕-cell proliferation is diffuse and nodular. species, sometimes associated with small adenomas, it is difficult to identify specific types of tumor cells, whether by light or electron microscopy. insulinoma is composed of tumor cells, connective tissue and amyloid deposits between tumor cells and capillaries. light mirrornow the volume of the local islets is increased or increased. the tumor cells under the microscope are quite similar to the normal 汕-cells. it can be seen that the tumor cells are arranged in a cord-like or agglomerate shape, which are islet b cells of different sizes, and the cytoplasm is light. dyeing, containing particles, polygonal, cuboidal or columnar, the nucleus is round or oval, nuclear fission is rare, there are abundant functional organelles in the tumor cells under electron microscope, mitochondria in the cytoplasm is abundant, and tumors in some tumors the cells also contain typical 汕-cell secretory granules, but since not all insulinoma cells contain secretory granules inside, and other types of islet cells can also have high-density secretory granules, it is still difficult to judge tumors under electron microscope. the specific type of cell.","['coma', 'hypoglycemia', 'trembling', 'diarrhea', 'twitching', 'tachycardia', 'heart palpitations', 'liver enlargement']",['coma'],"['oncology', 'tumor surgery']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
primary hyperparathyroidism,"hyperparathyroidism (hyperparathyroidism) is referred to as hyperparathyroidism.can be divided into primary, secondary, three-on three.primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (pth) caused by lesions (tumor or hyperplasia) of the parathyroid gland, which leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia through the action on bone and kidney.secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by hypothalemia caused by various other causes other than thyroid, secondary to parathyroid hyperplasia, excessive secretion of pth.on the basis of secondary hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid gland is a persistent agitation, and the hyperparathyroid hyperplasia is transformed into an adenoma that can secrete pth autonomously. hey.it is extremely rare in clinical practice.","the following conditions are the most serious signs of primary hyperparathyroidism, should promptly correct high blood calcium, and strive for early surgery, 1 long-term hypercalcemia lesions, such as kidney stones, renal failure, fibrous cystic osteitis, hunchback , height shortened, false clubbing (indicating that the end of the phalanx has severe osteitis); severe myopathy, metastatic calcification (including lung, kidney, blood vessels, joint calcification and banding keratopathy, caused by deposition of conjunctival calcium phosphate ""red eyes""), anemia (excessive pth can induce bone marrow fibrosis and decreased hematopoietic function).2 there are signs of severe hypercalcemia, such as blood calcium >3.5mmol / l (14mg / dl), as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms.","causes of primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone caused by parathyroid adenoma, hypertrophic hypertrophy or adenocarcinoma, and its etiology is unknown. the pathological changes are as follows: (1) parathyroid lesions can be divided into three types. parathyroid adenomas account for more than 80%. small adenomas are buried in normal glands, and the larger ones can be several centimeters in diameter. adenomas have intact envelopes, often with cystic changes, hemorrhage, necrosis or calcification. most of the tumor tissue belongs to the main cell, and it can also be composed of transparent cells. no residual fat cells can be found in the adenoma. 90% of lesions involve a gland, and multiple adenomas are rare. adenomas can also occur in the ectopic parathyroid glands of the chest mediastinum, the thyroid gland, or the esophagus. hyperparathyroid hypertrophy in recent years, the number of cases caused by the proliferation of primary cells has increased (about 15%). when hypertrophic hypertrophy, the four glands are often involved, the shape is irregular, there is no capsule, and there are no cysts, hemorrhage and necrosis in the gland. the cell tissue is mainly composed of large water-like transparent cells with fat cells. due to the tissue compression around the proliferative area, the formation of a pseudo-envelope is easily mistaken for adenoma.there are tumor cell infiltration, nuclear packing, and metastasis in the capsule, blood vessel and surrounding tissues of the parathyroid carcinoma . (b) the mainbonelesions are osteoclasts or osteoblasts, bone absorption, varying degrees of bone decalcification, connective tissue hyperplasia constitutes fibrous osteitis. in severe cases, it causes multiple cystic lesions and ""brown tumors"", which are prone to pathological fractures and deformities. calcification is rare in neonatal tissues. skeletal lesions based on bone resorption are systemic. the distribution of bone diseases is more obvious in the phalanx, skull, mandible, spine and pelvis. in addition, changes such as bone hardening may occur. (c) ectopic deposition of calcium salts the kidney is an important organ for excretion of calcium salts, such as urine concentration and acidity during excretion, often can occur multiple urinary stones. calcium salt deposition can occur in the renal tubules or interstitial tissues. in addition, calcium salt deposition can occur in the lung, pleura, gastrointestinal mucosa, skin, and myocardium. pathogenesis due to excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone, calcium mobilizes from bone to blood circulation, causing hypercalcemia, while renal tubular reabsorption of inorganic phosphorus decreases, urinary phosphorus excretion increases, and blood phosphorus decreases.due to the autonomy of the tumor and the high blood calcium, the parathyroid gland cannot be inhibited, so the blood calcium continues to increase. if the renal function is intact, the urinary calcium excretion will increase and the blood calcium will decrease slightly, but the continuous increase of parathyroid hormone , causing extensive bone resorption and decalcification, bone matrix decomposition, mucin, hydroxyproline and other metabolites increased from urinary excretion, formation of urinary stones or renal calciumosis (nephrocalcinosis), secondary infection and other factors kidney function often suffers serious damage.in the later stage of renal insufficiency, phosphate can not be fully discharged, blood phosphorus concentration will rise, but blood calcium can be reduced, and stimulate the increase of thyroid secretion (secondary hyperfunction of tissues outside the tumor).although the disease is mainly mobilized by osteoclasts, the osteoblast activity also has a compensatory increase, so serum alkaline phosphatase is increased every time.","['stationary doctor', 'sleepiness', 'weight loss', 'appetite loss', 'multiple drink', 'four limbs numbness', 'constipation', 'hyperparathyroidism', 'disgusting', 'multiple urine ']",['high calcemia'],"['internal medicine', 'endocrinology']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment']"

(ptt and pt) are normal (but not all) in most cases. because of the widespread use of aspirin, which affects platelet function, acquired platelet dysfunction is common, and many other drugs can cause platelet dysfunction. many clinical diseases (such as myeloproliferative diseases, uremia, macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, cirrhosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus) can also affect platelet function. aspirin can make bleeding time in normal subjects slightly. prolonged, but for patients with pre-existing platelet dysfunction or severe hemagglutination (eg, given a therapeutic dose of heparin or severe hemophilia), it can significantly prolong the bleeding time during surgical extracorporeal circulation when blood flows through pumping the oxygenator can cause platelet dysfunction and prolonged bleeding time. therefore, regardless of the patient's platelet count, as long as there is a large amount of bleeding and prolonged bleeding after cardiac surgery, platelet concentrate should be given. platelet dysfunction appears to be mainly due to platelet surface fibrinolysis is activated, leading to the loss of platelet membrane glycoprotein ib and vwf binding sites. it is reported that aprotinin (a protease inhibitor that neutralizes plasmin activity) prevents bleeding during surgical cardiopulmonary bypass. time prolongs and reduces blood transfusions. due to chronic renal failure, uremia patients may have an unexplained bleeding time. in effective dialysis, the bleeding time can be temporarily shortened after input of cryoprecipitate or desmopressin. red blood cells or erythropoietin can be used to make red blood cells. the increase in the number can also shorten the bleeding time.","['pale pale', 'herpes', 'snots', 'tired']",['leukemia'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

acute tissue damage is common in traumatic tissue trauma (such as craniocerebral trauma, crush syndrome), extensive burns, in addition to pulmonary infarction, myocardial infarction, electroshock and so on. 6, other diseases allergic diseases (such as exfoliative dermatitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis), hyperthermia, ionizing radiation disease, splenectomy, late pregnancy, etc. (b) the pathogenesis of peripheral blood leukocytes increased or the appearance of immature cells, is the abnormality of cell production or release, may be accompanied by the defects of elimination, destruction, the specific mechanism is inconsistent, the current main views are as follows: 1, cell regulation mechanism changes hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation are regulated by a variety of cell growth factors, which play an important role in leukemia-like reactions. when microorganisms or endotoxins enter the body and are phagocytosed by macrophages, the host defense system responds quickly, and macrophages and t cells are activated to produce various hematopoietic growth factors such as g-csf, gm-csf, and m-csf. and release cytokines, lymphokines (such as il-1, il-3, tnf, etc.), ll-1, il-3, tnf and bacterial products can stimulate the secretion of gm-csf and g-csf, cm -csf, g-csf, il-3, etc. can stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and precursor cells, and promote the release of neutrophils from the reservoir to the marginal pool and circulation pool, so that the peripheral blood white blood cell count is significantly increased. at the same time, some immature cells such as early granules and protoplasts may appear to exhibit leukemia-like changes. when the microorganisms are encapsulated or cleared, the factors that stimulate the expression of colony stimulating factor (csf) gene are eliminated, and the peripheral blood leukocyte count can be back to normal. the regulation of eosinophils is similar to that of neutrophils. many factors such as antigen-antibody reaction, foreign proteins, parasites, etc. can cause eosinophilia, and eosinophils can be stimulated by eosinophil releasing factor. the resulting easily diffusible factor is derived from the eosinophil colony-stimulating factor of sensitized t cells and the low molecular weight polypeptide which can stimulate the production of eosinophils, and promotes the proliferation and release of eosinophils. is a sensitized t cell subset, which synthesizes cytokines (such as il-5), stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and release into eukaryotic cells in a short period of time, with leukemia-like changes, eosinophils the release is selective and rarely occurs in naive eosinophils. in addition, some tumor cells can also produce colony-stimulating factors, stimulate hematopoietic cell proliferation, differentiation, release, toxins, hypoxia, immune reactions, chemical substances and other factors can damage bone marrow capillary endothelial cells to damage the medullary blood barrier, resulting in some of the naive cells enter the blood circulation, and leukemia-like reactions occur. after splenectomy, the bone marrow may lose some of the control effect. therefore, when some external factors stimulate the bone marrow, it is easier to release the young or young red blood cells into the peripheral blood. 2, extramedullary hematopoietic myelofibrosis, advanced cancer and chronic severe anemia can occur in the extrahepatic hematopoietic fossa of the liver, spleen, etc., in the peripheral blood can appear neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells. 3, redistribution of blood cells, infectious lymphocytosis, infectious mononucleosis, peripheral blood lymphocytes increased significantly, there may be young lymphocytes, may be associated with lymphocyte redistribution, pertussis patients with pertussis can produce a factor that inhibits the transfer of lymphocytes from blood to tissues, causing lymphocytes to stay in the blood for too long and increasing in number. at this time, the lymphocytes in the blood are mainly helper t cells, and in some cases, patients recovering from infection due to the reduction of neutrophils required in the tissue, neutrophils accumulate in the peripheral blood, and a leukemia-like reaction occurs.","['lymph node enlargement',

agranulocytosis,"the normal white blood cell count of peripheral blood is 4-10G10^9/l, and neutrophils account for 60-75%.neutropenia is the absolute count of peripheral blood neutrophils (total number of white blood cells G percentage of neutrophils) <10 years old children less than 1.5 G 10 ^ 9 / l, 10 ~ 14 years old children less than 1.8 G 10 ^9/l, adults below 2.0G10^9/l.when neutrophils are severely reduced (less than 0.5 G 10 ^ 9 / l), it is called granulocytosis.","1. for drugs that may cause this disease, the indications for medication should be strictly controlled and should not be abused. 2. for long-term exposure to radioactive materials, x-rays and certain chemical substances, attention should be paid to prevention work, and blood images should be checked regularly. 3. the room keeps the air circulation fresh, avoiding the cold and preventing colds.","normal adults produce a large number of neutrophils in the bone marrow every day, about 1011 or more. colony stimulating factors il-3 and gm-csf can promote g0 hematopoietic stem cells to enter the cell proliferation cycle, and g-csf specifically induces proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte progenitor cells in the bone marrow proliferation pool. the promyelocytes stopped proliferating and continued to differentiate into a rod-shaped nucleus and a neutral lobular nucleus. these cells can stay in the bone marrow reservoir for about 5 days before entering the surrounding blood. the cause of agranulocytosis is due to the fact that certain pathogenic factors directly damage the bone marrow, causing abnormal or quantitative hematopoietic dysfunction of cfu-gm. both anti-tumor drugs and immunosuppressive agents directly kill the proliferating cell population. the drug inhibits or interferes with granulocyte nucleic acid synthesis, affects cell metabolism, and blocks cell division. the direct toxic effects of the drug cause neutropenia to be associated with drug dose. other classes of drugs can also have direct cytotoxicity or reduce granulocyte production through immune mechanisms. chemical benzene and its derivatives, dinitrophenol, arsenic, antimony and the like have toxic effects on hematopoietic stem cells. x-rays, gamma rays and neutrons can directly damage hematopoietic stem cells and the bone marrow microenvironment, causing acute or chronic radiation damage and neutropenia. autoimmune neutropenia: autoantibodies, t lymphocytes, or natural killer cells act on different stages of granulocyte differentiation, causing bone marrow damage to impede granulocyte production. common in rheumatism and autoimmune diseases. some drugs are haptens that enter the sensitive body and bind to granulocyte membrane proteins or bind to plasma proteins to form a whole antigen to adsorb to the surface of granulocytes. these whole antigens stimulate the body to produce the corresponding anti-granulocyte antibody igg or igm. agglomeration and destruction of granulocytes are caused when the drug is repeatedly administered. this is called immunopharmaceutical granulocytosis. some patients have allergic reactions to certain drugs (sulfonamides, antipyretic analgesics, antibiotics, etc.), in addition to causing neutropenia, often accompanied by rash, urticaria, asthma, edema and other allergic manifestations. the cause of immunogenic neutropenia is independent of the dose used. bacterial infections such as mycobacteria (especially mycobacterium tuberculosis) and viral infections such as hepatitis virus. bone marrow metastasis, hematopoietic malignancies and myelofibrosis cause bone marrow hematopoietic failure. lack of folic acid and vitamin b12 affect dna synthesis.bone marrow is hematopoietic, but cell maturation is stagnant and destroyed in the bone marrow.some congenital agranulocytosis and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria also have maturity disorders, while granulocytes are reduced.","['coma', 'chilly', 'lymphedulitis', 'exfoliative dermatitis', 'breathing difficulties', 'cough', 'consciousness disorder', 'disgusting']",['coma'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(2) pathogenesis 1. originated from hematopoietic stem cells: cml is an acquired clonal disease originating from hematopoietic stem cells. the main evidences are: 1cml chronic phase may have red blood cells, neutrophils, acidophilus/basophils cells, monocytes and thrombocytosis. the erythroid cells, neutrophils, acidophilic/basophils, macrophages, and megakaryocytes of 2cml patients all have ph chromosomes. 3 in g-6-pd heterozygous female cml patients, red blood cells, neutrophils, acidophilic/basophils, monocytes and platelets express the same g-6-pd isoenzyme, fibroblasts. or two somatic cells can detect two g-6-pd isozymes. 4 each of the analyzed cells had identical structural abnormalities on chromosome 9 or 22. 5 molecular biology studies the chromosome 22 breakpoint variation exists only in different cml patients, and the breakpoints are consistent in different cells of the same patient. 6 x-linked gene locus polymorphism and inactivation pattern analysis also confirmed that cml is monoclonal hematopoiesis. 2. abnormal function of progenitor cells: relatively mature myeloid progenitor cells have obvious cell dynamic abnormalities, low fission index, few cells in dna synthesis phase, prolonged cell cycle, unbalanced nucleoplasm development, and mature granulocyte half-life ratio normal granulocyte elongation. the 3h suicide test confirmed that only 20% of cml colonies were in the dna synthesis stage, while normal humans were 40%. the cml primary and promyelocytic labeling index was lower than that of normal people, while the middle and late myelocyte marker index was normal. there is no significant difference compared to the photo. hematopoietic progenitor colony culture showed that the proliferation ability of cml myeloid progenitor cells and peripheral blood progenitor cells was different. the number of cfu-gm and bfu-e in bone marrow was usually higher than that of normal controls, but it could be normal or decreased, while peripheral blood could be elevated. up to 100 times the normal control. long-term culture of bone marrow cells in ph-positive cml patients revealed that ph-negative progenitor cells were detected in the culture medium after several weeks of culture, which has been confirmed to be mainly due to abnormal adhesion of cml hematopoietic progenitor cells. 3. molecular pathology: in 1960, nowell and hungerfor described the cml-associated ph chromosome, the first non-random chromosomal abnormality associated with a specific human tumor. in 1973, rowley used quinine and giemsa staining techniques to demonstrate for the first time that the ph chromosome (22q-abnormal) found in cml was caused by t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. the abl gene was cloned in the 9q34 break region in 1982. in 1983, it was confirmed that the gene fragment located in q34 translocated to chromosome 22 and a gene called bcr in the 22q11 fragmentation region formed a bcr-abl fusion gene. (1) abl gene: the proto-oncogene c-abl is located at q34 and is highly conserved during species development. it encodes a protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all mammalian tissues and various cell types. the c-abl is about 230 kb long. containing 11 exons, the trend is from the 5' end to the centromere. the first exon of this gene has two forms, exons 1a and 1b, and thus there are two different c-abl mrnas. the first one is called 1a-11 and is 6 kb long, including exons 1a-11. . the other, called 1b, starts from exon 1b, spans exon 1a and the first intron, and is adjacent to exon 2-11, and has a length of 6 kb. a variety of different abl proteins with a molecular weight of 145,000. dna sequence analysis found. c-abl is a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family. in addition to the kinase fragment, this gene also has sh2 and sh3 fragments that are important in the interaction and regulation of signaling proteins. c-abl is characterized by a a large c-terminal non-catalytic fragment containing an important sequence of dna and cytoskeleton binding and a region involved in the signal. normal p145abl shuttles between the nucleus and the cytosol, mainly localized to the nucleus, and has a low tyrosine kinase activity. the activity and intracellular localization of p145abl are regulated by integrins of the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. existing studies have shown that at least in fibroblasts, abl activation requires cell adhesion, so abl may transmit integrin signaling to the nucleus. thus acting as a bridge between adhesion and cell cycle signals, involved in cell growth and differentiation control. (2) bcr gene: the bcr gene is located at 22q11, 130 kb in length, with 21 exons, starting from the 5' end to the central granule. there are two different bcr mrna transcription patterns of 4, 5 kb and 6, 7 kb, encoding a protein of 160,000 protein p160 bcr, which has kinase activity. the c-terminus of p160 bcr is associated with the gtp activity of the ras-associated gtp-binding protein p21. (3) bcr-abl gene: the c-abl gene located at 9q34 is located on chromosome 22 and the bcr gene located at 22q11 forms a bcr-abl fusion gene. so far, three bcr breakpoint clusters have been found in cml patients, which are m-bcr, m-bcr, u-bcl and 6 bcr-abl fusion transcription modes, and b2a2, b3a2, b2a3 corresponding to m-bcr. the encoded protein is p210, corresponding to m-bcr, there is ela2, the encoded protein is p190, and corresponding to u-bcr, there is e19a2, and the encoded protein is p230. bcr-abl has been shown to cause cml in mouse models in vivo. the bcr-abl fusion protein is localized in the cytoplasm and has extremely high tyrosine kinase activity by altering some of the key regulatory proteins of the bcr-abl catalytic substrate. the status of activation activates a variety of signaling pathways, such as by activating the ras signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, increasing the number of progenitor cells, reducing the number of stem cells, and making stem cells part of the proliferation pool, thereby allowing immature granulocytes to expand. another mechanism of bcr-abl action is to alter normal integrin function. normal hematopoietic progenitor cells adhere to the extracellular matrix, and adhesion is mediated by progenitor cell surface receptors, especially integrins. bcr-abl interferes with 汕1. the function of integrins leads to defects in the cell adhesion function of cml cells, thereby releasing immature cells to the peripheral blood and migrating to the extramedullary space. recently, research on the pathogenesis of cml has progressed: 1 in vitro culture found that bcr-abl prolongs the factor-independent growth time of cml progenitor cells by inhibiting apoptosis. 2 down-regulation of bcr-abl expression by antisense oligonucleotide may inhibit the growth of leukemia cells in mice by increasing the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis, especially reducing the formation of early progenitor colonies in cml patients and reducing cml-like cell lines. cell proliferation. 3 bcr-abl, transformed, factor-independent, tumorigenic mouse hematopoietic cells increase sensitivity to apoptosis by up-regulating bcl-2. when bcl-2 expression is suppressed, bcr-abl positive cells become factor-dependent and non-tumorigenic. the above experimental results indicate that bcr-abl inhibits apoptosis and leads to the continuous expansion of myeloid cells, which is another pathogenesis of cml. (4) mechanism of catastrophic changes: cytogenetic studies have found that 80% of patients with ap or bp cml have secondary chromosomal abnormalities. the most common abnormalities are +8, +ph, i(17), +19, +21 and -y.about 80% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (acute granulosis) have non-random sex chromosomal abnormalities, and their karyotype often appears as hyperdiploid, the most common abnormality is +8, and +8 often with other chromosomes abnormalities such as i(17), +ph, and +19 occur simultaneously, followed by +ph, i(17), and -y.about 30% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (acute lymphocytosis) have secondary clonal chromosomal abnormalities, often chromosome loss, which is characterized by subdiploid or structural abnormalities. common abnormalities are +ph and -y, + 8 rare, i (17) has not been reported, -7, 14q + and acute lymphoblastic specific.although studies have found that cml has a mutation in n-ras gene and an increase in c-myc gene expression in blast crisis, its incidence is extremely low.the rb gene is rarely altered in patients with blast crisis.sill et al. found that the homozygous deletion of the p161nk4a gene is associated with cml acute leaching.the most important molecular mechanism of cml is the p53 gene. 20% to 30% of patients with acute granulosis have abnormalities in p53 gene structure and expression. the characteristics of cmlp53 gene change are: 1 the main changes are gene rearrangement and mutation.2 mainly seen in acute granulation, acute leaching is extremely rare.3p53 mutations are common in patients with 17p-abnormalities.4p53 mutations can cause granulocyte changes in cml.recently, there have been reports on the relationship between the degree of methylation of the calmodulin gene, the change of telomere length and telomerase activity and the rapid change of cml, but its significance needs to be further clarified.","['maocary rash', 'lymph node enlargement', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'fever', 'coffee spot', 'low', 'liver enlargement']",['eye drops bleeding'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

anemia,"in a certain volume of circulating blood, red blood cell count, hemoglobin volume and hematocrit are lower than the normal standard called anemia.among them, hemoglobin is the most important, adult males are less than 120g / l (12.0g / dl), adult females are less than 110g / l (11.0 / dl), generally can be considered anemia.anemia is one of the most common manifestations in the clinic. however, it is not an independent disease. it may be an important clinical manifestation of a basic or sometimes complex disease. once anemia is found, the cause must be identified.","usually eat more iron-rich foods, such as lean meat, pork liver, egg yolk and kelp, hairy vegetables, seaweed, fungus, fragrant beans and so on. pay attention to the reasonable combination of diet, such as eating some fruits after a meal, the fruit is rich in vitamin c and fruit acid, which can promote the absorption of iron. drinking strong tea after a meal is caused by the combination of iron and tannic acid in the tea to form a precipitate, which affects the absorption of iron. in addition, cooking food in a wok is good for preventing anemia. folic acid and vitamin b12 are also essential for hematopoiesis. fresh green vegetables, fruits, melons, beans and meat are rich in folic acid, meat and liver, kidney, heart and other internal organs, rich in vitamin b12, but after high temperature cooking, can make more than 50% the folic acid and 10-30% of the vitamin b12 were destroyed. therefore, in life, we must pay attention to diet diversification, but also pay attention to cooking techniques, try to avoid overcooking food.","(1) aplastic anemia (aa): aa is a bone marrow hematopoietic failure associated with primary and secondary hematopoietic stem cell damage. the pathogenesis of partial pancytopenia is related to the production of anti-myeloid autoantibodies by b cells, which in turn destroy or inhibit bone marrow hematopoietic cells. (2) pure red cell anemia (prca): prca refers to the damage of bone marrow erythroid hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which in turn causes anemia. according to the cause, the disease can be divided into two categories: congenital and acquired. congenital prca, the diamond-blackfan syndrome, is caused by heredity; acquired prca includes both primary and secondary. some scholars have found that some patients with primary prca have their own epo or young red blood cell antibodies in their serum. secondary prca mainly has drug-related, infection-related types (bacteria and viruses, such as parvovirus b19, hepatitis virus, etc.), autoimmune disease-related types, lymphoproliferative disease-related types (such as thymoma, lymphoma, plasma). cytopathic and lymphocytic leukemia, etc.) and acute aplastic crisis. (3) congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (cda): cda is a type of hereditary erythroid stem progenitor cells caused by abnormal clonal abnormalities, characterized by erythroid ineffective hematopoiesis and morphological abnormalities anemia. according to hereditary methods, the disease can be divided into autosomal concealed hereditary and dominant hereditary. (4) hematopoietic malignant clonal diseases: these diseases have abnormalities in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, including myelodysplastic syndromes and various hematopoietic neoplastic diseases such as leukemia. the former is due to pathological hematopoiesis, hyperproliferation, high apoptosis, and in situ hemolysis; the latter has tumoric hyperplasia, low apoptosis and poor differentiation, and hematopoietic regulation is also affected, thereby reducing normal mature red blood cells and causing anemia. the hematopoietic microenvironment includes bone marrow stroma, stromal cells and cytokines. (1) anemia caused by damage of bone marrow stroma and stromal cells: bone marrow necrosis, myelofibrosis, myelosclerosis, marble disease, bone marrow metastasis of various extramedullary neoplastic diseases, and various infections or non-infectious osteomyelitis the hematopoietic microenvironment may be abnormal due to damage to the bone marrow stroma and stromal cells, which may affect blood cell formation. (2) anemia caused by abnormal levels of hematopoietic regulatory factors: stem cell factor (scf), interleukin (il), granule-mono-column colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g- csf), erythropoietin (epo), thrombopoietin (tpo), platelet growth factor (tgf), tumor necrosis factor (tnf) and interferon (ifn) all have positive and negative regulation of hematopoiesis. insufficient epo occurs in renal insufficiency, liver disease, and pituitary or hypothyroidism; neoplastic diseases or certain viral infections induce more hematopoietic negative regulators such as tnf, ifn, and inflammatory factors, which can cause chronic disease. anemia. hematopoietic raw materials are substances necessary for the proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism of hematopoietic cells, such as proteins, lipids, vitamins (folic acid, vitamin b12, etc.), and trace elements (iron, copper, zinc, etc.). any deficiency or utilization of hematopoietic materials may result in reduced erythropoiesis. (1) anemia caused by deficiency of folic acid or vitamin b12 or utilization disorder: megaloblastic anemia caused by absolute or relative deficiency or utilization of folic acid or vitamin b12 due to various physiological or pathological factors. (2) iron deficiency and iron utilization of anemia: this is the most common anemia in the clinic. iron deficiency and iron utilization disorders affect heme synthesis, and this type of anemia is called hemoglobin synthesis abnormal anemia. the erythrocyte morphology of this type of anemia is small, and the central light-stained area is enlarged, belonging to small cell hypochromic anemia. anemia has different classifications based on different clinical features. such as: according to the progress rate of anemia, acute anemia, chronic anemia; according to the red blood cell morphology of large cell anemia, normal cell anemia and small cell hypochromic anemia; according to hemoglobin concentration of mild, moderate, severe and extremely severe anemia; bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia is divided into proliferative anemia (such as hemolytic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia, etc.) and hyperplastic anemia (such as aplastic anemia). clinically, the pathogenesis and etiology of anemia are often classified: (1) erythropoiesis-reducing anemia, hematopoietic cells, bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment, and abnormalities in hematopoietic materials affect erythropoiesis, which can form erythropoiesis-reducing anemia. (2) hemolytic anemia (ha), that is, red blood cells destroy excessive anemia (3) hemorrhagic anemia is divided into acute and chronic according to the rate of blood loss, and chronic hemorrhagic anemia is often associated with iron deficiency anemia.can be divided into coagulopathy (such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemophilia and severe liver disease) and non-clotting diseases (such as trauma, tumors, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, peptic ulcer, sputum and two types of gynecological diseases, etc.).","['be out of breath', 'tiredness', 'sleepiness', 'sustained dizziness', 'tinnitus', 'dizziness', 'disgusting', 'consciousness blurry', 'amnesic amenorrhea', 'nose color pale']",['malnutrition'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'chinese medicine syndrome differentiation']"
tetanus,"tetanus is an acute infectious disease characterized by invasive human body wounds by clostridium tetani, which grows and breeds under anaerobic conditions and produces neurotropic exotoxin which causes muscle tonic dysfunction.severe patients may die from a sore throat or a secondary severe lung infection. neonatal tetanus is caused by umbilical cord infection and has a high mortality rate.although the world health organization is actively pursuing a global immunization program, it is estimated that there are nearly a million cases of tetanus in the world each year, and hundreds of thousands of newborns die from tetanus.","daily prevention of tetanus 1. correct treatment of wounds. for small wounds, rinse the mud and ash outside the wound with water or soapy water. if conditions permit, apply iodine or yunnan baiyao disinfectant to the wound, then cover the wound with a clean cloth and gently wrap it. for some large wounds, first wrap the wound with clean gauze and then quickly go to the hospital for treatment. 2, pay attention to maternal health. 3, injection vaccination. 4, oral chinese medicine. tetanus health education tetanus prevention includes automatic immunization, passive immunization and debridement after injury and perinatal protection. 1. active immunization: china has already mixed the pertussis vaccine, diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid into a triple vaccine, which is included in the children's plan immunization. the inoculation target is 3 to 5 months old children, and the first year is subcutaneous injection of 0.25 ml, 0.5 ml. a total of 3 times with 0.5ml, 4 weeks apart, 0.5ml subcutaneously in the second year, and once again in 1 year and a half to 2 years old, and then 1ml once every 2 years, until before enrollment maintaining antibody levels, military personnel and vulnerable workers who have not been actively immunized with tetanus can use aluminum phosphate adsorption to purify tetanus toxoid for population immunization, which is economical and effective. the method is the first year of intramuscular. inject twice a time, 0.5ml each time, 4 to 8 weeks apart, 0.5ml intramuscularly in the second year, and then boost the injection once every 5 to 10 years to maintain the effective antibody level. in order to achieve enhanced antibody levels, tetanus toxoid is highly immune, with a high success rate after vaccination, and rarely after vaccination. in areas with high incidence of tetanus, pregnant women are encouraged to undergo tetanus immunization in the second trimester of pregnancy by intramuscular injection of 0.5 ml of tetanus toxoid for 3 times at intervals of 1 month. the last injection should be before delivery. in the month, this not only keeps the mothers with higher antibody levels during childbirth, but also has enough antibodies to pass on to the baby to achieve effective protection and prevention. the world health organization has widely promoted the global tetanus immunization program for children, hopefully in 2000. in the year, the world has basically eliminated tetanus. unfortunately, this goal is still far from being achieved. the planned immunization monitoring reports from the united states, britain and other countries show that tetanus protects antibodies and gradually decreases with age, only about 60% in adults. people have protective antibodies, so how to protect the elderly and further popularize the tetanus immunization program in developing countries remains a problem. 2, passive immunization: mainly used for the injured without auto-immunization of tetanus, using tetanus antitoxin tat, 1000 ~ 2000u, 1 injection, need to do a skin test before injection, if the skin test positive should be taken off sensitive injection method can be administered in divided doses. after the injection, the protection period can be maintained for about 10 days. it can also be administered intramuscularly with human tetanus immunoglobulin htig500F1000u, which can maintain the protection period of 3-4 weeks. to enhance the protective effect, it is best to start at the same time. after establishing active immunization and passive immunization, some people may still develop the disease, but usually have a long incubation period and a milder condition. 3, wound treatment: timely and thorough debridement and treatment of wounds, can effectively prevent the infection and reproduction of tetanus bacteria, including strict disinfection in maternal labor, have a positive preventive effect, in addition, such as deep wounds or pollution in severe cases, appropriate antibiotics should be used early to prevent and control infections. it is generally recommended to use the best within 6 hours of injury. the course of treatment is 3 to 5 days. the main purpose is to control the infection of pyogenic bacteria, so as to avoid the anaerobic microenvironment. control and prevent the purpose of growth and reproduction of clostridium tetani.","tetanus is widely found in soil and human and animal feces. both bacilli and their toxins cannot invade normal skin and mucous membranes. therefore, tetanus occurs after injury. all open injuries such as inflammatory lesions, open fractures, burns, and even small wounds such as thorns or rust spikes may cause tetanus, and tetanus is also seen in unsterilized umbilical cord stumps and unsanitary abortions in newborns; and occasionally after gastrointestinal surgery after removing the foreign body left in the body for many years, there is a tetanus in the wound, which is not necessarily the case; the occurrence of tetanus is not only related to the strong virulence of the bacteria, the quantity, or the lack of immunity, but also the hypoxia of the local wound is a disease-promoting factor, therefore, when the wound is narrow and deep, ischemic, necrotic tissue, poor drainage, and mixed, tetanus is easy to occur, the calcium chloride contained in the soil can have other infections requiring oxidative pus causes tissue necrosis when the wound is partially hypoxic, which is beneficial to the breeding of anaerobic bacteria. therefore, the stab of the rust nail or the forest thorn with soil may cause tetanus. clostridium tetani is a genus of anaerobic spores, obligate anaerobic, 2 ~ 5米m long, 0.3 ~ 0.5米m wide, has flagella around, can be active, gram stain positive, but in the breeding process when examined by wound smears, it can be negative for gram staining. clostridium typhimurium breeds under anaerobic conditions, forms propagules and produces toxins, but is easily killed by disinfectant and boil. when environmental conditions are unfavorable, the spores are formed at the end of the bacteria, which are shaped like drums. the tetanus spores have strong resistance to the external environment. they can survive in the soil for several years and must be autoclaved to kill them. tetanus exotoxin can be used. it is decomposed into 汐,汕,污 components by trypsin treatment, and their different clinical effects are called tetanospasmin, tetanolysin, and fibrinolysin. in addition to hemolysin can cause hemolysis and may lead to local tissue necrosis, the main cause of clinical symptoms is scorpion toxin, which is encoded by a plasmid with a molecular weight of 160G103 (two peptide chains: heavy chain 105G1)03; light chain 55 G 103), heat-resistant, destroyed at 65 ～ c for 30 min, its light chain is the toxic part, zinc endopeptidase; heavy chain (h chain) has binding and transport functions, hc and nc, the former can specifically bind to nerve cell surface receptors, the latter is conducive to the internalization of cells, allowing toxins to enter nerve cells. clostridium tetani has no invasiveness, does not invade the blood circulation, and only grows in local wounds. its pathogenic effect is mainly caused by the produced exotoxin. exotoxin mainly invades the spinal cord and brainstem motor neurons. once combined with nerve cells, it can not be neutralized by tetanus antitoxin. after invasive local wounds, clostridium typhimurium spores generally do not grow and multiply, such as suppurative infection with aerobic bacteria, local blood circulation caused by severe tissue trauma, or necrotic tissue. and the retention of foreign matter to form a local anaerobic microenvironment is very beneficial to the propagation of clostridium typhimurium. the bacteria proliferate in a large amount in the form of propagules and produce a large amount of scorpion toxin. the toxin first binds to the ganglioside of the nerve endings. the reverse nerve sheath passes through the spinal nerve root to transmit the anterior horn neurons of the spinal cord, and the brain stem cells are ascended. the toxin can also be absorbed by the lymph, and reaches the central nervous system through the blood. under normal circumstances, when the flexor motor neurons are stimulated and excited, impulsive also introduces inhibitory interneurons to release inhibitory transmitters (glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid).the corresponding extensor motor neurons relax the extensor muscle and coordinate with the flexor contraction. at the same time, the excitatory state of the flexor motor neurons is also inhibited by the negative feedback of the inhibitory neurons, so that they are not overexcited, tetanus scorpion toxin can selectively block inhibitory neurons, prevent the release of neurotransmitter inhibitors, and balance the contraction and relaxation of the flexor and flexor muscles while strongly contracting. in addition, tetanus toxin can inhibit nerves at the neuromuscular junction. the transmission of the neurites causes the acetylcholine to accumulate in the junction of the neurites, and frequently sends impulses to the periphery, resulting in sustained increase in muscle tone and muscle spasm, resulting in clinical closure of the jaws and angulation.","['coma', 'muscle soreness',

hypersplenism,"hypersplenism, referred to as splenomegaly, is a syndrome. many diseases can cause hypersplenism. among them, cirrhosis caused by various causes is the most common, such as cirrhosis after hepatitis, schistosomiasis. liver cirrhosis, portal cirrhosis, etc.; followed by chronic infections, such as malaria; and the hereditary spherocytosis in the blood system, autoimmune anemia, primary thrombocytopenic purpura and other diseases causes hypersplenism.the clinical manifestations are splenomegaly, one or more blood cells are reduced, and the bone marrow hematopoietic cells are correspondingly hyperplasia, the blood image is restored after splenectomy, and the symptoms are relieved.","actively prevent cirrhosis caused by various causes (especially schistosomiasis cirrhosis), chronic infections such as malaria, tuberculosis, malignant tumors such as lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelofibrosis and chronic hemolytic anemia and rare nets endothelial cell disease.","primary person refers to a series of manifestations that the underlying disease has not been determined, but clinically has hypersplenism. there are so-called primary spleen hyperplasia, non-tropical idiopathic splenomegaly, primary splenic granulocyte reduction, primary spleen whole blood cell reduction, splenic anemia or splenic thrombocytopenia. because the cause is unknown, it is difficult to determine whether the disease is a different cause of the same cause or an independent disease that is not related to each other. secondary is defined as a disease other than the spleen that affects the spleen, leading to hypersplenism, and most of the primary diseases have been diagnosed. more clinically seen secondary hypersplenism, including those with more obvious causes: (1) acute infection with splenomegaly: such as viral hepatitis or infectious mononucleosis. (2) chronic infections: such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, malaria, etc. (3) congestive splenomegaly: portal hypertension: intrahepatic obstructive (such as portal cirrhosis, necrotizing cirrhosis, biliary cirrhosis, hemosiderosis, sarcoidosis, etc.) and extrahepatic obstructive (external compression or thrombosis of the portal vein or splenic vein). (4) inflammatory granuloma such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, felty syndrome and sarcoidosis. (5) malignant tumors such as lymphoma, leukemia and cancer metastasis. (6) chronic hemolytic diseases such as hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and marine anemia. (7) lipid-like deposits such as gaucher disease and niemann-pick disease. (8) myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera, chronic myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis. (9) others: such as splenic aneurysms and cavernous hemangioma. regardless of primary or secondary splenomegaly, because the bone marrow compensatory hyperplasia is good, the peripheral blood picture does not show blood cell reduction, but once the infection or drugs and other factors inhibit the hematopoietic function, it can lead to single or whole blood cell cytoreduction. pathogenesis although the pathogenesis of hypersplenism still needs further investigation, according to the physiological functions of the spleen, there are several theories: 1. excessive retention the blood vessels in the spleen are rich in structure and special in structure. the blood cells stay in the sinusoids and spleen for a long time. the sinus cells and macrophages in the red pulp are well recognized by the filtered blood cells. retention performance. under normal circumstances, most of the blood cells that are blocked are senescent, congenital morphological abnormalities, abnormal hemoglobin structure, cells damaged by oxidized substances or encapsulated by antibodies, these blood cells usually remain in the spleen and suffer damage. there is no red blood cell or white blood cell storage in the normal spleen, but about 1/3 of the platelets and some lymphocytes are blocked in the spleen. when the spleen has a pathologically significant enlargement, not only more platelets (50% to 90%) and lymphocytes are retained in the spleen, but also more than 30% of red blood cells are retained in the spleen, resulting in platelets in the surrounding blood. and red blood cells are reduced. 2, excessive screening and phagocytosis of the spleen spleen mononuclear-macrophage system is overactive, while abnormal erythrocytes in the spleen cord (such as spherical cells and red blood cells damaged by antibodies, oxidants or other chemical poisons, physical factors, etc.) increased and cleared for macrophages, resulting in a significant reduction in red blood cells in the surrounding blood. some of the erythrocyte membranes have hydantoplasts, or there are gluten-like bodies in the syrup, and even the trophozoites of the malaria parasite; when the spleen enters the sinus, the common red blood cells are due to the hydantosome or the genus being trapped in the sinus basement membrane hole and dilemma, and finally excavated for the sinus wall macrophage, and the erythrocyte membrane was damaged. after repeated damage, the red blood cells become spherical cells and eventually cannot be swallowed through the pores of the basement membrane. 3, body fluid factors some scholars have suggested that the spleen can produce certain secretin to inhibit the formation and maturation of bone marrow blood cells, and also inhibit the release of mature blood cells in the bone marrow. once the inhibitory factor is removed, the abnormal performance of bone marrow cells quickly returns to normal. it has been proved that: 1 spleen extract can be injected into animals, which can reduce blood cells; 2 patients with spleen after the increased tolerance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, may be the result of removal of body fluid factors. 4, immune factors that hypersplenism is a type of autoimmune disease. the spleen can produce antibodies, destroying its own blood cells, and reducing the surrounding blood cells, and the bone marrow has compensatory hyperplasia. for example, immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the spleen is considered to be the main site for the production of antibodies, and is also the place to destroy blood cells; when the spleen is removed, the blood and bone marrow tend to improve. 5. dilution when the spleen is swollen, the total plasma volume is also significantly increased, which can dilute the blood and cause blood cells to decrease. the anemia is the result of the double action of pseudo-anemia caused by the retention and dilution of the spleen on blood cells. a large spleen can correct the dilute anemia and restore normal plasma volume.","['splenomegaly', 'bleeding tendency', 'venous thrombosis', 'portal hypertension', 'thrombocytopenia', 'dizziness', 'nuclear vertical eye muscles', 'heart palpitations']",['anemia'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,"hemolytic anemia caused by the deficiency of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) is a heterogeneous group of diseases, which is the most common type of hemolysis caused by erythrocyte enzyme deficiency.this disease is x-linked incompletely dominant inheritance, and g-6-pd activity measurement is the main means of diagnosis of this disease.there is currently no cure for this disease.","in areas with high g-6-pd deficiency, a general survey of g-6-pd deficiency should be performed. those who are known to be deficient in g-6-pd should avoid eating broad beans and their products, avoid taking oxidative drugs, and strengthen them. prevention of various infections. the vast majority of this disease has incentives to induce acute hemolysis, so prevention is extremely important. 1. group prevention in areas with high incidence of g6pd deficiency, large-area census or pre-marital antenatal, prenatal, umbilical cord blood screening is a more effective and sensible method to detect g6pd deficiency. 2. individual prevention (1) removal of incentives on the basis of screening, a ※g6pd-deficient carrying card§ containing drugs or foods that are banned or used with caution is provided for medical and personal reference. (2) neonatal jaundice: pregnant women with either couple or one of the g6pd deficiency, who take benzobarbital 0.03 to 0.06g per night for 2 to 4 weeks before delivery, can reduce neonatal hyperbilirubinemia or reduce the incidence rate; take cord blood for routine screening during childbirth to find g6pd deficiency newborn; prenatal and infant refusal to use oxidative drugs or use camphor pills to store clothes, mothers avoid eating broad beans and their products, actively prevent neonatal infection. 3. there is no special treatmentforerythrocyte g6pd deficiency, no treatment for hemolysis, removal of inducement when hemolysis occurs, suspending suspicious drugs, stopping eating broad beans, treating infection, etc. the acute hemolysis period of mild patients can be treated with general supportive therapy and rehydration. hemolysis and anemia are more serious, pay attention to water and electrolyte balance, correct acidosis, alkalinize urine, etc. to prevent renal failure; for severe anemia, hbP60g/l, or those with symptoms of heart and brain damage should be timely concentrated red blood cells, and monitoring to the disappearance of hb urine; try to use vitamin e, reduced glutathione and other antioxidant effects, prolong the life of red blood cells; neonatal jaundice is treated according to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia; for cnsha, rely on blood transfusion to maintain life splenectomy may be helpful, and conditions may be used for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct).","the normal ""enzyme"" is called g-6-pd b. the g-6-pd deficiency is caused by the abnormality of the g-6-pd structural gene encoding the g-6-pd amino acid sequence, and the detailed biochemistry of the partially purified residual enzyme. studies suggest that there is heterogeneity between them. these abnormal enzymes are g-6-pd biochemical variants. in 1966, the world health organization (who) held an international conference in geneva on the g-6-pd variant. the naming, typing standards and methods are uniformly defined. the g-6-pd is mainly based on electrophoresis rate and enzyme kinetic parameters, such as enzyme activity, electrophoresis rate, glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) and coenzyme ii (nadp). the michaelis constant (km), the substrate congener (deoxy g6p, galactose, deamination, nadp, coenzyme i) utilization, thermal stability, optimum ph, but at least the following five items are required: 1 enzyme activity 2 electrophoresis speed; 3g-6-pd michaelis constant; 4 relative deprivation rate of deoxygenated g6p; 5 thermal stability, currently, there are more than 400 g-6-pd variants reported in the world, among which about 300 species are identified according to the standard methods recommended by the who, and about 100 variants are identified by other methods, based on these variations. the enzymatic activity and clinical significance are divided into five categories: the first type of variant activity is very low (less than normal 10%) with lifetime hemolytic anemia; the second type of variant, although in vitro activity is very low, but not accompanied chronic hemolysis, hemolysis occurs only under certain special circumstances, this type is a common type such as g-6-pd mediterranean type; the third type of variant has a normal enzyme activity of 10% to 60 %, hemolysis occurs only when certain drugs or infections are taken; the fourth type of variant is due to mutations that do not alter the functional activity of the enzyme; the activity of the enzymes of the fifth type of variant is increased, the fourth and category 5 has no clinical significance. among the chinese, 12 species have been found in hong kong, taiwan and overseas chinese. du chuanshu and other found 35 species in guangdong, hainan, guizhou, sichuan, guiyang, yunnan and other provinces, 12 of which are in the world. the new type, the national variant, mainly belongs to the second and third variants. the genetic form of the g-6-pd gene is localized to x q28, and the g-6-pd deficiency is a sexually incomplete dominant inheritance. therefore, a male with a variant gene will develop the disease, and the abnormal gene will not be passed from father to son. it will only be passed from mother to son. in women, only one of the two x chromosomes is active in each cell. female g-6-pd lacks heterozygotes and two red blood cell populations. g-6-pd deficiency the ratio of g-6-pd-deficient cells to normal cells varies greatly between cells and normal cells. some heterozygous females appear to be completely normal, while others show complete abnormalities. this is significant for g-6-pd heterozygotes. variability is the result of certain characteristics of the x chromosome inactivation process, because x chromosome inactivation is random, and sometimes more paternal x chromosomes are activated cell clones with proliferative advantages, during x chromosome inactivation and maturation many generations of cells, even if one clone has a small selective growth advantage over the other, results in a significant difference between normal and missing cell numbers. thus, g-6-pd depleted red blood cells in the peripheral blood of female heterozygotes. ratio to normal red blood cells this significant difference can lead to different clinical manifestations. in 1986, persico, martlni, etc. successfully cloned the human g-6-pd gene by different methods and obtained the cdna sequence, so that the g-6-pd research can reach the gene level, enabling people to be at the gene level. to investigate the primary structural changes of proteins lacking g-6-pd. in 1991, ellson et al. determined the full sequence of human g-6-pd genome. the g-6-pd gene is about 18 kb in length and consists of 13 exons and 12 introns. it encodes a g-6-pd protein consisting of 515 amino acids. in recent years, the cloned g-6-pd gene technology has been applied. or pcr combined with direct sequence analysis has identified more than 120 genetic variants, except for 3 nucleotide deletions, all of which are single or multiple base substitutions, and the g-6-pd gene is a housekeeping gene. (homekeeping gene), therefore may be necessary for survival, mutations (such as deletions or nonsense mutations) that result in complete loss of g-6-pd activity may be lethal, except for exons 1, 3, 13 mutations, 15 point mutations have been found in chinese, and existing studies have confirmed that different regions, more than 50% of patients of different nationalities are 1376gLt and 1388gLa, causing non-spherical cell hemolytic anemia mutations concentrated in the hydroxyl group of the enzyme the terminal, the 362-446 amino acid fragment, and most of the mutations leading to other diseases are concentrated at the amino terminus of the enzyme, the most interesting is the mutation of g-6-pd a-, a- has genetic heterogeneity sex, it has base substitutions in two parts, one of which is 376aLg, the other can therefore, 202gLa, 680gLa or 968tLc, a- frequency in african americans is 12%, and another variant commonly found in africans is g-6-pd a, in african americans. the frequency is 20%, and the mutation of g-6-pd a is 376aLg, which is a certain mutation in g-6-pd a-. therefore, beutler et al. think that g-6-pd a- appears from g. -6-pdb (wild type)Lg-6-pd aLg-6-pda-, the high frequency of natural selection (malaria) a- was preserved. according to the traditional biochemical classification method, it can be divided into the same g-6-pd biochemical variant. it may be caused by different gene mutations, that is, the gene variants are different in nature. for example, g-6-pd(-) has three types. gene mutation: 1202gLa, 376aLg; 2680gLt, 376aLg; 3968tLg, 376aLg, previously thought to be some different biochemical variants, the essence of which is caused by the same base mutation, such as g -6-pd biochemical variants kaiping, anant, dhon, petrieh-like, and sappoto-like are all 1388gLa mutations (463 argLhis). (b) pathogenesis g-6-pd activity decreased exponentially with cell aging, the normal half-life of normal enzyme (g-6-pd b) was 62 days, reticulocytes were twice as active as mixed cell population, and aging the cell is only half active, and the activity of g-6-pd a- is normal in reticulocytes, but it is rapidly reduced afterwards, with a half-life of only 13 days, and the instability of the g-6-pd mediterranean type is even more pronounced. the half-life is only a few hours. the exact mechanism of g-6-pd deficiency of immature destruction of red blood cells is not fully understood. the mechanism of different hemolysis syndrome may be different. it is thought to be mainly related to the decrease of red blood cell reduced glutathione (gsh) and the peroxidation of red blood cells inside and outside. the product is detoxified by reduction by glutathione peroxidase (gshpx) and consumes gsh. gsh is oxidized to oxidized glutathione (gssg) or combined with hemoglobin cysteine to form a mixed disulfide compound (gss). -hb), in normal red blood cells, gssg and gss-hb are immediately supplemented by gsh as a supplement to gsh with the participation of reduced coenzyme ii (nadph), g-6-pd lacks gsh of red blood cells after being consumed, sufficient nadph could not be obtained to restore gssg and gss-hb. gsh could not be replenished, gsh content decreased rapidly, and malignant decrease was formed. as a result, gssg and gss-hb accumulated in red blood cells and denatured to form heinz bodies. the red blood cells are plasticized and deformed, and when passing through the spleen sinus, the red blood cells are not easily deformed and are blocked and destroyed. in recent years, more and more studies have suggested that g-6-pd deficiency erythrocyte hemolysis is associated with erythrocyte peroxidation damage. red blood cells in the blood circulation are in a high oxygen environment, and the erythrocyte membrane is always surrounded by intracellular and extracellular peroxides. in erythrocytes, oxyhemoglobin is continuously converted to methemoglobin, which is accompanied by the production of superoxide anion, which protects against various external and intrinsic peroxide damage. red blood cells have a series of protective mechanisms against oxidation damage, including peroxidation. hydrogenase (cat), peroxidase (gshpx), superoxide dismutase (sod), gsh, etc., if these natural protective mechanisms are defective or activated, too many harmful oxygen derivatives, hemoglobin and erythrocyte membrane will be affected peroxidation damage, and can cause irreversible damage, leading to red blood cell destruction, hemolysis, it is now believed that the peroxide formed in the red blood cells of g-6-pd deficiency is easily damaged, the root cause is the insufficient production of nadph, and this results in low gsh production, functional lack of cat and gshpx, antioxidant dysfunction, and increased oxidative vulnerability.","['splenomegaly', 'hypoxemia', 'back pain', 'tiredness', 'abdominal pain', 'dizziness', 'no urine', 'less urine', 'kidney failure']",['cholelithiasis'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
iron deficiency anemia,"irondeficiency anemia (ida) is a common anemia caused by the lack of iron in the body, which affects the synthesis of hemoglobin. before the production of red blood cells is restricted, the iron storage in the body is exhausted, which is called iron deficiency.this anemia is characterized by the lack of stainable iron in the bone marrow, liver, spleen and other tissues, serum iron concentration and serum transferrin saturation are reduced. typical cases of anemia are small cell hypopigmentation.the disease is a common type of anemia, which is common in all parts of the world. the causes of iron deficiency anemia are: first, the increased demand for iron and insufficient intake, second, poor absorption of iron, and third, excessive blood loss, etc. hemoglobin and red blood cells survive and anemia occurs.","iron deficiency anemia is mostly preventable. 1. do a good job in feeding guidance: promote breastfeeding, and timely add supplemental foods with high iron content and high iron absorption rate, such as liver, lean meat, fish, etc., and pay attention to the reasonable mix of diets, and appropriate iron supplements for pregnant and lactating women. . 2, infant foods add appropriate amount of iron for reinforcement. 3, for premature infants, low birth weight infants should be given early iron prevention. 4. large-scale parasitic control work should be carried out in the hookworm endemic area. 5. all kinds of diseases of chronic gastrointestinal bleedingshould becured in time.","children need increased iron during the growing period and during lactation, especially in premature infants, twins or mothers with anemia. the original iron storage of infants is insufficient. if only those with less iron are fed, after the teething if you don't replenish eggs, vegetables, meat and animal liver, etc., you can cause iron deficiency anemia, increase the amount of iron in pregnancy and lactation, plus gastrointestinal dysfunction during pregnancy, stomach acid. lack, affecting iron sleep, especially after multiple pregnancies, it is easy to cause iron deficiency anemia, adolescents due to rapid growth, increased iron demand, especially young women, due to menstrual blood loss, if the food consumed for a long time is insufficient iron deficiency can also occur. the most common cause is insufficient iron content in food, partial eclipse or malabsorption. heme iron in food is easily absorbed, and is not affected by food composition and gastric acid. non-heme iron needs to be first. it can be absorbed by fe2, and the absorption of iron, vegetables, cereals, phosphates, phytic acid, tannins, etc. in tea can affect the absorption of iron. the daily iron requirement for adults is about 1 to 2 mg, and the male 1 mg/d is enough. the need for iron for women of reproductive age and for adolescents with growth and development should be 1.5 to 2 mg/d, such as iron in the diet and stored in the body. iron is sufficient, and iron deficiency is rarely found. other causes of insufficient iron intake are drug or gastrointestinal disorders that affect iron absorption. some metals such as gallium and magnesium are ingested, and calcium carbonate in antacids. and magnesium sulfate, h2 inhibitors taken during ulcer disease, can inhibit the absorption of iron, atrophic gastritis, gastric acid and duodenal surgery, the reduction of gastric acid affects the absorption of iron, etc., are the cause of insufficient iron intake in addition, the average blood loss during pregnancy is 1300ml (about 680mg iron). it needs 2.5mg of iron per day. in the 6th month after pregnancy, 3 to 7mg of iron is needed every day, and the requirement of iron during lactation is increased by 0.5~1mg/d. insufficient supplementation will lead to a negative balance of iron. for example, the need for iron is increased in multiple pregnancies. each blood donation of blood donors is equivalent to 200mg of lost iron, about 8% of male blood donors and 23% of female blood donors. serum ferritin is reduced, as many times in the short term , the situation will be worse. because 2/3 of the total iron in the body is present in the red blood cells, repeated, a large amount of blood loss can significantly consume iron stores in the body, hookworm disease causes chronic small amount of intestinal bleeding, repeated upper bleeding of upper gastrointestinal ulcer, many years of anorectal bleeding or long-term loss of women's excessive menstrual flow, eventually resulting in insufficient iron storage in the body, resulting in iron deficiency anemia, in addition, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, mechanical hemolysis caused by artificial mechanical heart valves, and idiopathic lung hemosiderin can cause anemia due to long-term urinary iron loss. normal people lose about 1mg of iron from the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and skin epithelial cells every day. women in menstruation, childbirth and breastfeeding there is more iron loss, and excessive iron loss in the clinic is often caused by gastrointestinal bleeding in men, while women are often due to menorrhagia. excited iron can be lost with aging and detachment of gastrointestinal epithelial cells. in atrophic gastritis, major gastrectomy and steatorrhea, epithelial cell renewal rate is increased, so free iron loss is also increased, and iron deficiency not only causes blood redness. the synthesis of hormones is reduced, and the activity of iron-containing enzymes (such as cytochrome oxidase) in red blood cells is reduced, which affects the electron transport system, which can cause abnormalities in lipids, proteins and sugar metabolism, leading to abnormal red blood cells, which are easily broken in the spleen and shortened. its life cycle. the iron in the human body is in a closed loop. under normal circumstances, the absorption and excretion of iron maintains a dynamic balance. the human body generally does not lack iron. it only causes an increase in iron intake and chronic blood loss. long-term iron negative balance leads to iron deficiency, and the cause of iron deficiency can be divided into two categories: insufficient iron intake and excessive loss. [pathogenesis] iron is an essential trace element in human body. it exists in all living cells. in addition to participating in hemoglobin synthesis, iron participates in some biochemical processes in the body, including mitochondrial electron transfer, catecholamine metabolism and dna synthesis. know that a variety of enzymes require iron, such as peroxidase, cytochrome c reductase, succinate dehydrogenase, ribonucleic acid reductase and xanthine oxidase and other proteases and oxidoreductases have iron, such as lack, will affect cells the redox function causes a variety of dysfunctions. decreased activity of iron-containing enzyme, affecting the oxidative glycolysis cycle of cell mitochondria, keratinizing and degeneration of epithelial cells with rapid metabolism, atrophy of digestive system mucosa, reduction of gastric acid secretion, dehydrogenation of 汐-glycerophosphate in skeletal muscle during iron deficiency reduced enzymes, easy to cause increased accumulation of lactic acid after exercise, so that muscle function and physical strength decline, iron-containing monoamine oxidase plays an important role in the synthesis and decomposition of some nerve transport agents (such as dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin) in the absence of iron, the activity of monoamine oxidase is reduced, which may affect the development and intelligence of the nerve. the developing red blood cells require iron, protoporphyrin and globin to synthesize hemoglobin, and hemoglobin synthesis is insufficient to cause hypopigmentation anemia. there is still a different view on the relationship between iron deficiency and infection, macrophage function and spleen during iron deficiency. natural killer cell activity is obviously impaired; neutrophil myeloperoxidase and oxygen respiratory burst function are reduced; lymphocyte transformation and migration inhibitory factors are blocked, and cellular immune function is decreased, but others emphasize that iron is also a bacterial growth needed, it is believed that iron deficiency has a certain protective effect on the body, and iron is more prone to infection than iron deficiency.","['syncope', 'heart failure', 'to liqin', 'index finger nail depression', 'dysphagia', 'tinnitus', 'nail uplift', 'hook dermatitis', 'disgusting']",['intracranial hypertension syndrome'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
anemia caused by excessive hemolysis,"hemolytic anemia is an anemia that occurs when red blood cell destruction is accelerated and bone marrow hematopoietic function is insufficiently compensated.the average survival time of normal red blood cells is about 120 days, and the survival time of red blood cells of hemolytic anemia is often shortened to 15 to 20 days, and the shortest is only a few days.premature destruction of red blood cells can occur extravascularly or intravascularly.extravascular hemolysis, that is, red blood cells are destroyed and destroyed by phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen and liver.intravascular hemolysis is the rupture of red blood cells directly in the blood circulation, and hemoglobin is released into the plasma.when hemolysis increases, the hematopoietic function of the bone marrow can be compensated, and anemia can occur.this condition is called compensatory hemolytic disease.however, if the hematopoietic function of the bone marrow has accelerated and is still slower than the rate at which red blood cells are destroyed, hemolytic anemia occurs.","the treatment principles can be summarized as follows: (1) removal of the cause: many hemolytic anemias have clear incentives, such as faba bean disease caused by eating broad beans; drug-induced hemolytic anemia is caused by taking drugs; infection can aggravate the original hemolysis or hemolysis, etc., therefore, the cause of hemolytic anemia should be removed first. (2) resection of the spleen: suitable for abnormal red blood cells mainly in the spleen destruction, such as hereditary spherocytosis. (3) blood transfusion: it is one of the important measures to treat anemia, which can alleviate the symptoms of anemia in patients, but it may also bring serious reactions, so it is necessary to pay attention to the indications of blood transfusion. (4) immunosuppressive agents: can inhibit the immune response, is effective against immune thrombolytic anemia, and is basically ineffective against other types of anemia. (5) prevention of serious complications: complications caused by hemolysis are more serious, such as renal failure, shock, heart failure, etc., in the treatment of hemolytic anemia should be early prevention of complications, and strive for early detection, early treatment.","defects in the structure of the erythrocyte membrane can cause membrane permeability, hardness abnormality, or instability and breakage.in most cases, the defect is one or more backbone proteins, and the morphology of red blood cells is also abnormal.these hereditary membrane diseases include hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary neutropenia.paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, whose erythrocyte membrane is abnormally sensitive to complement, but its membrane defect is an acquired abnormality. abnormal hemoglobin structure makes hemoglobin insoluble or unstable, leading to red blood cell stiffness and finally hemolysis.such as sickle cell anemia or unstable hemoglobinopathy.in thalassemia, excessive globin chains precipitate, causing red blood cells to harden and destroy and cause hemolytic anemia. the lack of erythrocyte enzymes to maintain hemoglobin and membrane thiol (sulfhydryl) in a reduced state or to maintain a sufficient level of atp for cation exchange can lead to hemolytic anemia, which can be divided into two categories: 1 erythrocyte anaerobic lack of enzymes in glycolysis (such as pyruvate kinase), 2 lack of enzymes in erythrocyte phosphate hexose bypass (such as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase). external defects, usually acquired, can be hemolyzed by chemical, mechanical or physical factors, biological and immunological factors.hemolysis can be in the blood vessels or outside the blood vessels.","['back pain', 'proteinuria', 'syncope', 'weakness']",['heart failure'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hemolytic anemia,"hemolytic anemia refers to an anemia that occurs when red blood cell destruction is accelerated and bone marrow hematopoietic function is insufficiently compensated.if the bone marrow can increase erythropoiesis and is sufficient to compensate for the shortened survival of red blood cells, no anemia will occur. this state is called compensatory hemolytic disease.","(1) prevention of cold agglutinin disease, cold hemoglobinuria patients should avoid cold, the usual naked parts should not be ignored, there is no obvious incentive for the onset of warm antibody type aiha hemolysis, some patients with seizures and trauma, surgery, pregnancy, spirit relevant to stimulation, should try to avoid, explain the basic concept of the disease to patients, prevent and cure points, explain the importance of prevention and implementation methods, encourage patients to self-train and adjust under the conditions of adequate drug treatment to improve physical fitness. (2) conditioning 1, life conditioning infection, fatigue, mental stimulation, etc. often become the cause of acute hemolysis of the disease, life conditioning is essential, to live regularly, with the climate change in time to increase or decrease clothing, avoid exogenous, excessive fatigue, including physical labor, god's work and excessive labor, can aggravate the disease, should be avoided, encourage patients to self-train according to physical conditions, in order to improve physical fitness and disease resistance. 2, diet conditioning this disease pathogenesis is a virtual inclusion, disease for a long time for the qi and blood two losses, even the spleen and kidney are empty, the plain is mainly based on virtual or virtual, taboo cold fruit to avoid damage to the spleen and stomach, spicy and greasy the product should also avoid or eat less, always care for the spleen and stomach, the following diet can help the disease to recover: (1) wolfberry jujube millet porridge: 20 grams of medlar, jujube 50 grams, 20 grams of yam, 20 grams of peanuts, millet 50 grams, add 150ml of water, porridge to eat, for hemolysis, intermittently see pale, tired of poor. (2) ginseng, cordyceps stewed chicken: 10 grams of ginseng, cordyceps sinensis, one black bean, 20 grams of lentils, add water, add salt and oil to simmer for 2 hours, drink soup and eat meat, treat hemolysis intermittent qi and blood deficiency, from sweat, shortness of breath, lazy words, and witnesses with yin deficiency. 3, mental conditioning to treat diseases correctly, avoid heavy physical labor, avoid mental stress, adjust the mind, do not be excited, can exercise properly, such as tai chi, to enhance physical fitness, but those who suffer from qi and blood deficiency do not practice qigong, so as to avoid qi and blood consumption increase the qi and blood deficiency.","according to the shortening of red blood cell life, it can be divided into erythrocyte intrinsic defects and hemolytic anemia caused by external factors. hemolytic anemia caused by internal defects of red blood cells: (1) defects of erythrocyte membrane. (b) hemoglobin structure or production defects. (3) defects in erythrocyte enzymes.hemolytic anemia caused by external defects of red blood cells: external defects, usually acquired, red blood cells can be hemolyzed by chemical, mechanical or physical factors, biological and immunological factors, and hemolysis can be in blood vessels. it can also be outside the blood vessels.","['circulatory failure', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'carpal sag of the distal extremity', 'stationary doctor', 'face pale', 'spleen hyperthyroidism', 'kidney failure', 'nose color pale']",['shock'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hemorrhagic shock,"a large number of blood loss caused by shock called hemorrhagic shock (hemorrhagic shock), common in bleeding caused by trauma, peptic ulcer bleeding, esophageal variceal rupture, bleeding caused by obstetrics and gynecology diseases, etc., whether shock occurs after blood loss depends not only on blood loss the amount also depends on the speed of blood loss.shock is often caused by rapid, large (more than 30 to 35% of total blood) blood loss without timely replenishment.typical clinical manifestations are pale skin, damp cold, may have spots, increased heart rate, dry mouth, shortness of breath, changes in consciousness, blood pressure and so on.","1. actively prevent infection. 2, do a good job of on-site treatment of trauma, such as timely hemostasis, analgesia, heat preservation and so on. 3, patients with blood loss or excessive fluid loss (such as vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, a lot of sweating, etc.) should promptly replenish or transfuse blood.","microcirculation ischemic phase: the characteristics of microcirculation changes in this period are: 1 micro-arterial, posterior micro-arterial and capillary sphincter contraction, microcirculation perfusion flow decreased sharply, pressure decreased; 2 venules and venules were more sensitive to catecholamines low, contraction is lighter; 3 arteriovenous anastomosis may have different degrees of openness, blood from the arterioles through the arteriovenous anastomosis directly into the venules. the key change that causes microcirculatory ischemia is the sympathetic nervous-adrenal medullary system. different types of shock can cause sympathy through different mechanismsthere is a decrease in cardiac output during adrenal medullary shock and cardiogenic shock. arterial blood pressure reduction can excite the sympathetic-adrenal medulla system through sinus arch reflex; in most endotoxic shocks, endotoxin can directly stimulate sympathy - the adrenal medullary system is strongly excited. sympathetic excitation: the total effect of increased catecholamine release on the cardiovascular system is to increase peripheral total resistance and increase cardiac output, but the response of blood vessels in different organs is very different, skin, abdominal visceral and renal blood vessels, due to it is rich in sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers, and 汐 receptors have an advantage. therefore, when sympathetic nerves are excited and catecholamines increase, the small arteries, venules, arterioles and capillary anterior red muscles of these sites contract. because the sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers of the arterioles are the most densely distributed, the anterior capillaries of the capillaries are the most reactive to catecholamines, so they contract most strongly. as a result, the anterior capillary resistance is significantly increased, the microcirculation perfusion flow is drastically reduced, and the capillaries are reduced. the average blood pressure is significantly reduced. only a small amount of blood flows through the direct pathway and a few true capillaries into the venules, venules, and tissue, resulting in severe ischemic hypoxia. the distribution of sympathetic vasoconstrictors in the cerebral vessels is the least, and the alpha receptor density also low, the caliber can be no significant change, although the coronary artery also has sympathetic nerve branches , there are 汐 and 汕 receptors, but has increased sympathetic nerve activity and catecholamine activity by strengthening the heart, improving metabolism vasodilator metabolites that adenosine increased the particular coronary artery. sympathetic excitability and reduced blood volume can also activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, while angiotensin ii has a strong vasoconstrictor effect, including contraction of the coronary arteries. in addition, increased catecholamines can also stimulate platelets to produce more thromboxane a2 (txa2), while txa2 also has a strong vasoconstrictor effect. 1, normal conditions ( 1) arteriovenous anastomosis is closed. (2) only 20% of the capillaries are open in turn, with blood perfusion. (3) the opening and closing of capillaries is regulated by the relaxation and contraction of the anterior capillaries of the capillaries. 2, microcirculation ischemic period ( 1) sympathetic nerve excitability and adrenaline, norepinephrine secretion increased, small arteries, arterioles, posterior micro-arteries, contraction of the anterior capillaries. (2) the arteriovenous anastomosis is open, and the blood flows directly from the arteriole to the venule. (3) insufficient blood perfusion of capillaries, tissue hypoxia. 3, microcirculation congestion period ( 1) small arteries and arterioles contraction, arteriovenous anastomosis is still open, blood into the capillaries is still very small. (2) due to hypoxia, histamine, bradykinin, hydrogen ion and other vasodilators increase, post-arterioles and capillaries sphincter relax, capillaries open, blood vessels expand, and blood flow into capillaries is slow. (3) due to sympathetic excitation, the secretion of adrenaline and norepinephrine is increased (possibly with the action of histamine), the venules and venules are contracted, and the post-capillary resistance is increased, resulting in telangiectasia and congestion. 4, microcirculation coagulation period ( 1) due to severe hypoxia, acidosis, capillary wall damage and increased permeability, capillary blood concentration, blood stasis; in addition, blood coagulation increased, the results in the microcirculation produces disseminated intravascular coagulation. (2) due to the formation of microthrombus, more severe hypoxia and metabolic disorders, intracellular lysosomal rupture, tissue cell necrosis, causing severe dysfunction in various organs. (3) due to coagulation, coagulation factors (such as prothrombin, fibrinogen, etc.) and platelets are consumed in large quantities, fibrin degradation products are increased, and blood coagulability is reduced; the blood vessel wall is damaged again, followed by extensive bleeding. txa2 also has a strong vasoconstrictor effect. in addition, the lysosomal hydrolase-myocardial inhibitor system also plays a role in the development of stage i microcirculation ischemia. in shock, ischemia, hypoxia and acid are mainly caused by decreased blood perfusion of the pancreas. poisoning can rupture the lysosomes of pancreatic exocrine cells and release cathepsin, which can decompose tissue proteins to produce myocardial depressant factor (mdf). after the small molecule peptide mdf enters the bloodstream, it causes myocardial contraction. the weakening of the force inhibits the phagocytic function of the mononuclear phagocytic system, and also causes the small blood vessels of the abdominal viscera to contract, thereby further aggravating the ischemia of microcirculation in these areas. the main clinical manifestations of this period are: pale skin, cold limbs, cold sweat, and reduced urine output; because of increased peripheral resistance, systolic blood pressure can be not significantly reduced, while diastolic blood pressure is increased, pulse pressure is reduced, and pulse rate is fine. conscious, irritated, and so on. the microcirculation changes in this period have certain compensatory significance. the small arteries such as skin and abdominal organs contract, which can increase the peripheral resistance to maintain blood pressure, and reduce the blood flow of these tissues and organs to ensure the blood of important organs such as the heart and brain. supply; increased capillary anterior resistance, reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure, promotes tissue fluid into the blood vessels to increase plasma volume; in addition, arteriovenous anastomosis is open, venous contraction reduces the venous volume (normally about 70% of blood is in the vein) it can speed up and increase the amount of blood returning, and is also conducive to the maintenance of blood pressure and blood supply to the heart and brain. however, due to the lack of oxygen in most tissues and organs due to insufficient perfusion of microcirculation arterial blood, it will lead to further development of shock, such as early detection. active rescue, timely replenishment of blood volume, reduce the stress response of the drama, can quickly improve the microcirculation and restore blood pressure, prevent shock from further deterioration, and turn to safety. microcirculation congestion period: in the cyclical ischemic period of shock, if the rescue is not early, and the microcirculation is improved, local vasoactive substances (such as histamine, kinin, lactic acid, adenosine, etc.) may be caused by persistent and severe hypoxia. increased, posterior micro-arterial and capillary sphincter relaxation, microcirculation capacity expansion, congestion, development of shock microcirculation congestion, this period of microcirculation changes are characterized by: 1 post-arterioles and capillary sphincter relaxation (due to topical acid poisoning, reduced reactivity to catecholamines), capillary opening is large, some are irregular lateral cystic expansion (micro-blood pool formation), and microcirculation volume is enlarged; 2 venules and venules are resistant to local acidosis larger, catecholamines can still cause contraction (histamine can also shrink the venules and venules of the liver, lungs, etc.), the post-capillary resistance increases, and the microcirculation blood flow is slow; 3 microvascular wall permeability increases, plasma oozing, stagnant blood flow; 4 due to blood concentration, increased hematocrit, red blood cell aggregation, white blood cell impaction, platelet adhesion and aggregation and other changes in blood rheology, make microcirculation blood flow slow or even stop; 5 due to microcirculation congestion, increased pressure, less arterial blood entering the microcirculation (the small arteries and arterioles are still in a contracted state due to sympathetic nerves), due to massive blood deposition in the microcirculation, the amount of blood returning to the heart is reduced, which further reduces the cardiac output and aggravates the development of shock. the mechanism of microcirculation changes during ischemic hypoxia is due to the above microcirculation changes. although a large amount of blood is accumulated in the microcirculation, the arterial blood perfusion flow will be further reduced, and the skin color of the patient will gradually become pale, especially the mouth and finger. because the venous return flow and cardiac output are further reduced, the patient's vein collapses and the filling is slow; the arterial pressure is significantly reduced, the pulse pressure is small, and the pulse is fine; the heart and brain are insufficiently supplied by blood, and atp production is reduced, and the cardiac contractility is expressed. attenuation (low heart sound), indifferent expression or unconsciousness, serious heart, kidney, lung failure, this is a critical state of shock, should be immediately rescued, rehydration, relieve small blood vessels, give oxygen, correct acidosis, to dredge microcirculation and prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation. microcirculation coagulation period: the development from the hemorrhagic phase of the microcirculation to the microcirculation coagulation phase is a manifestation of the deterioration of shock. it is characterized by the presence of fibers in the microcirculation (especially the capillary veins, venules, venules) on the basis of microcirculation congestion. protein thrombosis, and often focal or diffuse hemorrhage; tissue cells degeneration and necrosis due to severe hypoxia. disseminated intravascular coagulation is closely related to shock. the pathological changes caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation and how it causes shock or exacerbation of shock have been discussed in the chapter on disseminated intravascular coagulation. here, we briefly summarize how shock causes disseminated intravascular coagulation. 1. stress response increases blood coagulability, causing shock causes (such as trauma, burns, bleeding, etc.) and shock itself is a strong stimulus that can cause stress, sympathetic excitation and pituitary-adrenal gland enhanced cortical activity, increased blood platelets and clotting factors, enhanced platelet adhesion and aggregation, providing the necessary material basis for blood clotting. 2. the release and activation of clotting factors, and some causes of shock (such as trauma, burns, etc.) can release and activate clotting factors themselves. for example, damaged tissues can release a large amount of tissue thromboplastin, and start exogenous sources. sexual coagulation process; large area burns destroy a large number of red blood cells, and the phospholipids and red blood cells in the red blood cell membrane destroy the released adp, which promotes the blood coagulation process. 3, microcirculatory disorders, tissue hypoxia, local histamine, kinins, lactic acid, etc., on the one hand cause capillary dilation and congestion, increased permeability, slow blood flow, increased blood erythrocyte viscosity, there are conducive to thrombosis; on the other hand damage capillary endothelial cells, expose gelatin, activate factor xii and cause platelet adhesion and aggregation. 4. hypoxia reduced the function of mononuclear phagocytic system, and could not clear thrombin enzyme, thrombin and fibrin in time. as a result, disseminated intravascular coagulation occurred under the above factors. once disseminated intravascular coagulation occurs, the microcirculatory disorder will be more serious, and the shock condition will be further deteriorated. this is because: 1 extensive microvascular obstruction further aggravates the microcirculatory disorder and further reduces the blood flow to the heart; 2 coagulation substance consumption, following factors such as activation of fibrinolysis cause bleeding, thereby reducing blood volume; 3 soluble fibrin multimers and their cleavage products can block the mononuclear phagocytic system, thus preventing endotoxin from the intestines from being sufficiently eliminated. due to the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and the increasing aggravation of microcirculation, the systemic hypoxia and acidosis will become more and more serious due to the severe deficiency of systemic microcirculation perfusion caused by blood pressure reduction; severe acidosis it can rupture the lysosomal membrane in the cell, release lysosomal enzymes (such as proteolytic enzymes, etc.) and certain shock drivers (such as endotoxin), which can cause serious or irreversible damage to the cells, thus the functional metabolic disorders of various important organs, including the heart and brain, are also more serious (detailed), which causes great difficulty in treatment, so this period is also called the refractory period of shock.","['shock', 'stationary doctor', 'pulmonary wedge pressure (p...', 'peripheral vein filling', 'venous oxygen saturation...', 'blood is concentrated', 'serum sodium increased' ]","['cerebral thrombosis', 'consciousness disorder']",['emergency department'],"['timely blood transfusion, surgical treatment, drug support treatment']"

idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (itp) is the most common hemorrhagic disease in children. it is characterized by spontaneous bleeding, thrombocytopenia, prolonged bleeding time and poor blood clot dysfunction. this disease is an immune response-related hemorrhage. sexual diseases can be classified into acute and chronic according to the patient's course of disease within 6 months or more than 6 months. the two types are different in age, etiology, pathogenesis and prognosis.","first, prevention: prevent colds, closely observe changes in purple spots, such as density, color, size, etc., pay attention to body temperature, consciousness and bleeding, help to understand the prognosis and outcome of the disease, so as to timely deal with, avoid trauma, bleeding severe cases must be absolutely bed rest, chronic patients, according to the actual situation, appropriate exercise, avoid seven emotions, maintain a good mood, diet should be soft, if there is gastrointestinal bleeding, should be semi-liquid or fluid, avoid smoking tobacco and spicy stimulating things, spotted itch, can be rubbed with calamine lotion or jiuhua powder lotion, pay attention to skin hygiene, avoid scratching the skin bow with infection. second, conditioning: (a) life conditioning 1. the incidence is more urgent, severe bleeding needs absolute bed rest, should pay attention to rest during the remission period, to avoid overwork, to avoid trauma. 2. chronic purpura, you can exercise according to physical strength.

(3) mental conditioning: regulate emotions and avoid mood swings or mental stimulation.","most scholars believe that itp is a thrombocytopenia caused by the body's immune response to its own platelet-associated antigen, but the essence of platelet-associated antigen is still inconclusive. in 1982, van leenwen reported that autoantibodies in some itp patients are directed against platelet membrane glycoprotein iib. the antigenic determinant of the /iiia (gpiib/iiia) molecule, and later found that the gpib/ix complex on the platelets of some itp patients is also the target antigen of autoantibodies, suggesting that itp is a group of itself caused by different related antigenic determinants. in immunological diseases, the membrane antigen sites that can bind to antibodies are quite extensive. therefore, the platelet autoantigens of itp patients mainly include gpiib/iiia, gpib/ix, and other antigen types that are not fully elucidated. the value of antiplatelet antibody testing for the diagnosis and treatment of itp is still controversial, but there is no doubt that the production of autoantibodies plays an important role in the pathogenesis of itp. the rate of thrombocytosis in patients with itp can be reduced, normal or increased, and the mean platelet production rate is close to normal, but the average lifespan of platelets in the blood vessels of itp patients is shortened (only 2.9 days, normal average is 8.0 days), mainly due to platelets. the damage is increased. normally, the number of megakaryocytes in the itp patients is normal or increased. the increase in the number of megakaryocytes may be related to the increase of platelet destruction and the compensatory proliferation of megakaryocytes. because anti-platelet antibodies act on megakaryocytes or their progenitor cells at the same time. it may also cause platelets not to be produced. (1) bleeding mechanism of chronic itp: 1 increased platelet destruction caused by platelet-associated antibodies is the main cause of bleeding. 2 antibodies immobilized on platelet-associated antigens cause abnormal platelet function. 3 antibodies can also damage capillary endothelial cells, causing increased permeability and bleeding. (2) bleeding mechanism of acute itp: 1 platelets that bind to immune complexes are simultaneously engulfed by macrophages, and are destroyed and reduced. 2 the release of a large amount of protease during phagocytosis increases capillary permeability. (3) the immune complex can fix complement, and the cleavage of c3 and c5 can cause histamine release, resulting in vascular permeability changes and bleeding. pathogenesis, platelet destruction (1) platelet destruction mechanism of chronic itp: platelet destruction of chronic itp is caused by binding of platelet antibodies to their related antigens: paig binds to platelet-specific antigen through fab segment, and its exposed fc segment can interact with mononuclear macrophages the fc receptors of the macrophages of the system bind, causing the platelets to be destroyed by phagocytosis. the megakaryocytes also have related antigens, so the function of generating platelets is also impaired. when the surface of the platelets has more igg antibodies, igg dimers can be formed. activation of complement c1q, followed by activation of components of the complement system, c3 cleavage product c3b attached to the surface of platelets, and binding to the c3b receptor of macrophages, also leading to platelet phagocytosis, platelet destruction and macrophage activity levels it also has a relationship. for example, when a virus is infected, the number of fc or c3b receptors on macrophages increases, affinity increases, and platelets are more easily destroyed. this may explain a clinically common phenomenon, that is, itp patients are in the virus. when the infection is infected, the condition is often aggravated. (2) platelet destruction mechanism of acute itp: acute itp is more common in children and is often associated with viral infection. acute type is an immune complex disease caused by natural immune defense response after viral infection. the mechanism of platelet destruction is: 1 virus infection can directly damage megakaryocytes and platelets: it can also cause platelet membrane antigenic changes, induce the production of autoantibodies. 2 sequestration and destruction of platelets by mononuclear macrophage system: a. formation of immune complexes (ic) in vivo: antiviral antibodies bind to platelet-adsorbed viruses, and can also bind antibodies to circulating non-platelet antigens, and then to platelet membranes. the fc receptor binds, binds to and eliminates circulating immune complexes that are normally normal mononuclear macrophages, but causes thrombocytopenia; b. antiplatelet autoantibodies are also present in acute itp patients, except for gpiib/ in addition to iiia and gpib/ix autoantibodies, there may also be gpv autoantibodies. anti-platelet antibody (1) detection of anti-platelet antibodies: in 1975, dixon and rosse first directly used quantitative methods to detect immunoglobulins on the platelet surface of patients with itp, called platelet-associated antibodies (paigg), and found a negative correlation between paigg and platelet count. relationship, after that, with the improvement of methodology, ria, elisa and other methods have been successively introduced. the concentration of normal human paigg/106 platelets is 1-11 ng, while the platelet pa igg content of itp patients is 4-13 times higher than that of normal people. although the results vary from report to report, the results of different reports have been shown to be significantly higher in most itp patients (78.6% to 100%) than in the normal population. the number of paigg is negatively correlated with platelet count and also with platelets. life expectancy is negatively correlated; paigg levels reflect clinical signs and are associated with the severity of the disease, and as the platelet count increases as the treatment is effective, paigg decreases or falls to normal. further studies have found that bacterial sepsis, active systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), infectious mononucleosis with thrombocytopenia, graves disease, hashimoto's thyroiditis, lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other diseases of paigg the level may increase. it is considered that paigg is not a specific antibody related to itp. the interpretation of paigg should be cautious. in 1983, lo bugli and other 125i-labeled monoclonal antibody-anti-human igg were used to determine paigg, and normal control platelet surface was found. paigg is (169I79) igg molecules; igp patients have platelet surface paigg of 790F13095 igg molecules; non-immune thrombocytopenic patients have platelet surface paigg of (246I156) igg molecules, this data suggests that although paigg is elevated it is not a specific indicator of itp diagnosis, but it still has important reference value in the diagnosis of itp. combined with clinical signs, thrombocytopenia, elevated paigg, if other secondary diseases (such as sle, thyroid disease, lymphoproliferative disorders) and infection, etc.), should be highly suspected of the possibility of itp; if paigg is negative, it is likely not itp. (2) types of platelet-related antibodies: with the in-depth study of itp, it was found that not all itp thrombocytopenia is mediated by paigg, and there may be other factors affecting thrombocytopenia, such as paigm, paiga and pac3, paigm high binding rate and cohesive ability, 1 molecule of igm can activate complement and promote platelet destruction. it is reported that paigm level has the strongest correlation with platelet count. paigm may have a dominant role in the pathogenesis of itp, and there are reports that patients only there is an increase in pac3 and no increase in paigg, suggesting that complement can destroy platelets alone in the absence of platelet-associated antibodies, but many patients have platelet surface-associated antibodies belonging to paigg. in most cases, paigg is present alone, accounting for approximately 70%, as well as paigg and paigm. and (or) paiga coexist, a small number of patients, especially acute itp, paigm antibody alone, igg1 is most common in igg antibody subtypes, igg1 often coexists with igg3, igg4, and igg2 coexisting is rare. (3) anti-platelet antibody production and platelet destruction: paigg is known to be mainly produced in the spleen. other lymphoid tissues and bone marrow may also be important sites for the production of paigg. it is currently believed that the main organs of itp and platelet destruction are in the spleen, liver and bone marrow, in which the spleen is the most important, the normal spleen contains a large number of macrophages, which retains more than 1/3 of the platelets in the human body. the igg content in the spleen of itp patients is 5 to 35 times that of the normal control, and the anti-platelet antibody binds to the relevant antigen. increased phagocytosis and destruction by spleen macrophages, and immediate increase in platelet count after splenectomy in most itp patients also indicates that the spleen plays a central role in the pathogenesis of itp, while in some patients, itp still recurs after splenectomy, paigg is obvious increased, it may be related to lymphoid tissue and bone marrow can still produce anti-platelet antibodies, and become the main destruction site of platelets.","['shock', 'tooth bleeding', 'spleen big', 'black stool', 'short platelet life shortening', 'dechaotic spot', 'sinus', 'thrombocytopenia', 'bone marrow megakaryocyte maturation disorder', ' nosebleeds]",['shock'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
iron utilization anemia,"iron-utilized anemia is an anemia that occurs when iron storage in the body does not meet the needs of normal red blood cell production. it is due to insufficient iron intake, decreased absorption, increased demand, and excessive iron utilization or loss.morphological manifestations of small cell hypochromic anemia.iron utilization anemia is not a disease, but a symptom of the disease, and the symptoms are related to the degree of anemia and the onset of onset.","in people prone to such anemia, attention should be paid to health education and preventive measures, such as: 1 improve the baby's breastfeeding method and timely increase the appropriate supplementary food. 2 actively implement family planning to prevent excessive childbirth. 3 oral ferrous sulfate 0.2 or 0.3g per day during the late pregnancy and lactation. 4 conduct large-scale prevention and control of parasitic diseases in areas where hookworm disease is endemic. 5 timely treatment of chronic hemorrhagic foci.","in fast-growing infants, children, menorrhagia, women during pregnancy or lactation, the need for iron increases, and if the diet is absent, it is prone to iron anemia.the occurrence of iron-utilized anemia is gradually formed over a long period of time. during the iron depletion period, the stored iron is depleted and the serum ferritin is reduced. there is no anemia at this time. if the iron deficiency is further aggravated, the stored iron is exhausted. blood loss, especially chronic blood loss, is the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia. the most important causes are gastrointestinal bleeding such as ulcer disease, cancer, hookworm disease, esophageal varices bleeding, hemorrhoids, and gastric antrum after taking salicylate. inflammation and other diseases that can cause chronic bleeding, women with menorrhagia and hemolytic anemia with hemosiderin or hemoglobinuria can cause iron utilization anemia. serum ferritin and serum iron decreased, total iron binding capacity increased, and iron-deficient anemia occurred due to iron absorption disorder, and iron deficiency anemia was rare.","['splenomegaly', 'inattention is not concentrated', 'malnutrition', 'tongue inflammation', 'visual papilledema']",['stomatitis'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
vitamin k deficiency,"vitamin k is an essential fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in the blood coagulation process.vitamin k is high in green leafy vegetables and various edible oils such as soybean, cottonseed, rapeseed and olive oil.vitamin k deficiency can occur at any age, but babies are the most common.","it is recommended to routinely use vitamin k1 0.5~1mg for neonates to prevent hypoprothrombinemia and reduce the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage caused by trauma. it can also be used prophylactically when considering surgery. give the mother a prophylactic dose (2~5mg/d, oral) of vitamin k1 for the first week, or give vitamin k1 solution (2~5mg, intramuscular injection) 6 to 24 hours before delivery. pregnancy with anticonvulsant medication women should take 20 mg of vitamin k1 daily to prevent fetal bleeding 2 weeks before delivery. low levels of green leaf in breast milk are not due to insufficient intake and cannot be stored by fresh green leafy vegetables that are eaten every day.","causes of malabsorption ofdisease (1) bile salt deficiency: such as common bile duct obstruction, biliary fistula, bile salt deficiency caused by postoperative bile drainage, or long-term use of mineral oil lubricants, so that fat-soluble vitamin k absorption disorder. (2) various intestinal lesions: malabsorption syndrome, after gastrointestinal resection and so on. (3) long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to inhibit intestinal bacterial growth and reduce intestinal vitamin k2 synthesis. use of severe liver function damage, oral anticoagulants such as warfarin (warfarin), acenocoumarin (acenocumarol) and dicoumarin (dicoumarol) and other chemical structures and vitamin k analogues, can inhibit vitamins k participates in the synthesis and activation of coagulation factors. vitamin k deficiency or oral administration of the above anticoagulants can cause the formation of protein induced by vitamine k deficiency ii (pivka-ii), pivka-ii glutamate residue. the base is not r-carboxylated, can not bind to ca2, can not adhere to phospholipids, can not activate, has no coagulation function. active transfer and absorption of vitamin k2 in the terminal ileum and colon passive diffusion absorption, both need bile, pancreatic juice to participate, and combined with chylomicrons, transported by the lymphatic system to the whole body, stored in the liver, adrenal gland, lung, bone marrow, kidney and other organs, storage not much, excreted from the urine in the form of glucuronic acid derivatives, affecting intestinal absorption factors, liquid paraffin, other lipid solvents, laxatives can significantly reduce the absorption of vitamin k, long-term diarrhea fat absorption disorders, or patients with bile duct obstruction often cause vitamin k deficiency; long-term antibiotic treatment can inhibit the synthesis of vitamin k in the intestine, which can also cause vitamin k deficiency, and the activity of vitamin k complex is easily destroyed by ultraviolet rays and alkali. vitamin k is an important coenzyme for vitamin k-dependent coagulation factors (ii, vii, ix, x), 污-carboxylation of plasma coagulation inhibitor (protein c, protein s) glutamate residue, and when vitamin k is deficient, the above-mentioned coagulation factor the synthesis, activation is significantly inhibited, causing various bleeding manifestations, vitamin k-assisted glutamate residue 污-carboxylation also occurs in bone, tooth, kidney, skin, liver and breast tissue protein molecules, in the bone it is to regulate osteocalcin-osteocalcin (osteo-calcin) deposited in bone matrix, and may be involved in renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. in 1989, the american academy of sciences recommended daily dietary supply of vitamin k, normal adult male daily. 70 to 80 米g, 60 to 65 米g per day for adult women, and the amount of vitamin k required for humans is 0.5 to 1.0 米g/kg per day.","['vitamin k deficiency', 'intracranial hemorrhage', 'bleeding tendency', 'gingle bleeding', 'gastrointestinal bleeding', 'meningeal irritation', 'fat soluble vitamin deficiency', 'increased intracranial pressure', ' angle bow reversal', 'nose bleeding']",['intracranial hemorrhage'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

and nephritis are the main clinical manifestations.","if there is no nephritis, the prognosis is good, but the disease course is as long as 1 month to several months. it is easy to relapse. the interval between recurrences varies from several weeks to several months. if the intestinal bleeding is heavier, it is easy to control and the intracranial it is rare to see that the prognosis of this disease is mainly related to the nature of kidney disease. some cases can be prolonged for several years, but most patients with mild kidney damage can gradually recover. a few severe cases can be associated with hypertensive encephalopathy and chronic renal failure. most of them occurred several years after the onset of nephritis. it has been reported that kidney disease or recurrent episodes in the first three months of the disease accompanied by nephropathy often have a poor prognosis. prevention of allergic purpura in children 1.takecare to avoid contact with pathogens such as pollen, chemicals, paint, gasoline, dust mites, etc. 2, children with allergies do not need to raise pets, try to reduce contact with animal skin, especially those who have already identified allergens should pay more attention. 3, pay attention to food hygiene, wash hands frequently, do not eat unclean fruits and aquatic plants, in order to eliminate the chance of intestinal parasite infection. 4, strengthen exercise, enhance physical fitness, improve the body's immunity to various infections, to avoid the cause of allergic purpura. 5, pay attention to climate change, timely increase or decrease clothes, prevent colds, regular ventilation in the room to keep the indoor air fresh. 6, before the condition has not healed, do not vaccinate various preventive vaccines, must be cured after 3 to 6 months, in order to prevent vaccination, otherwise it may lead to the recurrence of the disease.","the most common bacterial infection is 汕-hemolytic streptococcus, followed by staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, salmonella typhi, pneumococcal and pseudomonas. the above respiratory tract inflammation is more common, also seen in pneumonia, tonsillitis , scarlet fever, bacillary dysentery, urinary tract infection, impetigo, tuberculosis and focal infections (skin, teeth, mouth, middle ear). there are rubella, flu, measles, chickenpox, mumps, hepatitis, etc. in the virus infection. parasitic infections can also cause the disease, which is more common with aphid infections, as well as hookworms, whipworms, aphids, schistosomiasis, vaginal trichomoniasis, and malaria parasite infections. allergic purpura is an autoimmune disease. the permeability and brittleness of capillaries are caused by the body's allergic reaction to certain allergens, resulting in hemorrhage and edema of subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and internal organs. allergens can be caused by a variety of factors, but it is often difficult to find the exact cause of each specific case. it is generally believed that it may be related to a variety of predisposing factors, but direct pathogenic factors are often difficult to affirm. insect bites, plant pollen, cold, trauma, menopause, tuberculin test, vaccination, and mental factors can all be caused. in addition, hemodialysis patients, lymphoma chemotherapy patients and guillain-barre syndrome patients have also reported allergic

thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,"thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is also called thrombotic microangiopathy hemolytic anemia, platelet thrombosis syndrome and the like.an uncommon thrombotic microangiopathy with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, clinical features of fever, thrombocytopenic purpura, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, multiple neurological and renal damage, etc., the cause of which is unknown it may be related to vascular factors, infections, and drug allergies. most patients are between the ages of 10 and 40, and about 60% are women.the onset is rapid and the condition is serious. two-thirds of the cases die within 3 months, and a few cases are slow. the course of disease can last from several months to several years.","it is necessary to pay attention to the spirit of happiness, living and festivals, pay attention to cold and warm, eat less fat and nourishment products, mild disease, if the bleeding symptoms are light, can be appropriate activities, is conducive to the operation of blood, serious patients should rest properly, or in bed treatment. the prevention of this disease is fundamentally to prevent the formation or production of blood stasis. therefore, the main measures are to strengthen the body's righteousness, prevent emotional internal injuries, eating disorders and foreign evils, and timely and correctly treat various diseases so as to avoid human diseases. and cause this disease.","in the capillaries with obvious lesions, the pathological changes of the endothelium before thrombosis can be seen under electron microscope. microscopic disease can cause erythrocyte lysis due to lesions in the microcirculation, which can aggravate local thrombosis. , can lead to thrombocytopenia, the literature reports that ttp can be associated with discoid or systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, multiple nodular arteritis, etc., these diseases have a certain degree of characteristics vasculitis lesions. it has been found that the lack of a plasminogen activin in the vascular endothelial cell layer of patients with ttp causes local fibrinolytic function to impede thrombosis in small blood vessels. studies have confirmed that local platelet activation may play a role in the pathogenesis of ttp. role, some patients with advanced tfp plasma can cause normal human platelet aggregation, but after mixing with normal plasma at 37 ～ c, the platelet aggregation activity can be gradually reduced, it is considered that there may be some platelet activating factor (paf) in the patient's plasma. ), it may also lack the inhibition of platelet activating factor (pafi) and cause disease. it is reported that the obvious aggregation of platelets requires the binding of high molecular vwf polymer to gpib in the surface structure of platelets, followed by plasma proteins (probably fibrinogen, thrombus) the regulatory protein or fibronectin) binds to the gpiib-iiia complex. it is currently believed that vascular endothelial cell injury is one of the pathogenic factors of ttp. thrombomodulin (tm) is a high-affinity thrombin receptor in the trophoblast and platelet of vascular endothelial cells. in 1991, takahashi et al. in 13 patients with acute ttp, the results showed that 8 patients had elevated tm concentrations; tm patients with sle were higher than those without sle, tm concentrations were associated with tissue plasminogen activin (t-pa) and vwf: ag. significantly related, but regardless of the number of platelets, there was no significant difference in tm concentration in patients with acute ttp regardless of whether the condition was relieved. the main pathological change of this disease is thrombosis in the microcirculation. some people think that the essence of this disease is dic. takahashi et al tested plasma thrombin-antithrombin iii complex (tat) and plasmin in 10 patients with acute ttp. -汐2-antiplasmin complex (pap), the patient's tat and pap values were higher than the normal control, but there was no correlation between the two, and the pap and tat values of the 5 patients were significantly decreased after remission. however, other abnormal blood coagulation indicators were not abnormal. the authors believe that ttp patients do have increased thrombin and plasmin production, and most patients have no consumptive coagulation. 3. prostaglandin (pgi2) synthesis is reduced or there is a lack of plasma. some factors that prevent pgi2 degradation, about 60% of patients with ttp can be relieved with whole blood or plasma. if treated with 5% albumin, the condition deteriorates. after study, the patient's pgi2 production is normal, but its degradation rate is accelerated, suggesting normal plasma. there is a factor that prevents the rapid degradation of pgi2. it does not exist in albumin. the half-life of this factor is 2 weeks, which can prolong the biological activity of pgi2. its deficiency can lead to a decrease in pgi2, accompanied by microvascular thrombosis, hensby et al.

thrombocytopenia,"thrombocytopenia is a condition caused by a lower than normal platelet count. thrombocytopenia may be caused by insufficient platelet production, spleen retention of platelets, increased platelet destruction or utilization, and dilution, which is severe for whatever reason. thrombocytopenia can cause typical bleeding: multiple ecchymoses, most common in the lower leg; or small scattered ecchymoses in areas with minor trauma; mucosal bleeding, nosebleeds, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract and vagina bleeding, and massive bleeding after surgery, massive bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and bleeding in the central nervous system can be life-threatening.","1, diet prevention: for the prevention of thrombocytopenia, but also pay attention to the patient should not eat greasy, hard food, shrimp, crab and jellyfish hair is also not suitable for food, especially the yin deficiency heat must also be taboo thorny, fried stir-fried barbecue.it is advisable to eat light, low-fat, high-protein foods.the most important thing about thrombocytopenia is iron supplementation. eat more blood tofu, leeks and other foods and vegetables with high iron content. the rest should be recommended to see a doctor according to your own conditions and conditions. 2, enhance physical fitness should strengthen the living adjustment, get up early and get up early, enhance physical fitness.","causes of thrombocytopenia or ineffective death: including hereditary and acquired, reduced acquired platelet production is due to certain factors such as drugs, malignant tumors, infection, ionizing radiation and other damage to hematopoietic stem cells or affect their proliferation in the bone marrow as a result, these factors can affect multiple hematopoietic cell systems, often accompanied by varying degrees of anemia, leukopenia, and marked reduction in bone marrow megakaryocytes. excessive platelet destruction: including congenital and acquired, excessive acquired platelet destruction including immune and non-immune, excessive immune platelet destruction, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and drug thrombocytopenia, non- excessive destruction of immune thrombocytopenia includes infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the like. platelets are excessively retained in the spleen: most common in hypersplenism.","['bleeding tendency', 'hiv infection', 'liver palm', 'sinus', 'nitrogenemia', 'nausea', 'nose bleeding']",['digestive tract bleeding'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hemophilia,"hemophilia is a group of hemorrhagic diseases with hereditary coagulopathy. its common feature is the active thromboplastin-producing disorder, prolonged clotting time, and a tendency to post-traumatic hemorrhage in life. severe cases can also occur spontaneously without obvious trauma. sexual bleeding.hemorrhagic sites are more common in joints and can be divided into hemophilia a, b, and c. among them, hemophilia a and b are x-recessive hereditary diseases, and hemophilia c is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease. the main causes of the disease are genetic factors and gene mutations, and treatment is mainly based on on-demand treatment and preventive treatment.","first, avoid intravenous and intramuscular injections of patients. second, because the disease is a hereditary disease, it is necessary for the patient and his family to understand the principle of prenatal and postnatal care. if the prenatal amniocentesis is diagnosed as hemophilia, the pregnancy should be terminated to reduce the birth rate of hemophilia. third, flirting: due to mental stimulation can induce bleeding. 4. once the bleeding is caused by trauma or other reasons, it should be disposed of in time. the complications and sequelae caused by this are relatively light. 5. if surgery is required, the viii factor must be referred to the alternative treatment effect according to the plasma viii:c level and the size of the operation before surgery. 6. drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation, such as aspirin, phenylbutazone, dipyridamole and prostaglandin e.","congenital coagulation factor deficiency, resulting in hemorrhagic disease, congenital factor viii deficiency is a typical sexual recessive inheritance, transmitted by women, male onset, control factor viii coagulation component synthesis of genes located on the x chromosome, diseased men and normal women marriage, the males are normal in the children, the females are the transmitters, the normal males and the females in the delivery are married, and half of the males are the patients. the genetic pattern of factor ix deficiency is the same as that of hemophilia a. however, in female transmitters, the level of factor ix is low, there is a tendency to hemorrhage, and the lack of factor x1 causes a disorder in the formation of blood thromboplastin. prothrombin cannot be converted into blood coagulation. enzymes, fibrinogen can not be converted to fibrin and are prone to bleeding.","['repeated bleeding', 'bleeding tendency', 'bone destruction', 'blood urine', 'abnormal uterine bleeding', 'black stool', 'abdominal pain', 'blowing nose', 'muscle atrophy']",['muscle atrophy'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['supportive treatment', 'alternative treatment']"
neonatal sepsis,"septicemia of newborn refers to the pathogenesis of neonatal pathogens invading the neonatal blood circulation through various ways, and growing and breeding, producing toxins and causing systemic infection.the incidence and mortality of the disease are high in the neonatal period. with the deepening of the study of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, the definition of sepsis is also expanding, including the initiation of endogenous infectious agents (such as intestinal flora). systemic inflammation and infection, neonatal sepsis generally refers to the presence of bacteria in the blood and continuous reproduction, a pathological process that can obtain positive bacterial results through blood culture, with evidence of bacterial-immunological diagnosis, and diagnosis can also be made without obtaining positive blood culture results. it is still a very important disease in the neonatal period, and its incidence rate is about 1R10R of live births, and the incidence rate is higher in premature infants.","1. do a good job in perinatal care: regular prenatal examinations for pregnant women should be strictly performed during the delivery process. premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine asphyxia or long-term labor should be treated prophylactically. mothers with infection and fever apply a broad spectrum of antibiotics through the placental barrier to minimize the chance of cross-infection in the recovery of asphyxiated neonates. 2. strengthen monitoring of high-risk children: high-risk newborns who may have sepsis should be closely monitored, pay attention to the neonatal complexion, breast milk, mental status and body temperature changes. 3. do a good job of skin and mucous membrane care: pay special attention to keep the mouth, skin, mucous membrane and umbilical area clean, avoid infection or injury, do not pick ""horse teeth"", cut ""oral fat pad"", do not use rough and dirty cloth towel scrub the newborn's mouth to avoid damage to the oral mucosa. if there is an infectious lesion, it should be treated promptly, and appropriate antibiotics should be used to prevent infection.","(1) pathogens the pathogens in different regions of the pathogens are different. in europe and the united states, group a hemolytic streptococcus dominated in the 1940s, staphylococcus aureus dominated in the 1950s, escherichia coli dominated in the 1960s, and group b after the 1970s. hemolytic streptococcus (gbs) is the most common bacterium, followed by e. coli, klebsiella, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella. in recent years, staphylococcus epidermidis has become the most common bacterium in the united states. china is still the most common escherichia coli (more k1 antigen) and staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella, pseudomonas aeruginosa and l bacteria (named after the lister institute) infection has been reported, staphylococcus epidermidis infection continues to increase, gbs although there are reports, not many. infection pathway neonatal sepsis can occur before birth, at birth and after birth, the intrauterine infection is mainly transmitted through the placenta; during the delivery process caused by bacterial infection of the birth canal; postnatal infection is the most common, bacteria can invade the skin, mucous membranes, such as digestion road, respiratory tract, urinary tract, umbilicus is the most vulnerable part of the infection, neonatal birth with respiratory depression and resuscitation intervention, amniocentesis time is too long (> 24h), the mother has infection or fever. the non-specific and specific immune functions of theself-factors areimperfect, igm, iga deficiency, poor ability to limit the lesions, bacteria into the body can easily spread the infection and cause sepsis, male infants and low body weight are relatively easy to get infected, with birth the decrease in body weight and the increase in morbidity and mortality. (two) pathogenesis the main mechanism of inflammatory reaction caused by neonatal sepsis is the result of two factors. one is due to the direct effect of bacterial toxin on various systems of the body, especially the affected organs, mainly the damage of toxins to related organs and cells. on the other hand, inflammatory reactions and multiple organ dysfunction are caused by various proinflammatory factors and cytokines; including tumor necrosis factor (tnf), procalcitin, activated complement, and platelet activating factor (paf) and a variety of interleukins (il-1, 6, 8 etc.), in mature neonates, especially in severely infected neonates, inflammatory mediators and cytokines have become the main causative mechanism of sirs and mods. on the other hand, the inflammatory response of premature infants, low birth weight infants and immature infants is not perfect, especially immune cell dysfunction associated with inflammatory reactions, including neutrophil chemotaxis, required during agglomeration some adhesion factors such as selectin dysfunction can also be an important factor in infection spread and poor prognosis.","['bacterial infection', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'sanfeng fever type', 'heart rate increase', 'diarrhea', 'signs of sepsis', 'spotted spot', 'sepsis', 'irritability', ' moan']",['osteomyelitis'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric synthesis']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
neonatal hemolytic disease,"hemolytic disease (newborn), also known as fetal erythroblastosis, belongs to the same family of immuno-hemolytic anemia (iso-immunehemolyticanemia), which refers to immune hemolytic anemia caused by blood group antibodies.it is caused by the incompatibility of maternal and child blood types, and it is one of the most common causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and it has an early onset and rapid progress. in severe cases, it can cause jaundice, so it is a disease worthy of attention. .the incidence rate of the first child accounts for 40% to 50%.","1. the fetal period can be diagnosed in the fetal period. (1) early delivery: rh-negative pregnant women have a stillbirth, a history of miscarriage, can take the mother's blood for immunological examination, such as detecting positive antibody, pregnant women should be followed up monthly to check the change in antibody titer, rh antibody effect in this pregnancy the price rises from low to 1:32 or 1:64, the amniotic fluid bilirubin value is increased, and the amniotic phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin ratio is >2 (indicating that the fetal lung is mature), and early delivery can be considered to alleviate fetal involvement. (2) repeated plasma exchange: for patients with severe rh hemolytic disease prenatal monitoring blood rh antibody titration is increasing, can be given repeated plasma exchange treatment, in exchange for antibodies, reduce fetal hemolysis. (3) intrauterine blood transfusion: fetal edema, or fetal hb <80g / l and the lung is not mature, feasible intrauterine blood transfusion, directly with the pregnant women serum non-aggregated concentrated red blood cells under the b-ultrasound into the umbilical blood vessels. (4) drugs: from the 4th month of pregnancy, oral chinese herbal medicine motherwort, angelica, white peony, guangmuxiang, one dose per day, until delivery, pregnant women with abo blood group incompatibility can give prevention of traditional chinese medicine such as yinchen, pregnant women were given phenobarbital 90 mg/d 1 to 2 weeks before the expected date of birth to induce fetal glucuronyltransferase production. (5) termination of pregnancy: comprehensive treatment should be given to pregnant women to reduce the antibody producer and terminate the pregnancy if necessary. 2. after birth: rh-negative women should be intramuscularly injected with anti-rhd igg 300米g as soon as possible within 72h of delivery of rh-positive infants to avoid sensitization; 300米g intramuscular injection at 29 weeks of the next pregnancy, the effect is better. for rh-negative women with abortion, prenatal bleeding, amniocentesis or ectopic pregnancy when rh-positive blood is transfused, the same dose should be administered intramuscularly.","the incidence of neonatal hemolysis caused by rh blood group incompatibility is low in china. usually, the mother is rh-negative, the fetus is rh-positive and the blood type is inconsistent, and causes hemolysis. generally, the first fetus does not occur, but the disease from the second fetus however, if a rh-negative mother received a rh-positive blood transfusion before the first fetus, the first fetus may also develop. the disease is most common with abo blood group incompatibility, the most common is that the mother is o type, the fetus (or baby) is type a or type b, the first child can be ill, the more the number of births, the higher the incidence rate, and once more serious than once, it can be seen that the mother is type a, the fetus (or baby) is type b or type ab, the mother is type b, and the fetus (or baby) is type b or type ab, but rare, fetus (or baby) for type o, the disease can be ruled out. the hereditary dominant antigen is just missing from the mother. the fetal blood enters the mother for some reason. the mother produces the corresponding igm antibody. when the fetal blood enters the mother again, the mother has a secondary immune reaction, which produces a large amount of igg antibodies and enters through the placenta. fetus, so that the fetus, neonatal hemolysis, as long as 0.1 ~ 0.2ml of fetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation is enough to make the mother sensitized. 1.rh blood group incompatibility: most mothers are rh negative, but rh-positive mothers can also have morbidity. the incidence of first child is very low, because it takes 2-6 months for the first immune response to produce igm antibodies. weak, can not enter the fetus through the placenta, and the majority of fetal red blood cells into the mother occurs in the end of pregnancy or at the time of labor, so the first child is often in the latent stage of the primary immune response, when the second immune response occurs in the second pregnancy, only need to count it can appear in the day, mainly the antibody that igg can pass through the placenta, and it can increase rapidly. therefore, the second child is often ill. the antibody of rh system can only be caused by human red blood cells. if the mother has had a history of blood transfusion, and the rh blood type is different. the first child can also be ill, the mother's mother (grandmother) is rh-positive, the mother has been sensitized before birth, the first child can also be ill, this is the grandmother's theory. 2. abo blood group is not hemolytic disease: most of them are mother o type, fetal type a or type b; a few are mother type a, fetal type b or type ab, or mother type b, fetal type a or type ab, because a or natural anti-a or anti-b antibodies of type b mothers are mainly igm antibodies that cannot pass through the placenta, while alloantibodies present in type o mothers are mainly igg, so abo hemolytic disease is mainly found in o-type mothers, a or b. type of fetus, bo hemolytic disease can occur in the first child, because food, gram-negative bacteria, intestinal parasites, vaccines, etc. also have a or b blood type substances, continuous immune stimulation can make the body produce igg anti-a or anti-b antibody, such antibodies can cause hemolysis after entering the fetus through the placenta after pregnancy. since a and b antigens are also present in many tissues outside the red blood cells, only a small amount of anti-a or anti-b antibodies through the placenta are combined with red blood cells, and the rest are it is neutralized and absorbed by soluble a and b blood group substances in other tissues and plasma, so although the maternal and infant abo blood group incompatibility is very common, the incidence is only a minority.","['mother and child abo blood type incompatibility', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'fetal edema', 'physiologic jaundice', 'twitching', 'corner arch reversal', 'hypoproteinemia']",['hemolysis anemia'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric synthesis']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

the finger pressure hemostasis method is used to press the end of the hemorrhage artery close to the heart with a finger, palm or fist, which can cut off the blood flow and achieve the purpose of temporarily stopping bleeding. if you can't reach complete hemostasis in a short time, you should go to the hospital urgently for treatment. 5. patients should always have ice packs in their homes: patients with blood diseases have low body resistance and often have a fever. when you have a fever, your family should use the physical cooling method. you can put ice packs under the head and under the arm to achieve the purpose of cooling. you can also use cold water or alcohol to clean the bath to avoid cooling. 6. prevent cross-infection at home: cross-infection is a common cause of secondary infection of blood diseases. when relatives and friends suffer from respiratory infections or other infectious diseases, avoid contact with patients and keep the indoor environment clean.","the factor viii in normal human plasma is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of up to 1 million to 2 million, containing low molecular weight and high molecular weight components, low molecular weight with coagulation activity (viii: c), and high molecular weight component with factor viii. related antigen (viiir: ag) and vw factor (viiir: vwf), the synthetic sites of these three components, the genetic loci and their genetic patterns are controlled differently, and viii:c is synthesized by liver spleen or monocyte. under the control of x chromosome, viii:c activity is reduced in hemophilia a, and it is recessive in sex chromosome. viiir:ag and viiir:vwf are synthesized by endothelial cells, megakaryocytes and platelets, by autosomal inheritance, normal plasma. the vwf value is 10 mg/l, and its activity is produced by a series of plasma multimers. the molecular weight of the polymer is about 400,000 to 20 million. it exists in plasma, platelets and under the vascular endothelium, and the plasma vwf concentration is slightly decreased or high. loss of molecular weight multimer selectivity can reduce platelet adhesion function, lack of these two components in vwd patients, or the molecular structure abnormalities of these two components, various physiological activities of viii factor polymeroften, the viii:c function also has a corresponding effect. viiir:ag contains low, medium and high molecular weight polymers, which constitute different subtypes of vwd. the high molecular weight polymer of viiir:ag binds to specific receptors of platelets. platelets can be adhered to the subendothelial layer. according to the biochemical characteristics and function of factor viiir:ag, vwd is divided into several types. type i is more common, which shows the lack of factor viiir:ag, the content of various polymers decreases, and all activities of factor viii decrease, but the structure is normal. type i is divided into autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance. the former is rare and the clinical manifestation is extremely serious. the plasma viiir:ag disappears or is less than 0.1%, and can not be increased by injection of ddavp. type ii: the amount of viiir:ag is normal, but the structure of factor viiir:ag polymer is abnormal, the amount of viii:c is normal or slightly lower, and it is autosomal dominant. these patients lack high molecular weight and medium molecular weight polymers, type ii. it is divided into several subtypes.","['trauma', 'bleeding tendency', 'intracranial hemorrhage', 'tooth bleeding', 'postpartum hemorrhage', 'sinus', 'gastrointestinal bleeding']",['hemacelinosis'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

nutritional giant erythrocyte anemia,"nutritional megaloblastic anemia (nutritional megaloblastic anemia), also known as vegetative large cell anemia, is more common in infants and young children, especially within 2 years of age. it is more common in rural areas of north china, northeast china and northwest china, and has been significantly reduced in recent years.mainly due to lack of vitamin b12 or folic acid.its characteristics are: red blood cells are more normal than normal, red blood cells are more obvious than hemoglobin reduction, granulocytes and thrombocytopenia, granulocyte nuclei shift right, bone marrow appears giant red blood cells and other hematopoietic characteristics, and it is effective by vitamin b12 and folic acid treatment.","prevention of this disease should start from improving the dietary structure of the population and changing living habits. for susceptible individuals, the awareness of drug prevention should be improved. the recommended daily folic acid requirement by who is: 40-50 米g for infants in the month of june, 120 米g for 7-12 months, 1~ 12米g 200米g, 13米+ 400米g, pregnant women 800米g, lactation 600米g, for vegetable intake, processing methods should be publicized and guided, vegetarian diet should have vitamin content, for the higher incidence of rural areas should be changed propaganda and education of their living habits.","vitamin b12 is mainly found in animal foods, with more liver, kidney and meat, and less milk. folic acid is rich in fresh green leafy vegetables, liver and kidney. the main requirement for vitamin b12 is ~3g per day for adults and ~1g per day for infants. the physiological requirement of folic acid is F75g per day for adults. infants are ~20g daily. if you do not add food supplements in time, or long-term partial eclipse in older children, it is prone to vitamin b12 or folic acid deficiency. in the small bowel resection of chronic diarrhea, localized ileitis, intestinal tuberculosis, etc. can affect the absorption of vitamin b12 and folic acid, liver disease, acute infection, gastric acid reduction or vitamin c deficiency, can affect the metabolism or utilization of vitamin b12 and folic acid. immature children, rapid growth during neonatal and infancy. the amount of hematopoietic material needs to increase relatively, such as insufficient intake, it is easy to lack. when the infection is repeated, the consumption of vitamin b12 folate is increased, so that the amount of demand is increased and it is easy to cause deficiency. the fetus can pass through the placenta and obtain vitamin b12 folic acid stored in the liver. if the pregnant woman suffers from vitamin b12 or folic acid deficiency, the newborn is stored less and is prone to deficiency. pathogenesis folic acid and vitamin b12 are essential for dna synthesis in the nucleus. the key to cell proliferation and cleavage is dna replication and doubling. dna is composed of two polynucleotide chains. the basic unit is composed of 4 different bases. a polymer consisting of a single nucleotide, the four bases being adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine. folic acid becomes active tfa in the liver through the action of dihydrofolate reductase. tfa is a coenzyme that transfers a carbon group in the body. these groups are derived from the catabolism of some amino acids and compounds such as formic acid, which can be attached to the molecule of thfa. it can be transferred to other intermediate metabolites and participate in the synthesis of important compounds such as nucleic acids, such as the synthesis of purines, the biosynthesis of pyrimidines, the conversion of amino acids, and the formation and utilization of formate. vitamin b12 is mainly involved in four important metabolic reactions in the human body: 1. the inactive methylthfa is converted to active thfa, which improves the utilization of folic acid. 2 promote folic acid into the cell. 3 involved in the production of deoxythymidine nucleotides, it can be seen from the above, vitamin b12 deficiency is caused by folic acid metabolism disorders, causing dna synthesis disorders, so it causes clinical manifestations and morphological changes of anemia, difficult to distinguish from anemia caused by folic acid deficiency, this explains why vitamin b12 can improve the anemia of folate deficiency, and a large amount of folic acid can change the hematological changes of vitamin b12 deficiency. 4 vitamin b12 can promote the metabolism of fat metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is related to the formation of lipoproteins in the myelin sheath, thus maintaining the complete function of the central and peripheral myelinated nerve fibers. when vitamin b12 is deficient, nerve fiber lesions, and thus neuropsychiatric symptoms, because folic acid does not participate in this metabolism, can not change the nervous system damage caused by vitamin b12 deficiency, folic acid increases the utilization of vitamin b12 by hematopoietic cells, it can aggravate the symptoms of the nervous system.","['lymph node enlargement', 'tremor', 'tiredness', 'diarrhea', 'nutrition', 'twitching',

primary thrombocytopenic purpura,"primary thrombocytopenic purpura refers to thrombocytopenia caused by no obvious exogenous causes, but most of them are due to increased platelet destruction caused by immune response, so it is also known as autoimmune thrombocytopenia, which is a common type of hemorrhagic disease. hematological diseases are characterized by shortened platelet life and increased megakaryocytes in bone marrow. in 80%-90% of cases, there are igg antibodies on the surface of serum or platelets, and the spleen has no obvious swelling. according to the pathogenesis, predisposing factors and course of disease, itp is divided into acute and chronic types.80% of children are acute (aitp), no gender difference, easy to develop in spring and winter. once the source is cleared, the disease will heal in june-december, and the adult itp is more than 95% chronic (citp). the ratio of male to female is about 1 : 3, generally considered to be a kind of autoimmune disease, prolonged and difficult to heal.the mortality rate of this disease is about 1%, most of them are due to intracranial hemorrhage. the main clinical manifestations of itp are skin mucosal hemorrhage or visceral hemorrhage.","1. actively participate in sports activities to enhance physical fitness and improve disease resistance. 2. pay attention to prevent respiratory infections, measles, chickenpox, rubella and hepatitis, otherwise it is easy to induce or aggravate the condition. 3. in the acute phase or when there is a lot of bleeding, rest in bed, limit the activities of children, and eliminate their fear and nervousness. 4. avoid traumatic collisions, so as not to cause bleeding. 5. when the platelet count is lower than 20G109/l, it is necessary to closely observe the changes in the condition and prevent various trauma and intracranial hemorrhage. 6. diet should be light, rich in nutrition, easy to digest, hematemesis, blood in the stool should be in a semi-flow diet, avoid hard food and crude fiber food, avoid spicy food, children can eat more peanuts, red dates and other foods .","1. acute type itp occurs in the recovery period of viral infection or upper respiratory tract infection, such as rubella, measles, chickenpox, salivary gland cancer, etc., patients have higher antiviral antibodies in serum, and platelet surface related antibodies are significantly increased, so it is considered to be the pathogenesis of viral antigens may be that antigen-antibody complexes including viral antigens and platelet fc receptors or autoantibodies produced by viral antigens cross-react with platelet membranes, damage platelets, and are cleared by phagocytic cells. 2. there is no history of prodromal infection before the onset of chronic itp. it is caused by autoantibodies caused by changes in platelet structure antigens. 80% to 90% of the patients have platelet surface-related antibodies, 95% of which are palgg, 2/3 of palgg and palgm. a few effects are palga and pac. the antibody acts directly on the glycoprotein on the platelet membrane. a small number of effects and gbib complex cause shortening of platelet life and functional changes. the content of the platelet is negatively correlated with platelet life. it has been confirmed that the spleen is a platelet antibody production. the main place.","['splenomegaly', 'blood stasis', 'shortened platelet life', 'thrombocytopenia', 'fear cold']",['coma'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
essential thrombocytopenia,"primary thrombocytosis (primary throbocythemia) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by hemorrhagic tendency and thrombosis. it means that the number of platelets in the peripheral blood exceeds the upper limit of normal platelet count by 400G109/l, and the function is not normal. the cells proliferate excessively.because this disease often has repeated bleeding, it is also called hemorrhagic thrombocytosis, the incidence is not high, more common in those over 40 years old, the main pathophysiological characteristics are: clonality, reactive or secondary, familial or hereditary sex, treatment remains to be resolved.","patients need to visit frequently, monitor peripheral blood changes, adjust medications in time, understand the evolution of the disease, pay attention to self-protection, prevent traumatic bleeding, and take small doses of enteric-coated aspirin to reduce platelet and platelet aggregation.","(a) the cause of the disease thrombocytopenia is a disease caused by the clonal proliferation of a single abnormal pluripotent stem cell, the number of pathogenic megakaryocytes, the average megakaryocyte capacity increased, platelet growth or up to 15 times the normal rate . the disease of stem cells confirmed by g6pd isoenzyme test that the disease is also a clonal disease of pluripotent stem cells, resulting in sustained proliferation of bone marrow megakaryocytes, increased platelet production, and release of platelets stored in the spleen and liver, but platelet life is mostly normal. platelet function defect adhesion and aggregation function decreased, platelet third factor decreased, serotonin decreased and release function abnormality, some patients still have abnormal blood coagulation mechanism, capillary fragility increased, platelet hyperplasia, activated platelet production of thromboxane it is easy to cause platelet aggregation and release reaction, which can form thrombus in microvessels, and extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and other organs in the late stage. (ii) pathogenesis the nature of cloning was established because an isoenzyme of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) was found in the red blood cell line of a female case of this disease, which was expressed as g-6-pd. the heterozygote of two types of ""a"" and ""b"" was found in the erythroid and granulocyte progenitor cells of another patient. the main phenotype of this disease is expressed in the megakaryocyte-platelet system. it is related to the dominant cloning of megakaryocyte-platelet regulators by abnormal cloning. it is also possible that mutations occur in pluripotent stem cells with differentiation mainly toward megakaryocyte-platelet cells. histological examination and in vitro culture of megakaryocytes indicate that megakaryocytes in the bone marrow of this disease abnormal expansion of progenitor cells, megakaryocyte colony forming units (cfu-meg) in patients with bone marrow and blood increased significantly compared with normal or secondary thrombocytopenia, may be associated with cfu-meg clone size abnormalities and nuclear intranuclear replication, cfu-meg growth is also common in the absence of exogenous growth factors, and in a few cases there is an increase in granulocyte-monocyte colony forming units and erythrocyte colony forming units. when the number of megakaryocytes, the average megakaryocyte capacity increased, platelet production reached 15 times the normal rate, platelet life is usually normal, a small number of cases may be caused by spleen destruction of platelets, a large number of platelets increase the mechanism of bleeding and thrombosis certainly, it is generally believed that abnormal platelet function is the main cause of bleeding. some patients may be one of the causes of decreased clotting factors. the significant increase in the number of platelets leads to high-aggregative thrombosis. the intrinsic defects of platelets are characterized by a decrease in serotonin in platelets. decreased adhesion function, decreased adp and adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation, etc., the megakaryocyte proliferation of this disease is not only in the bone marrow, but also may involve extramedullary tissue, liver, spleen and other tissues may appear megakaryocyte-based hyperplasia, due to the low degree of malignancy, the growth rate is slow, the liver and spleen are often moderately enlarged, and no external pathogenic factors related to the disease have been found so far.","['insomnia', 'spleen embolism', 'venous thrombosis', 'weakness', 'sensory disorder']",['thrombus formation'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

histiocytosis,"histiocytosis (reticulocyte proliferation or reticuloendotheliosis) refers to a group of diseases in which histiocytic or pseudotumoral hyperplasia of histiocytes can not be classified as malignant lymphoma, generally including bone eosinophilic granuloma, xanthomatosis and infant malignant reticulocyte proliferation.the three should be considered as a chronic and acute process of the same lesion, with transitional and intermediate types in between.due to different stages of development, the lesion may be single or multiple, and may be located within or outside the bone.tissue cell proliferative disorders, including all variants thereof, are a systemic disorder.these kinds of performances are not so much a disease, but rather a syndrome. although they are different from each other, the boundaries are not very clear. many authors at home and abroad have reported that eosinophilic granuloma has turned into a yellow tumor. histiocytosis can be divided into single and multiple.the former is bone eosinophilic granuloma, and the latter is divided into a chronic type (with or without yellow lipoma), and an acute type (children with malignant reticulocyte proliferation) with an intermediate type (transition type).some authors divide tissue proliferative disorders into localized and diffuse types, the former occurring mostly in older children and adults, the latter being more common in infants.eosinophilic granuloma is more common in male patients. the common age of onset is 1 to 15 years old, especially between 5 and 10 years old.however, it can also occur in adulthood. eosinophilic granuloma usually occurs in the ribs and mandibles in those over 20 years old, and occurs in the skull at the age of 20 years.occurring in the spine is rare.",there are no special preventive measures for this disease. early detection and early treatment are the key to prevent this disease.,"the main pathological changes of the eosinophilic granuloma of the vertebrae are the proliferation of extensive reticular tissue cells, with varying eosinophils, various inflammatory cells, and multinucleated giant cells, some of which can be transformed into foam cells. and hemocytic cells containing hemosiderin or cell residual, small blood vessels may have cellulose-like necrosis, advanced fibrosis, tissue nuclei large, oval, gear-shaped or kidney-shaped, often aggregated into a pile or strip. the main lesion of xanthomatosis is histiocytosis, which can be seen in reticulocytes, foam cells and touton-type giant cells. foam cells are also called yellow cells, have acicular cholesterol crystals, eosinophils are not obvious, and some parts have granulation tissue. poor differentiation, there may be a small number of nuclear division, tissue cells are replaced by fibroblasts, forming connective tissue, some between foam cells, instead of granulation tissue. in the same patient, the same lesion at different times, the pathology can be different, such as the beginning of the eosinophilic tissue cell granuloma, but after a few years can be transformed into a foam cell-based lipid granuloma therefore, it is not possible to confirm the diagnosis of xanthomatosis based solely on the presence or absence of foam cells. even in infant reticulocyte proliferation, foam cells can be seen occasionally, but it is rare because the lesions develop less than soon. the lung begins to be interstitial granuloma, and then the tissue cells invade the small arteries and the distal end of the bronchioles, obstructive emphysema occurs, cysts and vesicles are formed and rupture, and there are many eosinophils in the interstitial granuloma. , neutrophils and lymphocytes infiltrate.","['lymph node enlargement', 'bacterial infection', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'granuloma', 'appetite loss', 'urinary collapse']",['paralysis'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric synthesis']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
aplastic anemia,"aplastic anemia (aa) is a disease in which bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow microenvironment are severely damaged by physical, chemical, biological or unidentified factors, resulting in reduced or depleted bone marrow hematopoietic function. a group of syndromes.according to the survey of 21 provinces (municipalities) in china, the annual incidence rate is 0.74/100,000 people, which is significantly lower than the incidence of leukemia; the incidence of chronic aplastic anemia is 0.60/100,000, and the rate of acute aplastic anemia is 0.14/100,000. all age groups can develop disease, but it is more common in young adults; the incidence rate of males is slightly higher than that of females.","1. in daily life, harmful chemical substances and radioactive substances should be prevented from polluting the environment. 2. in industrial and agricultural production, strict implementation of protective measures to prevent exposure to toxic substances. 3. those who work in contact with toxic chemical substances or radioactive substances should strictly observe the operating procedures and regularly check the body to prevent problems before they occur. 4, patients should take a protective sense of medication, try to reduce the use of chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, especially children should be banned. 5, when taking the drug, we must strictly control the dose, can not rush to find and increase the dose. 6. when using drugs that may cause aplastic anemia, blood changes must be observed regularly, and abnormalities should occur. the drug should be discontinued immediately and actively treated. 7. actively prevent viral hepatitis. for patients with viral hepatitis, they should be actively and systematically treated. 8, to use less or not a variety of solvents, hair dyes, nail polish and other harmful cosmetics. 9, grassroots medical staff should strictly control the indications for medication, try not to use antipyretic drugs such as paracetamol, analgin, etc., so as not to cause aplastic anemia.","drug factors (40%): related to the dose, is a drug toxic effect, reaching a certain dose will cause bone marrow suppression, generally reversible, such as various anti-tumor drugs, cell cycle-specific drugs such as cytarabine and methotrexate chrysalis and the like mainly act on more mature pluripotent stem cells that are easy to divide. therefore, when whole blood cells are reduced, the bone marrow still retains a certain amount of pluripotent stem cells, and the aplastic anemia can be restored after stopping the drug. environmental factors (20%): in industrial production and daily life, people have extensive exposure to benzene (c6h6) and its derivatives. benzene is volatile and easily inhaled into the body. hematological abnormalities in people exposed to benzene more common, including: anemia accounted for 48%, huge erythrocytosis accounted for 47%, thrombocytopenia accounted for 33%, leukopenia accounted for 15%, in the working environment of poor footwear workers, total blood cell reduction accounted for 2.7%, severe benzene poisoning can cause aplastic anemia. viral hepatitis (10%): lorenz reported the first case of viral hepatitis-related aplastic anemia (haaa) in 1955. it is generally believed that the incidence of haaa in patients with viral hepatitis is 0.05% to 0.9%, which is the composition of patients with aplastic anemia. the ratio is 3.2% to 23.9%, 80% of haaa is caused by hepatitis c virus, and a few are caused by hepatitis b virus (hbv). hagler divides haaa into two types. the occurrence of haaa is related to the direct inhibition of hematopoietic stem cells by hepatitis virus. virus-mediated autoimmune abnormalities or anti-stem cell antibodies, viral damage to bone marrow microenvironment, and liver detoxification function also play a role in the pathogenesis of haaa. occupational factors (10%): radiation-induced bone marrow failure is non-random, dose-dependent, and associated with tissue-specific sensitivity, hematopoietic tissue is more sensitive to radiation, and lethal or sublethal dose (4.5 to 10 gy) of whole body irradiation fatal acute aplastic anemia can occur, and chronic aplastic anemia is rarely caused. only a few of the japanese atomic bomb survivors develop delayed aplastic anemia, and high-dose local irradiation can also cause serious damage to the bone marrow microenvironment. the dose of radiation greatly exceeds the lethal dose of progenitor cells, and long-term exposure to small doses of external exposure, such as radiologists or patients with radium or sputum in the body can occur chronic aplastic anemia. pathogenesis the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia is extremely complex and is currently considered to be related to the following aspects. 1. the intrinsic proliferation defect ofhematopoietic stem cellsis the main pathogenesis of aplastic anemia. the basis is as follows: (1) the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow of aplastic anemia are significantly reduced: the ability of stem cell colony formation is significantly reduced, abnormal stem cells can inhibit the function of normal stem cells, and scope and other anti-cd34 and anti-cd33 monoclonal antibody was used for two-color immunofluorescence staining of 15 patients with different severity aa and 11 normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells (bmmnc). the cells of aa and normal were detected by fluorescence activated cell sorting (facs). the number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells was found to be 68% lower (p<0.01) for cd34 cells, 47% for cd33 cells, and 67% for cd34/cd33-, cd34/cd33 and cd34-/cd33 cells, respectively. % and 44%, cd34+ cells were sorted from the bone marrow of normal and aa patients by facs method, and inoculated into irradiated normal stromal cells to invert ltbmc, respectively. the results showed that cd34 granule-macrophage colonies of aa patients ( cfu-gm) yield was (3.1 I 1.9) colonies / 105 cd34 cells [normal control (74 I 22) colonies / 105 cd34 cells]; explosive red colony (bfu-e) was (7 I 8) colonies / 105 cd34 cells [normal control 211 I 6 5 colonies / 105 cd34 cells], p <0.01. (2) the dna repair ability of saa patients was significantly reduced: it could not be corrected after treatment with anti-lymphocyte globulin (alg). (3) some cases effective with immunosuppressive therapy: evolved into clonal diseases during long-term follow-up, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, tichelli et al. eight years after atg/alg treatment, the incidence of these advanced clonal diseases was as high as 57%. (4) these patients have a certain number of complement-sensitive cells in vivo: in vitro experiments have also demonstrated that aplasticized hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells are more sensitive to complement. (5) application of three x-linked genes (phosphoglucose kinase gene, hypoxanthine ribose phosphotransferase gene, dxs255 detected by m27汕 probe): detection of aplastic anemia found that 11.1% to 77% of cases are monoclonal hematopoiesis; josten et al. used m27汕 probe to measure 36 cases of female aa patients. only one case of whole blood cells showed monoclonal type. kamp et al combined with pgk, h 汕 rt and m27h three probes detected 19 cases of aa, and 18 cases could be performed. in clonality analysis, 13 (72.2%) patients were monoclonal, and 4 of them were further studied to isolate and purify their myeloid cells and lymphocytes, both of which were of monoclonal origin, indicating that early stem cells were involved, tsuae in addition, pgk, mbprt and m27h probes were used to detect 20 children with aa, and 18 cases could be cloned. two of them (11.1%) granulocytes and fibroblasts were of monoclonal origin, aa clone hematopoiesis does not imply clonal proliferation, which may reflect the depletion of hematopoietic stem cell pools and severe bone marrow failure. (6) bone marrow transplantation (bmt) between the unpretreated twins was successful. 2. abnormal immune response damage hematopoietic stem cells the autoimmune function of patients with aplastic anemia after immunosuppressive therapy may be improved. this is the most direct evidence for abnormal immune response to damage hematopoietic stem cells. allogeneic bmt treatment of saa requires pretreatment with immunosuppressive agents to mobilize. t lymphocytes (mainly cd8 t cell subsets) in patients with aplastic anemia are closely related to hematopoietic failure, and are often activated in acute aplastic anemia t lymphocytes, which can inhibit the formation of colonies of autologous and allogeneic progenitor cells. zoumbos et al. the patient's t4/t8 ratio was inverted, and the activity of t8 cells was increased. the cells inhibited hematopoiesis and release of inhibitors in vitro. gascon determined 15 cases of aplastic anemia tac cells, 11 of which increased, and the expression of tac antigen increased lymphocytes. the group was in a ※pre-activated state§. mentzel et al analyzed 9 patients with aplastic anemia and found that the 污汛-t cell subset expressed 汛tcsl phenotype significantly increased. blustone et al believed that 污汛-t cells, especially 汛tcs1-t cells, may inhibit hematopoiesis. role, aberrant patients with serum interferon (ifn-污), tumor necrosis factor (tnf-汐) and interleukin-2 (il-2) and other hematopoietic negative regulators increasingly, the expression of ifn-污 gene is enhanced in the bone marrow cells of patients, and antibodies inhibiting the growth of autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells can be detected in individual aplastic anemia patients. the transcription level of stem cell inhibitory factor (sci) rna is significantly increased. plantanias et al found that ifn-污 is significantly reduced in patients with aplastic anemia who are effective in immunotherapy, and can neutralize endogenous ifn-污 or ifn-汐 in vitro. the patient's bone marrow cfu-gm yield was multiplied, and ifn-污 was released after dengue virus infection, causing lymphotoxic reaction, causing damage to stem cells and aplastic anemia. shinjinakai et al used pcr to detect cytostatic factors in 23 aplastic anemia cells. gene expression, found that ifn-污 mrna is clearly expressed in aplastic anemia patients, and has nothing to do with blood transfusion, transforming growth factor (tgf-汕) is a core factor of negative hematopoietic regulation, reversible inhibition of hematopoietic precursor cells role, which is characterized by selective inhibition of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells that depend on hematopoietic factors such as il-3, gm-csf, il-6 and il-9. in recent years, many interleukins have been recognized to be involved in the hematopoietic process. some have the role of csf cofactors, and some have colony stimulating factor activity. nakao et al detected 17 cases of aplastic anemia, and found 10 cases of il-1 significantly reduced, 9 of which were saa, and some patients with aplastic anemia had significant il-2. increase, department sub-patients with significantly reduced il-3 (scf), recently reported the use of il-1 and il-3 in foreign countries and anti-il-2 receptor monoclonal antibody to treat aplastic anemia, natural killer cells (nk) can inhibit more mature hematopoiesis progenitor cell colony growth, human nk cells also have the ability to produce il-2/ifn-污, il-1 and csf and other lymphokines. yashhiro et al detected 12 cases of aplastic anemia in peripheral blood nk cells, the above results indicate the pathogenesis of the disorder has a certain relationship with the immune mechanism, but the fact that the immunosuppressant can not completely cure the aplastic anemia indicates that the aplastic anemia is not a classic autoimmune disease. the abnormal immune response is only one of the factors of aplastic anemia. 3. hematopoietic microenvironment supports functional defects the hematopoietic microenvironment includes stromal cells and their secreted cytokines, which support the proliferation of hematopoietic cells and promote the growth and development of various cells. there is no sufficient evidence to suggest that bone marrow stromal defects in aplastic anemia patients, but aplastic anemia bone marrow fibroblast colonies are found. the formation unit (cfu-f) and stromal cells produced a decrease in colony stimulating activity (csa). the institute of hematology, chinese academy of medical sciences observed atrophy, bone marrow stromal cell atrophy, fatification, cfu-f reduction, and acute aplastic anemia. barrier injury is more serious. most in vitro tests show that there is no abnormality in hematopoietic growth factor (hgf) production from bone marrow stromal cells in aplastic anemia, erythropoietin (epo) in blood and urine of aa patients, and colony-stimulating factor (gm) in granulocyte-macrophage cell line. -csf), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) and macrophage cell colony-stimulating factor (m-csf) levels increased; but aa patients have decreased il-1 production, studies have confirmed hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in aa patients in particular, bfu-e is significantly less reactive to epo, epo+il-3 and epo+scf than normal controls, and even lacks reactivity. wodnar-filipowicz et al. detected serum soluble stem cell factor (s) in 32 saa patients. at the level of cf), serum scf levels in saa patients were found to be lower than those in normal controls, but the difference was not significant. the serum scf level was higher in patients with higher prognosis. if aa is due to hgf deficiency, then theoretically hgf can be cured. aa, in fact, a large number of clinical treatment results show that hgf (including scf) can only transiently increase the peripheral blood cell level of patients, and can not change the natural course of the disease, some patients are not effective for hgf treatment, although the hematopoietic microenvironment is not caused the cause of aa, but can aggravate the condition. 4. genetic prediscipline arrhythmia often has hla-dr2 type antigen chain tendency, hla-dpw3 type antigen in children with aplastic anemia is significantly increased, and the proliferative ability of hematopoietic progenitor cells is often reduced in patients' families, and familial aplastic anemia is seen. the susceptibility of chloramphenicol is genetically controlled, and the susceptibility to other toxicants or viruses may also be related to genetic factors. the above phenomenon indicates that a small number of aplastic anemias have a genetic predisposition to ""fragile"" bone marrow hematopoietic function.","['bone marrow hematopoietic cell aplasia', 'anemia', 'hemoglobinuria', 'dizziness', 'weakness', 'hematopoietic dysfunction', 'heart palpitations']",['moon of the month'],"['internal

polycythemia vera,"polycythemia vera (referred to as true red) is a kind of chronic myeloproliferative disease with erythrocytosis and white blood cells and thrombocytosis. the total blood volume is absolutely increased, the blood is thick, and the clinical manifestations are red, purple and dizzy. , dizziness, headache, high blood pressure, hepatosplenomegaly, severe patients may have blood vessels, bleeding complications, infarction and so on.","the disease belongs to myeloproliferative diseases, and there are no clear preventive measures at present.","causes of the formation of ""endogenous"" erythroid clones: when bone marrow cultured in vitro, normal bone marrow cells form late erythroid progenitor colonies (cfu-e) need to add epo to the culture medium, while bone marrow cells of pv patients do not join epo. that is, it can grow, suggesting that the erythrocyte clones that do not rely on epo production have ""tumor"" properties. if the bone marrow culture of pv patients is additionally added with epo, then in the formed cfu-e, there are both pv cells, and there are normal red blood cells, indicating that in addition to pv cell clones in pv patients, normal stem cells remain, but their proliferation is inhibited by pv clones. it is believed that abnormal clones of pv originate from a single cell, continue to proliferate, and have the advantage of inhibiting normal clones. with cytogenetic instability, clinically found cases of pv conversion to acute leukemia. the erythroid progenitor cells are more sensitive to epo: when the bone marrow cells of pv patients and normal humans are cultured in stem cells, the same concentration of epo is added, and the number of early erythroid progenitor colonies (bfu-e) and cfu-e in pv patients are higher than normal. significantly increased, and the growth of cfu-e was significantly increased when patients did not add epo. when epo antibody was added to the culture, the number of cfu-e production in pv patients decreased. the above results suggest that the sensitivity of erythroid progenitor cells to epo in pv patients is enhanced. this is one of the reasons for the increase in red blood cells. apoptosis of pluripotent stem cells: normal red blood cells contain isoforms of two glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenases (g-6-pd), type a and type b, while red, granulocytes and platelets of pv patients contain only type a in one type, fibroblasts and lymphocytes still contain a, b type g-6-pd isoenzymes, indicating that the disease is a single clonal disease originating from the same pluripotent stem cell level. abnormal apoptosis: some studies have found that the survival time of nucleated red blood cells in pv patients is significantly longer than that in normal people. pv colonies are highly sensitive to il-3 and scf, and these factors can delay the apoptosis of erythroid progenitor cells. pv patients and normal controls developed apoptosis in culture conditions lacking cytokines, but pv patients had less apoptosis than normal controls, and this difference may be related to high expression of bcl-2 in pv patients. others: another experiment suggests that there may be a glycoprotein in the serum of pv patients, which can stimulate red blood cell production and stimulate the granulocytes and platelets. it is called bone marrow stimulating factor. the antigenicity of this factor is different from that of epo, but a small amount of epo is needed. participation can work, and its nature needs further study.","['bleeding tendency', 'tooth bleeding', 'tiredness', 'clothing jade', 'sinus', 'hair sputum', 'double vision', 'nose bleeding']",['spleen big'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,"paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh), a chronic intravascular hemolysis caused by acquired erythrocyte membrane defects, often worsened during sleep, may be associated with paroxysmal hemoglobinuria and pancytopenia, although this disease is rare, but in recent years, there has been an increasing trend.more than half of the north of china is in the south, and more than half of them are young adults aged 20-40, and some are under 10 years old and over 70 years old.more men than women, pnh has always been classified as hemolytic disease, but in addition to anemia is often accompanied by a decrease in neutrophils and (or) platelets, and molecular lesions of pnh involve various blood cells, so in recent years some authors regard pnh as hematopoietic stem cell disease.the main cause of death is infection in the country and vascular embolism in foreign countries.","the pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is not completely clear, so it is not known how to prevent the occurrence of this disease, but it is clear that some factors can induce or aggravate hemoglobinuria, so patients should pay attention to avoid infection, especially upper respiratory tract infection; avoid excessive fatigue or mental stress; avoid abuse of drugs, etc., because the disease is imaginary, it is necessary to reconcile the spirit and nurse the body, ""just in the air, evil can not be done"", can properly practice qigong, taijiquan, to improve resistance.","pnh is an acquired disease, there has never been a report of congenital onset (except for congenital cd59 deficiency), and there is no tendency for familial aggregation. the exact cause of hematopoietic stem cell lesions is unclear. this disease is an acquired pluripotent hematopoiesis. stem cell diseases, pathogenic factors may be chemical, radiation or viral infections, pathogenic chromosome mutations, abnormal stem cell lines, proliferation, differentiation of red blood cells, granulocytes and platelets have common defects. therefore, it is speculated that some pnh may have more than one abnormal clone. pnh patients' red blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets all have membrane protein deletions. it is conceivable that gene mutations must occur in very early hematopoietic stem cells. however, it is unclear why there are genetic mutations in pnh patients and what are the foreign mutagens. in addition, in view of the fact that pnh patients often have more than one abnormal clone, there is more than one pig-a gene mutation; in 2002, horikawa k et al also reported that a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) gene, which is not associated with the pathogenesis of pnh, is also susceptible to mutations in pnh patients, in other words, pnh patients. there were more pig-a mutations and hprt mutations than those without normal pig-a mutations, suggesting that there is also intrinsic gene instability in the exogenous mutagen, but purow db et al. also observed two unrelated genes in pnh patients, hprt and tcr genes, in 1999. the results showed that individual pnh patients also had the above two genes. one mutation, and the majority of these two genes did not change, so whether pnh patients have widespread genetic instability remains to be confirmed. abnormal cloning of pnh patients does not have the nature of autonomous infinite amplification, but after all, there must be a certain expansion ability to increase the number of abnormal cells enough to produce disease manifestations, in view of the fact that pnh often interacts with aplastic anemia (aa) or at the same time, it is thought that whether the two are related to the etiology, that is, the pnh clone can only be expanded when the normal hematopoietic cells are inhibited. therefore, in addition to the mutagen, it is necessary to think of many causes of aa. for example, due to certain factors such as viruses, drugs, etc., which can inhibit autoimmune diseases of hematopoietic cells, this is the dual cause of pnh or the two-step pathogenesis. pathogenesis the pathogenesis of pnh involves more than one factor. 1. gene mutation causes the appearance of abnormal cell clones. pnh abnormal blood cells have the common feature that the surface of the cell membrane lacks a group of membrane proteins. these membrane proteins are linked to the membrane by glycositol phospholipids (gpi), collectively called glycositol phospholipid connexin (gpi connexin), the protein involved and gpi are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum. once a protein is formed, it is immediately linked to the gpi, and then the outer layer of the cell membrane is transferred. since pnh cells can detect the free protein and the corresponding mrna, it can be inferred that pnh abnormal cells lack gpi connexin, not because they cannot produce protein, but because they cannot produce gpi, so this protein cannot exist on the membrane. gpi consists of lipid part and core structure, and lipid part of different kinds of gpi. the difference is very large, but the core structure is very conservative, consisting of 1 inositol phospholipid, 1 glucosamine, 3 mannose and 1 ethanolamine in sequence, one fatty acid on the inositol phospholipid (some are three) are inserted into the outer layer of the lipid membrane of the cell membrane, and the other end is connected to the protein by ethanolamine. one key enzyme is required for each step of gpi production. in recent years, abnormal lymphocytes infected with pnh (such as b lymphocytes infected with epstein-barr virus) have been used to establish cell lines, and different thymoma cell lines that are known to lack gpi in mice and have a clear gpi production disorder occurred in that step [thy] -1(-) cell line is fused, and if expressed, gpi connexin can be expressed, indicating that the defects of the two are different and can be complementary; if the gpi connexin is not expressed after fusion, the defects are the same, so they are not complementary. with this method of cell fusion, it has been demonstrated in 40 patients that the defects of pnh abnormal cells are all the same as those of type a thy-1(-) cells. the lack of gpi is due to the first step in the production of gpi, namely n- acetylglucosamine cannot be added to phosphoinositide (pi), so it is no longer possible to add 3 mannose and 1 ethanolamine to form a complete gpi decatenin. label the different components of gpi with radionuclide and observe gpi. in the process of production, it can also be found that pnh abnormal cells cannot produce gpi due to the above-mentioned obstacles. it is known that pnh abnormal cells lack one protein and have great homology with mouse acetylglucosamine transferase. the cdna and gene nucleotide sequences of this protein have been clarified, and the pig-a gene was expressed by fluorescence in situ hybridization at the p22.1 site of the x chromosome. studies have shown that it is found in the blood cells of all tested pnh patients. mutation of the pig-a gene results in the partial or total deletion of the gpi connexin, indicating that the pig-a gene mutation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pnh. the cdna of pig-a is 1452 bp, encoding 484 amino acids. the nucleotide sequence of pig-a gene is more than 17 kbp in length, and there are 6 exons: the first exon is only 23 bp, encoding the 5' untranslated region; the second exon has 777 bp, encoding the other part of the 5' untranslated region and about half of the protein; the third exon has 133 bp, encoding a portion of the protein; the fourth exon is 133 bp, encoding a portion of the protein; the 5th exon is 207 bp, encoding a part of the protein; the 6th exon is 2316 bp long, encoding the rest of the protein and the 3' untranslated region, and the 5' flanking 583 bp region of the pig-a gene has promoter activity. there is no tata-like sequence in this region, there are 4 caat boxes, 2 ap-2 sequences, 1 cre sequence, and the pig.a gene has 2 alternative splicing products, which are 347 and 658 nucleotides, respectively, so it is normal. the rt-pcr product of pig-a mrna also has three bands, 1500 bp, 1250 bp, and 850 bp, respectively, and the latter products have no function. pnh-a gene mutation of pnh is heterogeneous. more than 100 gene mutations have been reported so far, widely distributed in multiple coding regions and splicing sites, no mutation clusters or hot spots, and mainly small mutations, large the mutation is rare, and the pnh-a mutation has no significant difference in the genetic map of pnh compared with the aa-pnh syndrome. according to rosse et al. (1995), the results of 72 patients in 11 laboratories have been reported. of the mutations, 53 were nucleotide deletions or insertions, of which 42 were deletions; about 1/3 (24 of 84 mutations) had only 1 nucleotide deletion, and only 2 mutations had large segments ( deletion of more than 100 nucleotides; relatively few nucleotide insertions, 5 cases of deletions and insertions at the same time, the main consequence of deletion or insertion is frameshift, 45 of 51 small deletions or (and) insertion mutations premature termination code causes protein to decrease, 1 crosses the termination code to increase the protein by 32 amino acids, and 4 deletion mutations change the exon/intron splicing site, affecting the size and stability of pig-a mrna. sex, there is another deletion in the box, the lack of 3 nucleotides makes the protein lack the 151st ammonia base acid (phenylalanine), 1/3 of all mutations (31 of 84 mutations) are point mutations, and 1 nucleotide is replaced by another nucleotide, in these 31 point mutations: 18 are missense mutations, so that one amino acid in the amino acid sequence of the protein is replaced by another amino acid; 6 are nonsense mutations, resulting in an immediate termination code; 7 are splicing point mutations, affecting the size of pig-a mrna and stability. no point mutations in the 5' promoter region or the 3' untranslated region of the pig-a gene have been found so far, and one large deletion involves the promoter region, the first exon and part of the first intron, kinoshita et al. (1995) obtained the same understanding from 62 cases. all pnh patients had pig-a gene mutations, and the mutation sites were randomly distributed. of the 62 cases, 56 mutations involved only 1 or 2 base changes, and the consequences of mutation were shifted. the most common code (63%), different types of pig-a gene mutations in different patients, only 5 of the 62 cases were found in 2, 3 patients, if the same patient has 2 abnormal cells (gpi connexin no or missing, it may be caused by two abnormal clones produced by two mutations, but in fact some patients can only find one mutation although there are two abnormal cells, and some patients have only one gpi connexin completely missing. abnormal cells, but can detect two mutations, these cases need to be carefully examined, luzzatto in 2000 analyzed 28 of the 146 pnh patients reported in the world 174 pig-a mutations, of which 135 (including large sections will it is the complete inactivation of the pig-a gene product. in the other group, 35 were missense mutations and 4 were small in-frame deletions. as a result, the pig-a gene product was partially functionally deleted. the cells formed in the former group completely lacked gpi connexin (equivalent to pnh iii type cells). ), the latter group of cells partially deleted gpi connexin (equivalent to pnhii type cells), and norris et al. initially studied the effects of different pig-a gene mutation sites on the structure and function of pig-a protein. the authors analyzed 18 for example, the missense mutation of the pig-a gene was found to be located in the coding sequences 128-129 and 15l-156. these coding sequences are located in highly conserved regions of mouse and yeast pig-a homologous genes. therefore, conjecture these coding sequences may encode a key part of the pig-a protein. the authors obtained the pig-a cdna with these coding mutations by point mutagenesis and transferred them to prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems to measure their pig-a protein. the structure and function of the gene indicate that a missense mutation in the coding for histidine 128 (h128), serine 129 (s129) and serine 155 (s155) results in partial loss of pig-a protein function and occurs in coding. encoding of side chain amino acid residues sense mutations in pig-a had no effect on protein function, cue coding h128, s129 and s155 is the key part of the encoded sub-pig-a affect protein function. in conclusion, the pig-a mutation site of pnh patients is spread over multiple sites in the entire coding region of exon 2-6, and among some introns, there is no mutation hotspot, the second exon is longer, and the mutation site is also there are many types of mutations, and the pig-a mutations of different patients are often different. at present, only a few of the same mutations are found in different patients, but it is not known whether patients in different countries may differ. according to reports, in japan 20 among the mutations, 9 were base substitutions, and only 1 was a polybase deletion; while in thailand, only 2 of them were base substitutions, but 4 were multibase deletions; large fragments were missing in european and american countries. more common than in japan, i wonder if the mutagens in different places will be different. transfer of normal pig-a cdna into pnh abnormal cells can correct the defect that the latter does not express gpi connexin. pnh can be confirmed by mutation of pig-a gene. however, at least 12 genes involved in the whole process of gpi production. in addition to pig-a, there are pig-c, pig-h, etc., but except for pig-a, other genes are located on the autosome, and two alleles are simultaneously inactivated. the probability is very small, and the pig-a gene is located on the x chromosome. even in women, the x chromosome that is mutated is not randomly inactivated, so no mutations other than the pig-a gene mutation have been found. pnh. 2. maintenance and amplification of abnormal cell clones how to maintain and continue to expand after cell clone formation, especially in the presence of normal hematopoietic cells, how the abnormal cells compete, and the number increases enough to cause disease manifestation, it is still unclear, and there are two aspects that can be conceived: (1) abnormal cells are not easy to be apoptotic, and their vitality is strong: in 1997, brodsky ra et al. and horikawa k reported that abnormal blood cells of pnh patients have the ability to resist apoptosis. this is used to explain the increase in the proportion of abnormal cells, but the next year ware re et al. (1998) reported that there is no difference in the rate of neutrophil apoptosis in neutrophils with gpi connexin and in the absence of gpi connexin; the cdna of -a was introduced into the b-lymphocyte strain of pnh phenotype. there was no difference in fas ligand or x-ray induced apoptosis between the cells before and after introduction, indicating that the loss of pig-a gene does not affect apoptosis, given this different observation, whether pnh abnormal cells are not easy to apoptosis remains to be further studied. in the future, we should focus on the early hematopoietic cells and compare the abnormalities and normalities of pnh patients. similar normal cells, under physiological conditions, or may occur in vivo under apoptotic conditions. (2) abnormal cells have stronger proliferative capacity: the mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease that are sublethally irradiated are infused with bone marrow of pnh patients or normal people. after 7 months, the normal bone marrow disappears, and the bone marrow of pnh patients remains. existence, han bing et al., 2000, used flow cytometry to sort out cd34 cd59 cells from pnh patients compared with their own cd34+ cd59- cells and normal human cd34+ cd59 cells. the results were either single cell culture or population cell culture. in liquid medium, it was shown that the cd34 cd59- cells in pnh patients had more division, colony formation and total number of amplification than cd34+ cd59 cells, and both were worse than normal human cd34+ cells. it is suggested that the abnormal phenotype of early hematopoietic cells in pnh patients is stronger than that of normal phenotypes, but neither is the corresponding cells of normal humans. in other words, abnormal cells of pnh have certain effects on their normal cells. proliferative advantage, and the patient's so-called normal cells are actually abnormal in terms of proliferative capacity. however, xiao juan et al. used the immunomagnetic strain method to sort cells in the same period, and failed to show the proliferation advantage of pnh abnormal phenotype cells in both liquid culture and semi-solid culture. however, the patient's normal phenotype and abnormal phenotype the proliferative capacity of early hematopoietic cells is far worse than that of normal human cells, and it has been confirmed again. it is also reported that the same gene bone marrow transplantation is performed for pnh patients. if the proper pretreatment is not performed, the disease will relapse after it has been relieved. it is also shown that pnh clones have a proliferation advantage. however, scholars who believe that pig-a gene-inactivated hematopoietic cells do not have intrinsic proliferation advantages can also cite some examples: for example, embryonic stem cells inactivated by pig-a gene cannot survive and grow. if the pig-a gene is inactivated during early embryonic development and the chimera is successfully produced, only 5% of the red blood cells and neutrophils lack gpi-linked protein when he starts hematopoiesis, and then the percentage is gradually reduced and finally stabilized, indicating that the cells there is no tendency to continue to proliferate; as another example, araten dj et al. (1999) found that most normal humans have red blood cells and neutrophils lacking cd55 and cd59.they are 22/1 million and 8/1 million, respectively, and can also detect pig-a gene mutations, but do not develop into diseases. in short, whether pnh abnormal clones have intrinsic growth advantages is inconclusive, but overall pnh patients the ability of hematopoietic cells to proliferate (whether normal or abnormal) is below normal and can be determined. (3) pnh abnormal cloning is based on the attenuation of normal hematopoietic function of bone marrow to obtain relative growth advantages: li qiang et al (1997), xiao juan et al (2000), han bing et al (2000) in their own work. the same phenomenon was found, that the cd34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow of pnh patients were less than normal, and cd59- cells were significantly more than cd59+, suggesting that the number of normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in pnh patients is small, abnormal hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells have a comparative advantage in quantity. it can be speculated that pnh abnormal clones are expanded on the basis of normal hematopoietic failure. in 2001, pakdeesuwan k of thailand also had similar observations. as early as 1961, dacie and lewis proposed clinically, pnh is closely related to aplastic anemia. later, many scholars confirmed and believed that the two are also related to the pathogenesis. in recent years, one view is that pig-a gene mutation can occur in normal people and in many cases. however, only when the normal hematopoietic function is depleted, it is possible to develop into a disease. even pnh is considered to be necessary for aplastic anemia, and attention will be focused on autoimmune re on the other hand, it is suggested that there are some gpi connexins on the surface of normal hematopoietic cells, which can be killed by antigens or costimulatory factors that can stimulate cell killing cells (such as t lymphocytes), and cells with pig-a gene mutations are missing gpi. connexins can thus escape killing. karadimitris a et al. (2000, 2001) suggested that all components of t cells may be found to be abnormal, and gpi connexins are present in the targeting of autoreactive t cells. (4) others: the effect of serum of pnh patients on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, the observation results are different. according to wang yuzhou's observation in 2001, patients' cd59+ or lymphocytes and their culture supernatants have no effect on the proliferation of cd34+ cells. according to han bing in 2000, the colony forming ability of bone marrow fibroblasts in pnh patients was normal, and the mrna expression of tnf汐 and il-6 in fibroblasts was also normal; others observed that epo and g-csf in serum increased. ifn污 is normal, and nishimura et al. proposed that the fgf汕 receptor is also a gpi connexin. the hematopoietic cells of pnh are not inhibited by the proliferation of tgf due to the lack of tgf receptor. in conclusion, although the pathogenesis of pnh has been studied in recent years, pig-a gene mutation and attenuation of normal hematopoietic cell proliferation in bone marrow are two important factors, but how to form an imbalance between abnormal hematopoietic cells and normal hematopoietic cell formation and proliferation. how to determine the number of abnormal cells, the factors affecting the number of abnormal cells and the development and changes of pnh disease, how to obtain natural relief of pnh, and whether the hematopoietic microenvironment has changed, etc., further research is needed.","['proteinuria', 'face pale', 'clothing jade', 'low molecular proteinuria', 'appetite loss', 'hemoglobinuria', 'snoring', 'living', 'disgusting', 'palpitation' ]",['leukemia'],"['internal medicine', 'hematology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

allergic asthma,"allergic asthma is a relatively stubborn disease that can be associated with life if neglected.most people with asthma have allergies or allergic rhinitis. asthma patients with allergic rhinitis have symptoms of sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, itchy eyes, and tearing.because symptoms are similar to respiratory infections or inflammation, adults lack relevant knowledge and often ignore treatment at an early stage and are most likely to be misdiagnosed.","prevention of asthma can be divided into 3 levels: 1. level prevention refers to the purpose of preventing asthma by eliminating the asthmatic factors that are small in the surrounding environment. 2, level prevention refers to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients with major clinical symptoms of asthma to prevent the progression of the disease. 3, level top prevention refers to actively control asthma symptoms, prevent the disease from worsening, reduce complications, improve the quality of life of patients, and improve the patient's condition.","causes inhalation: inhalation is divided into specific and non-specific, the former such as dust mites, pollen, fungi, animal dander, etc.; non-specific inhalants such as sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, chloramine, etc., specific inhalation of occupational asthma such as toluene diisocyanate, phthalic anhydride, ethylenediamine, penicillin, protease, amylase, silk, animal dander or excrement, etc. in addition, non-specific still exists formaldehyde, formic acid and the like. respiratory tract infections: the formation and onset of infection with asthma are associated with repeated respiratory infections. in asthma patients, there may be specific ige of bacteria, viruses, mycoplasmas, etc. if the corresponding antigen is inhaled, it may trigger asthma. after the virus infection, direct damage to the respiratory epithelium, resulting in increased respiratory responsiveness, some scholars believe that the interferon produced by viral infection, il-1 increased the release of histamine from basophils, in the early childhood, respiratory viruses (especially respiratory syncytial virus) after infection, there are many symptoms of asthma symptoms. as a result of parasites such as aphids and hookworms, asthma is still seen in rural areas. dietary relationship: the phenomenon of asthma caused by food relationship is often seen in asthma patients, especially infants and young children are easy to be allergic to food, but gradually decrease with age, the most common food causing allergies is fish, shrimp and crab , eggs, milk, etc. climate change: when temperature, temperature, pressure and/or airborne ions change, asthma can be induced, so it is more common in cold seasons or in autumn and winter climate changes. asthma is related to drugs: some drugs can cause asthma attacks, such as propranolol, which causes asthma by blocking 汕2-adrenergic receptors. about 2.3% to 20% of asthma patients induce asthma by taking aspirin, called aspirin. asthma, patients with nasal polyps and low tolerance to aspirin, it is called aspirin triad, its clinical features are: taking aspirin can induce severe asthma, symptoms appear more than 2 hours after medication, even late until 2 to 4 hours, the patient may have cross-reaction with other antipyretic analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; children with asthma are mostly before the age of 2, but most of them are middle-aged patients, mostly from 30 to 40 years old. more women than men, the ratio of male to female is about 2:3; the attack has no obvious seasonality, the condition is heavier and stubborn, most of them are dependent on hormones; more than half have nasal polyps, often accompanied by perennial allergic rhinitis and or) sinusitis, sometimes worsening asthma symptoms after nasal polyps resection; common inhalation allergen skin test is mostly negative; serum total ige is normal; patients with less allergic diseases in the family,the pathogenesis of this disease has not been fully elucidated. some people think that the patient's bronchial epoxidase may be affected by an infectious agent (probably a virus), which makes the epoxidase susceptible to aspirin inhibition, that is, intolerance to aspirin. therefore, when patients use aspirin, it affects the metabolism of arachidonic acid, inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins, and the imbalance of pge2/pgf2汐, which increases the production of leukotrienes, leading to strong and long-lasting contraction of bronchial smooth muscle.","['cyanosis', 'wheeling sound', 'tracheal obstruction', 'chest tightness', 'breathing', 'sitting breathing']","['chronic bronchitis', 'obstructive emphysema', 'chronic pulmonary heart disease', 'mediastinal emphysema']","['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

sjogren syndrome,"sjogren syndrome (ss) is a chronic autoimmune disease that invades the exocrine glands, especially the salivary glands and lacrimal glands.mainly manifested as dry mouth and eyes, but also multi-organ, multi-system damage.a large number of lymphocytes infiltrate in the affected organs, and various autoantibodies in the serum are positive.this syndrome is also known as autoimmune exocrine disease, autologous syndrome, and sjogren's syndrome.often overlap with other rheumatism or autoimmune diseases.","the etiology of sjogren's syndrome is not fully understood, but it is related to epstein-barr virus infection and is related to genetic factors.active prevention and treatment of eb virus infection should have positive effects in preventing the occurrence of sjogren's syndrome. disability analysis (1) about half of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, mainly invading the knee, elbow, and proximal metacarpophalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints, showing pain and weakness, affecting joint function. (2) 20% to 30% of patients with systemic vasculitis, neurological vasculitis may have neuropsychiatric symptoms, epileptic seizures, hemiplegia, hemianopia, ataxia. (3) the incidence of malignant lymphoma is significantly increased, which can be fatal. 2. personal prevention (1) primary prevention avoid factors that may cause disease, such as wind and heat, dry fire, etc.; life rules, work and rest; strengthen physical exercise, improve immunity; pay attention to health, prevent infection. (2) secondary prevention 1 early diagnosis: sjogren's syndrome is a systemic disease, which can affect various organ systems, and the clinical manifestations are diversified, and the onset is concealed, slowly progressing, and it is difficult to diagnose early. middle-aged women have dental caries, repeated parotid gland enlargement, and repeated eyelids. suppurative infection, purulent discharge of eyelids, non-infectious organ damage, unexplained renal tubular acidosis, chronic pancreatitis, hypergammaglobulinemia, should be highly suspected of this disease, autoantibody examination, eye and mouth the relevant tests help early diagnosis. 2 early treatment: mainly to replace and symptomatic treatment, to prevent secondary lesions caused by dry mouth.","genetic factors (30%) (1) histocompatibility antigen: in recent years, the frequency of some major histocompatibility complex (mhc) genes has increased in patients with sjogren's syndrome, and human mhc is also called human. human leucocyte antigen (hla), associated with sjogren's syndrome, is hla-dr3, hla-b8. this correlation may vary from race to race and is reported to be associated with hla-b8 in western european sjogren's syndrome. related to dr3, drw52, hla-dr5 in greece, hla-dr53 in japan, hla-dr8 in china, and drw52 in male patients, hla gene and sjogren's syndrome itself there are also correlations between antibody production and clinical manifestations. for example, sjogren's syndrome with hla-dr3 and dq1/dq2 has high titers of anti-ssa, ssb antibodies, clinical symptoms, and vasculitis. these results suggest that some class ii hla genes may be genetic markers of susceptibility to sjogren's syndrome. they play an important role in the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and disease persistence of sjogren's syndrome, but in non-dry synthesisa large number of healthy people in the levy also have hla-dr3 or dr8. therefore, the genetic basis is only one of the causes of sjogren's syndrome. it is necessary to have other factors involved in the disease to cause the onset of sjogren's syndrome. (2) family history: sjogren's syndrome patients have sisters, mothers and daughters at the same time, which also suggests that there are genetic factors in the cause of the disease. virus infection (25%) it is believed that a variety of viruses are associated with the onset of sjogren's syndrome and the persistence of the disease, such as epstein-barr virus, herpesvirus type 6, cytomegalovirus, retrovirus, and the like. (1) epstein-barr (eb) virus: it is a common herpesvirus that infects humans. it has the property of activating b cells with high proliferation. it is characterized by hyperglobulinemia, which can be converted into b lymphocyte tumors. in patients with syndrome, the early antigen (ea) and dna of epstein-barr virus in the lacrimal gland, salivary gland, and renal tubular epithelial cells indicate that epstein-barr virus is actively replicating in sjogren's syndrome patients, which continuously activates b cell proliferation and differentiation. the disease continues to linger; other scholars have also detected the dna of epstein-barr virus from normal human salivary gland biopsy specimens, so it is suspected that epstein-barr virus is the cause of this disease. (2) retrovirus: human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infected with retrovirus may have dry syndrome, parotid gland swelling and other symptoms of sjogren's syndrome, and 30% of patients with sjgren's syndrome in serum an antibody to the hiv component p24gag protein was detected; in htlv-1 (human t lymphocytic leukemia virus, another retrovirus), sjogren's syndrome-like symptoms also appeared, so some people think that hiv infection may be sjogren's syndrome. however, although hiv patients have mouth and dry eyes, they do not have anti-ssa and ssb antibodies in serum. they are not related to hla-dr3. in addition, some sle patients also have anti-p24 antibodies in their serum, so they cannot explain hiv or htlv. -1 is the direct cause of sjogren's syndrome. (3) hepatitis c virus: the us literature reports that hepatitis c virus has no significance in sjogren's syndrome, unless accompanied by mixed cryoglobulinemia or other diseases, such as membrane proliferative nephritis, a report in france found in the original in the sjogren's syndrome, hepatitis c virus infection is about 10%. these viruses can occur in the salivary glands of the lips, and it is considered that hepatitis c virus infection is one of the causes of sjogren's syndrome. italian scholars believe that hepatitis c virus is dry. there is no effect on the autonomic organ damage of the syndrome. the form of lymphocyte lesion damage in chronic hepatitis c is different from that of primary sjogren's syndrome. endocrine factors (25%) estrogen levels in patients with sjogren's syndrome are elevated, and most patients with sjogren's syndrome are women, presumably associated with elevated estrogen. the disease can be found in the mouth, eyes, etc., and then the muscles and joints of the extremities, followed by internal organs are dirty; muscle and joint symptoms and visceral damage can also occur first, followed by signs of dry eyes. pathogenesis cellular immunity (1) lymphocytes: 1 peripheral blood: the total number of lymphocytes and the number of cd4 and cd8 subpopulations of t lymphocytes, the ratio is 70% to 80% of sjogren's syndrome patients are normal, but their functions may be abnormal, it has also been reported that cd8 is reduced the number of t cells with inhibitory function in cd8 is reduced, resulting in a large proliferation of b cells. cd5 b-labeled lymphocytes increase by up to 30% to 40% in dryness syndrome (normally only 15% to 25%). the cells belong to poorly differentiated or incompletely mature cells, which spontaneously secrete igm-rf and anti-single-stranded dna antibodies (anti-ss-dna antibodies), so there is a significant differentiation of t and b lymphocytes in the blood surrounding sjogren's syndrome. mature and dysfunctional. 2 in the labial gland: a large number of lymphocyte clusters can be seen in the interstitial tissue of the parotid gland, which is mainly composed of t cells, and t cells in the t cells with the activated marker 4b4 /cd45ro predominate. 4b4 cells are activated t cells with complementary memory function. most of the cells in the labial gland and ductal epithelial cells express hla-dr molecules, further indicating t and b cells in the labial gland of sjgren's syndrome. both ductal epithelial cells were activated, and the same changes were seen in the small lacrimal gland tissue of the conjunctiva of sjogren's syndrome. (2) natural killer cells: natural killer cells are a group of extremely large lymphocytes. the number of natural killer cells in the peripheral blood of sjogren's syndrome is normal, but the function is decreased, and monocytes in their exocrine glands (lip glands) such cells are absent from infiltrating lesions. 2. the prominent manifestations of patients with humoral immune sjogren's syndrome are hyperglobulinemia and various autoantibodies, reflecting the high hyperfunction of b lymphocyte function and the inhibition of t lymphocyte suppression. (1) hyperglobulinemia: gamma globulin in 95% of patients has increased to varying degrees, most of which are polyclonal, immunoglobulin igg, igm, iga can be increased, with igg increasing the most see, igm or iga is also not uncommon, it can also be increased in monoclonality, a small number of patients can appear 百 or 竹 chain fragments in urine, hyperglobulinemia in sjogren's syndrome compared with other connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis is more prominent, and b lymphocytes also have the function of synthesizing a large number of immunoglobulins in the local tissues of the labial glands. (2) autoantibodies: due to the proliferation of b lymphocytes, this disease produces a variety of autoantibodies. 1 anti-ssa (ro) antibody and anti-ssb (la) antibody: they are closely related to sjogren's syndrome, and can also occur in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, all of which are of igg type. the antigen recognized by anti-ssa antibody is intracytoplasmic. the small rna (hy5rna) is linked to the 60kd and 52kd protein components, both of which belong to the ribonucleoprotein complex. 80% of the antibodies that act on 52kd are from sjogren's syndrome serum, and the antibodies that act on 60kd are often from sle. about 85% of sjogren's syndrome has antibodies against 52kd and 60kd. the anti-ssb antibody recognizes 47kd protein, which is different from the 60kd and 52kd proteins. anyone with anti-ssb antibody has anti-antibiotics. ssa antibody, because the ssb molecule and ssa are linked together, the ssb rna may be linked to a variety of proteins, including 70kd, snrnp a and b/b proteins, ssa 60kd protein, anti-ssa, ssb antibody to sjogren's syndrome the diagnosis has played a big role. two types of rheumatoid factor (rf): rf is an autoantibody that binds to the igg-fc segment. it occurs in a variety of autoimmune diseases such as sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. the positive rate of igm-rf in sjogren's syndrome is about 50%, lower than ra (70%), higher than sle (30%), and the rf positive rate accounts for more than 90% in our sjogren's syndrome cases. igm-rf also it can occur in some tumors, infections and other non-rheumatic diseases, where it only represents the body's immune disorder, but no specificity. 3 others: anticardiolipin antibody (aca) (25%), anti-mitochondrial antibody (20%), low titer anti-double-stranded dna antibody (anti-ds-dna antibody) (10%), anti-rnp antibody, and the like. 4 anti-organ antibodies: patients with sjogren's syndrome can also appear anti-thyroid duct antibody, anti-thyroid antibodies, anti-corporeal cell antibodies. (3) immune complex: about 80% of sjogren's syndrome has circulating immune complexes, which are formed by a large number of autoantibodies and antigens combined and due to reticular endothelial system clearance dysfunction, serum cryoglobulin appears, often representing there is damage outside the gland. (4) cytokines: the cytokines (il-1汕, il-6, tnf-汐, ifn-污) secreted by blood lymphocytes around sjogren's syndrome and the serum cytokine levels were not abnormal. the levels of il-2 and tnf-汐 in serum decreased, and mr-na expression of il-1汕, il-6, tnf-汐 and ifn-污 was expressed in labial epithelial cells and mononuclear cells, suggesting that cytokines are involved. sjogren's syndrome local, the pathogenesis of labia. (5) abnormal immune function, t, b lymphocytes in peripheral blood have obvious differentiation, maturation, and functional abnormalities. the animal model of sjogren's syndrome has premature thymic decline and decreased t lymphocyte function. b lymphocyte hyperfunction appears in a variety of autoantibodies that produce immune damage, and human sjogren's syndrome may have a similar pathogenesis. 3. pathology the salivary glands, lacrimal glands, and any organs in the body can be affected, and there are two major pathological changes. (1) exocrine gland inflammation: there is a large amount of lymphocytes, including plasma cells and monocytes, infiltrating between the exocrine glands composed of columnar epithelial cells. this aggregated lymphocyte infiltrative lesion is a characteristic pathological change of this disease. appears in the salivary glands (including the small parotid glands of the lips, ankles), lacrimal glands (including the small lacrimal glands of the conjunctiva), renal interstitial, interstitial lung, digestive tract mucosa, hepatic portal, bile ducts and lymph nodes, eventually leading to local the epithelial cells of the ducts and glands proliferate, followed by degeneration, atrophy, destruction, and the loss of their proper function by replacing the fibrous tissue. some people in the salivary gland and the lacrimal gland have a large amount of lymphocyte infiltration called pseudo-lymph. tumor. (2) vasculitis: caused by cryoglobulinemia, hyperglobulinemia or immune complex deposition, is the pathological basis of this disease complicated by glomerulonephritis, peripheral and central nervous system lesions, rash, and raynaud's phenomenon. 4. the etiology and pathogenesis of tcm is higher than that of the normal population. therefore, when the lymphocyte infiltration is more prominent and the cell morphology is more primitive, attention should be paid to the possibility of malignant lesions. if the local lymphocyte structure is damaged, it means it has been converted to a malignant lymphoma. the cause is dryness and internal dryness. the disease is caused by internal dryness. the ""nei jing"" has a cloud: ""the dryness is dry"", and the later liu hehe pointed out in the ""su wen xuanji original disease"": ""zhu yu dryness, dryness and sputum are all dry, and the disease caused by dryness is the most seasonal. after the autumn equinox, the main thing of the dry gold is that the people are steamed by xiayueyan, the liquid is sweaty, the viscera is dry, and the water is exhausted. feeling dry, or the old luck is dry jinsitian, also easy to feel evil, this is dry; the body's lack of yin liquid, or chronic illness and injury, postoperative, postpartum, yin essence damage plus high body weakness or the treatment of mistreatment and other treatments can lead to dryness and stagnation of the sputum, but the sputum is lost, but the sputum is dry, the yin deficiency is insufficient, the blood is insufficient, the phlegm is lost in phlegm, and the disease is long-lasting. , involving the skin mucosa, muscle joints, deep to the viscera and cost. (1) congenital deficiency: the disease is often lack of congenital endowment, loss of yin essence; or yin deficiency, less fluid loss; or long-term illness can lead to yin and yang deficiency, clear sputum dystrophy, and the disease women's body yin and use yang, women over 40 years old are dying, blood deficiency, lack of yin, mostly due to yin deficiency and internal heat, and suffocating fluid, causing eyelid clearing and dystrophy, meridians and blood stasis the disease.

osteoarthritis,"osteoarthritis, also known as osteoarthrosis, proliferative arthritis, senile arthritis, degenerative arthritis, hypertrophic arthritis, etc., is a chronic joint disease, the main change is articular cartilage degenerative disease and secondary bone hyperplasia.according to the pathogenesis factors, it is divided into primary osteoarthrosis and secondary osteoarthrosis.in china, secondary osteoarthrosis is more common, and primary osteoarthritis is rare.where normal joints have no obvious cause and gradually undergo degenerative changes, called primary osteoarthrosis; if cartilage destruction or joint structure changes due to some known reasons, future joint friction or pressure imbalance the cause of degenerative changes is called secondary osteoarthrosis.","1. patient education: self-behavioral therapy (reducing unreasonable exercise, moderate activity, avoiding bad posture, avoiding long running, jumping, squatting, reducing or avoiding climbing stairs), weight loss, aerobic exercise (such as swimming, cycling, etc.) , joint function training (such as knee joint flexion and extension activities in non-weight position to maintain maximum joint mobility), muscle strength training (such as hip joint oa should pay attention to the training of abductor muscle group). 2. physical therapy: mainly increase local blood circulation and reduce inflammation, including hyperthermia, hydrotherapy, ultrasound, acupuncture, massage, traction, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens). 3. action support: mainly reduce the weight of the affected joints, using canes, crutches, walking aids, etc. 4. change the negative gravity line: according to the varus or valgus deformity accompanied by oa, the corresponding orthopedic brace or orthopedic shoe is used to balance the load of each joint surface.","a variety of factors cause joint cartilage fibrosis, cleft palate, ulceration, joint disease caused by loss, the cause is not clear, its occurrence is related to age, obesity, inflammation, trauma and genetic factors, its pathological features are articular cartilage degeneration and destruction subchondral bone sclerosis or cystic changes, joint bone hyperplasia, synovial hyperplasia, joint capsule contracture, ligament relaxation or contracture, muscle atrophy and so on.","['bone hyperplasia of bones', 'compensatory lumbar lordosis', 'bone wear with osteophyte hyperplasia', 'children's hip pain']",['joint pain'],"['surgery', 'orthopaedic surgery']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
lupus,"lupus erythematosus (sle) is an autoimmune disease involving multiple organs and multiple organs in the body, complex clinical manifestations, and prolonged course of disease.lupus erythematosus can be divided into two major categories: systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and discoid lupus erythematosus (dle).subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (scle) is a skin lesion between discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus.","1. establish optimism, treat diseases correctly, establish confidence in overcoming diseases, regularize life, pay attention to work and rest, take appropriate rest, and prevent infection. 2, remove all kinds of incentives, including a variety of possible internal drugs, chronic infections, etc., to avoid irritating topical drugs and all external stimuli. 3, to avoid exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet radiation, especially during the active period, if necessary, can add anti-sunlight drugs such as 3% quinine ointment, compound titanium dioxide ointment, 15% ammonia benzoic acid ointment, etc., other such as cold, x-ray, etc. excessive exposure can also cause the disease to intensify and cannot be ignored. 4. rational effects on pyridazine, procaine, penicillamine, antibiotics and sulfa drugs. 5, the patient should be birth control, pregnancy should be avoided during the active period, if there is renal damage or multiple system damage, it is necessary to fight for early treatment of abortion.","the prevalence of this disease varies among races. different strains of mice (neb/newf, mrl1/1pr) spontaneously develop sle symptoms after several months of birth. family surveys show that first- and second-degree relatives of sle patients about 10% to 20% may have the same kind of disease, some have hyperglobulinemia, a variety of autoantibodies and t inhibit cell dysfunction, etc., the coincidence rate of monozygotic twins is 24% to 57%, and double eggs twins ranged from 3% to 9%. hla typing showed that sle patients were associated with hla-b8, -dr2, and -dr3. some patients were associated with complement c2, c4 deficiency, and even tnfa polymorphism. the lack of zygote c2 gene and the high frequency of -dq are closely related to dsle; t cell receptor (tcr) is also associated with the susceptibility of sle. the low level of tnfa may be the genetic basis of lupus nephritis. genetic predisposition, according to a survey of 100 sle family members, is a multi-gene inheritance, and environmental factors also play a role. it has been reported that in 1193 cases of sle, the incidence of drug-related patients accounted for 3% to 12%, drug-induced disease can be divided into two categories, the first category is drugs that induce sle symptoms such as penicillin, sulfonamides, baotaisong, gold preparations, etc. these drugs enter the body, first cause allergic reactions, and then stimulate the quality of lupus or potential sle patients with idiopathic sle, or exacerbate the condition of sle already suffering, usually stopping the drug can not prevent the disease from developing, the second is to cause lupus drugs of the syndrome, such as hydrazine hydrochloride (hydralazine), procainamide, chlorpromazine, phenytoin sodium, isoniazid, etc., such drugs are used for a longer period of time and larger doses afterwards, patients may have clinical signs and laboratory changes in sle, and their pathogenesis is not clear: for example, chlorpromazine is thought to be slowly combined with double-stranded nda, and uva irradiation is rapidly combined with denatured dna, and clinically exposed to the skin. after daylight, the double-stranded dna can be denatured and easily combined with chlorpromazine to produce an antigenic substance; and if hydralazine binds to soluble nuclear protein, it can enhance the immunogenicity of its own tissue components in the body. syndrome inthe symptoms of the drug can be spontaneously subsided or a few symptoms remain. the hla typing indicates that the positive rate of dr4 is significantly increased. it is considered as the genetic quality of drug-induced sle. the difference between drug-induced wolverine-like syndrome and idiopathic lupus erythematosus is : 1 clinical involvement of the kidney, less skin and nervous system; 2 older age of onset; 3 shorter and lighter course; 4 no reduction in complement in blood; 5 serum single-stranded dna antibody positive. some people think that the pathogenesis of sle is related to the infection of certain viruses (especially lentivirus). from the patients with glomerular endothelial cytoplasm, vascular endothelial cells, and lesions, substances similar to inclusion bodies can be found, and the serum of patients is increased. especially for measles virus, parainfluenza virus type iii, eb virus, rubella virus and viscovirus. in addition, there are dsrna, ds-dna and rna-dna antibodies in the serum of the patient. the former is usually only in tissues with viral infection. can be found, observed under electron microscopy, these inclusion body-like substances in the small tube network structure, diameter 20 ~ 25米m, clustered distribution, but can also be seen in dermatomyositis, scleroderma, acute sclerosis encephalitis, has attempted the isolation of viruses from tissues containing inclusion body-like substances has not been successful, so these substances and viral joints have yet to be confirmed. it has been suggested that the pathogenesis of sle is closely related to c-type rna virus. the authors measured 72.3% of serum interferon results in 47 cases of sle. increased, is alpha type, contains acid stability and acid instability. the concentration of interferon is parallel with the disease activity. it is known that alpha interferon is a white blood cell virus, polynucleotide or fine produced after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, whether this indirect suggesting the possibility of viral infection, some people think that the incidence of tuberculosis le or streptococcal infection. ultraviolet light can induce skin lesions or aggravate the original lesions. in a few cases, systemic lesions can be induced or aggravated. about 1/3 of sle patients are allergic to sunlight, and epstein ultraviolet radiation is used for skin type le patients. about half of cases are clinically and histologically. typical skin lesions, positive skin fluorescence test after two months, such as pre-administration of a can prevent skin lesions, normal human skin double-stranded dna is not immunogenic, after dimerization by uv irradiation, ie dna solution the polythymidine dimer is converted into a strong immunogenic molecule. le patients have confirmed the defect of repairing dimerized dna. some people think that ultraviolet rays first damage skin cells, and anti-nuclear factors can enter cells. nuclear effects, skin damage, cold, intense electro-optic irradiation can also induce or aggravate the disease. some localized discoid lupus erythematosus can evolve into a systemic type after exposure, from a chronic type to an acute type. in view of the fact that women with this disease are significantly more than men, and more often in the growth period, it is believed that estrogen is related to the occurrence of this disease. by castration, the condition of female nzb mice is relieved, and the male rats are intensified to support the role of estrogen. significant reduction in the disease during gonad-free activity, ie under 15 years of age and after 50 years of age, in addition to oral contraceptives can induce lupus-like syndrome, there are authors of 20 male sle determination of sex hormone levels found in 50% of patients with serum estradiol the level increased (5% of the control group increased), 65% of patients had a decrease in testosterone (10% reduction in the control group), and the estradiol/testosterone ratio was higher than that of the healthy control group. all of the above images supported the argument of estrogen, and the condition of sle during pregnancy. the change is also related to the increase of sex hormone levels. since the progesterone level is rapidly increased, the progesterone/estradiol ratio is correspondingly increased, so that the condition is relatively stable, and the progesterone level is lowered after birth. therefore, the virus may be aggravated again, and the serum of sle patients is recently found. a higher prolactin value, leading to secondary changes in sex hormones, is for further study.","['spotted', 'muscle soreness', 'face pale', 'bloating', 'muscle pain', 'morning stiffness', 'weakness', 'low fever']",['pneumonia'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
mixed connective tissue disease,"mixed connective tissue disease (mctd) is a type of overlap syndrome found in recent years, which has similar performance to other collagen diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis, but with three any one of them is not completely consistent and cannot be attributed to any syndrome of collagen disease, and is therefore called mixed connective tissue disease.the disease has very little renal damage in the clinic, but it has high titers of anti-rnp antibodies in immunological serum, and the hormone treatment effect is good.","(1) the cause of mctd is related to the autoimmune dysfunction. therefore, it is necessary to strengthen physical exercise, have a reasonable life law, and maintain a happy mood to improve the body's immune function. (2) strengthen nutrition, supplement vitamins, and avoid and reduce the side effects of hormones, immunosuppressive agents, and non-steroidal drugs. (3) pay attention to keep warm and avoid being affected by the cold.","family analysis showed that all patients with human leukocyte antigen-b8 (hla-b8) were prone to mixed collagen disease, and their inhibitory t lymphocytes (t8 cells) were inferior. some people think that b8 may be an immune response disorder. sign.inhibitory t lymphocytes are involved in the control of immune response genes. when t lymphocyte function is low, the immune response genes are out of control, resulting in immune disorders in vivo (humoral immunity and cellular immune disorders). (1) the cytotoxic effect of virus-infected t cells is enhanced, resulting in destruction of tissue cells, and the function of virus-infected t cells is inhibited, resulting in enhanced b cells producing antibodies. (2) host endogenous infection or endogenous viral products, through the homologous effect of the virus on the hla-b8 positive host, the virus can be planted on the surface of white blood cells, thus the emergence of anti-viral and anti-viral infection cell reactions, these the response includes cellular immune responses and humoral immune responses.the virus can change the tissue components and produce autoantigenicity, stimulate the b cells to produce corresponding antibodies, react with antigens and antibodies, form immune complexes, and cause tissue damage.","['pimples', 'powerless', 'lymph node enlargement', 'face pale', 'breathing difficulty', 'reticular bluish spot', 'difficulty swallowing', 'disc erythema']","['pleural inflammatory disease', 'myocarditis', 'mitral insufficiency', 'aortic insufficiency', 'epilepsy', 'dysphagia', 'headache', 'sjogren' syndrome]","['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
alkaline calcium phosphate crystal deposition disease,"alkaline calcium phosphate crystal deposition disease is a group of diseases including hydroxyapatite (apatite), octacalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate and other crystals deposited around the joints and joints, often complicated by osteoarthritis and destructive joint disease. common calcification deposits in the scapular scapula ligament, called calcific tendinitis; these substances can also be deposited in the joints, especially tendons, causing recurrent inflammation, so it is also called para- calcification, joints phosphorus-like rheumatism, calcified para-articular inflammation, etc.this clinical syndrome is currently summarized as an alkaline calcium phosphate crystal deposition disease.","1. population prevention with the prolongation of life expectancy and the improvement of detection methods for patients with chronic renal failure, the detection rate of this disease has an increasing trend. the bone biopsy and radionuclide scanning can be used to diagnose the disease early. population control measures include controlling high blood phosphorus, correcting hypocalcemia, supplementing vitamin d, preventing hyperthyroidism, hemodialysis or kidney transplantation, but the key is to control hyperphosphatemia early. 2. personal prevention (1) primary prevention: 1 control high blood phosphorus: firstly, the intake of phosphate in the diet should be controlled. phosphate is mainly derived from protein in food. in patients with advanced renal failure, such as daily phosphorus intake in the diet>1.2 g, and those who do not take the phosphorus binder, can develop hyperphosphatemia, followed by the use of phosphorus binders as appropriate, under the strict monitoring of blood calcium, with a small dose of calcium carbonate or calcium lactate, is currently the first recommended method. 2 correct low blood calcium: maintaining normal calcium balance is conducive to bone mineralization, inhibition of hyperparathyroidism, calcium absorption in patients with advanced renal failure, and the intake of calcium in the diet is only 400 ~ 700mg per day, so should daily supplementation of elemental calcium 1 ~ 2g, to supplement calcium acetate, calcium gluconate and so on. 3 application of active vitamin d: kidney produces l, 25. dihydroxyvitamin d failure, plays an important role in the occurrence and development of renal osteopathy, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 can make blood calcium in uremic patients the level of blood is significantly increased, and the level of blood parathyroid hormone is significantly decreased. currently, vitamin d preparations commonly used include vitamin d2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol (rosin calcium). 4 dialysis and kidney transplantation: dialysis can partially replace renal function, while kidney transplantation can completely replace renal function, thereby treating renal bone disease. (2) secondary prevention: the incidence of renal osteopathy is concealed, often without self-conscious symptoms, blood calcium is reduced, elevated blood phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase can be used as the basis for early diagnosis, tibia biopsy, photon absorption bone density determination and ect scan can improve the early diagnosis rate, the diagnosis points: 1 diagnosis basis of renal failure; 2 children manifest as rickets, adults are mainly bone pain, the lower limb weight-bearing bones; 3x line examination showed specific bone disease performance. once renal osteopathy is discovered, the above preventive measures should be implemented immediately. subtotal thyroidectomy should be performed for patients with obvious secondary hyperparathyroidism, persistent hypercalcemia, metastatic calcification and severe itchy skin. . (3) tertiary prevention: when fractures and significant skeletal deformities occur, surgery can be considered to correct them, but preoperative preparation should be sufficient, such as correcting the patient's anemia, nutritional status, etc., and doing intraoperative monitoring.","(a) the cause of the disease alkaline calcium phosphate crystal deposition in the para-articular tendon was once thought to be secondary calcification caused by tendon injury, so the classic description of the disease often overuse or trauma with the shoulder joint connect together.however, cases of bilateral calcification of bilateral or multiple lesions are not uncommon.it is now clear that the disease can be secondary to some basic diseases of abnormal calcium and phosphorus metabolism, such as chronic renal failure, diabetes, rheumatism, thyroid or parathyroid diseases and tumors.among them, alkaline calcium phosphate deposition disease secondary to uremia is more common. patients often have metastatic soft tissue calcification, often combined with joint inflammation or para-articular inflammation, and other types of crystals, such as calcium oxalate crystals, are often found. and calcium pyrophosphate crystals, etc., which further suggests that secondary alkaline calcium phosphate deposition disease is closely related to abnormal calcium and phosphorus metabolism.however, the predilection of this disease seems to have no obvious relationship with these underlying diseases. the related research on genetic factors or hla typing of this disease has not been determined yet. (ii) pathogenesis 1. structure and function of alkaline calcium phosphate crystals alkaline calcium phosphate crystals are a general term for a large class of crystals. the main mineral hydroxyapatite deposited in normal bone tissue is one of alkaline calcium phosphate. it is essential for the formation of normal bone tissue, dentin and enamel, but it is clear that the alkaline calcium phosphate extracted from normal bone tissue and the minerals extracted from the lesion have obvious composition. different. the chemical formula of hydroxyapatite is ca10o(po4)2oh, and the hydroxyl group in the molecular formula can be substituted by other groups, especially by carbonate. in normal bone tissue, hydroxyapatite is often partially carbonated, with a small crystal grain of about 50 nm as the main mode of existence. sometimes these irregular fine grains will pass through some intermediate transition forms (such as phosphoric acid calcium) forms larger crystals. in the deposited calcium lesions beside the joints, it is easy to see a large number of crystals with multi-focal distribution under the light microscope. these crystal accumulations are often isolated from each other by the fibrous collagen tissue and can also be seen under the projection electron microscope. to a similar scenario: a crystal ""block"" that accumulates in a mass form floats in the matrix of collagen fibers, and these crystal agglomerates look like large stones in a mortar under scanning electron microscopy. the chemical composition of these crystal agglomerates differs not only from patient to patient, but even from different lesions of the same patient. usually they consist of a wide variety of crystals, ranging from random alkaline calcium phosphates to crystal structures in teeth or bone tissue that are well-formed and structurally stable. in addition, the degree of carbonation of hydroxyapatite in the para-articular calcification is much higher than in bone tissue, and sometimes it can be seen under high-resolution electron microscopy that the crystal is covered by an electron dense substance. compared with the calcifications around the joints, little is known about the alkaline calcium phosphate crystals deposited in the joints, but some studies on joint synovial fluids show that these crystals are also composed of various components. these include hydroxyapatite and calcium pyrophosphate, which are chemically closer to the components of the para-articular calcification compared to normal bone tissue, suggesting that they are likely to be from calcification rather than cartilage. the lower bones fell off. 2. calcified para-articular inflammation calcifiedpara-articular inflammation most often occurs in the ""relative blood supply deficiency critical area"" about a few centimeters wide at the attachment of the scapular ligament, while the other parts of the tendon's calcareous deposit are often the tendon blood. for the relatively lack of parts, some people have proposed two hypotheses: 1 hypothesis of ectopic calcinosis secondary to ischemic necrosis; 2 hypothesis that local hypoxia leads to cartilage-like cell metaplasia in the tendon and secondary calcification. these hypotheses are supported by pathology, and it is indeed possible to find chondrocytes surrounded by fibrocartilage in the tendon and tendon sheath tissues of the lesion, and in the cytoplasm of these cells there is also deposition of alkaline calcium phosphate crystals, and during deposition. calcification will occur afterwards and will be absorbed secondaryly. pathological or x-ray findings of calcium deposition and the absence of significant inflammation or other clinical manifestations in most patients have not been satisfactorily explained. some people think that this is related to the material wrapped on the surface of the crystal. this layer may have the highly selective absorption of the surface, as to whether it causes inflammation or inhibition of inflammation, is related to the nature of the protein bound by this substance. for example, if the surface of the crystal is covered with a layer of defatted lipoprotein, the latter can suppress immunity. globulin-mediated inflammatory response. the acute phase manifestations of calcified para-articular inflammation may be related to the inflammatory response caused by detachment of crystals into cells or blood-rich areas after rupture of calcification. the nature of the potential inflammatory response of hydroxyapatite itself has been demonstrated in many experiments: in vitro, when hydroxyapatite is engulfed by inflammatory cells, it can lead to the release of certain inflammatory mediators; in the experiment of volunteers subcutaneous injection of hydroxyapatite crystals, a strong inflammatory reaction was observed. it is currently believed that phagocytosis of inflammatory cells may be the primary means by which the body removes locally deposited crystals. 3. relationship with osteoarthritis and destructive arthritis there is a lot of morphological evidence that there is deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in the articular cartilage involved in osteoarthritis, and these crystals are secreted by chondrocytes. going around the matrix. however, both the chemical composition and the spatial structural diversity of these crystals suggest that there are multiple sources of crystals. for example, damaged subchondral bone may become a potential source of crystals. at present, one thing is certain, that is, the deposition of crystals in the joint can cause the destruction of the joint bone, and the destruction of the joint can further lead to the release of crystals deposited in the bone or cartilage, resulting in more serious joint damage. the effect forms a gradual ""magnification"" cycle, as shown in figure 1. for the elderly, the degree of joint damage caused by hydroxyapatite-related destructive arthritis is varied.hydroxyapatite crystals can cause damage to both bone and cartilage tissue, both mechanical and biological.an in vitro mechanical test showed that hydroxyapatite can accelerate the wear rate of cartilage surface, while in the test tube, hydroxyapatite crystal can activate synovial cells and phagocytic cells to produce many inflammatory mediators, including collagenase and cells. factors such as prostaglandins.this is consistent with an increase in collagenase and protease levels found in synovial fluid from patients with milwaukee shoulder/knee syndrome, and suggests that this crystal-induced inflammatory response plays an important role in accelerating joint destruction.however, some people disagree with this. they think that the material that has fallen off the subchondral bone itself contains some inflammatory mediators, and it is not surprising that these media can be found in synovial fluid. 4. the pathogenesis of pathological alkaline calcium phosphate crystal deposition disease is still not fully understood.in vitro studies have shown that inorganic pyrophosphate, proteoglycan polymers and non-collagen proteins in normal human connective tissue have a role in preventing calcification.the following conditions will promote the occurrence of abnormal calcification. (1) metabolic disorders cause an increase in local solute concentration. (2) normal inhibition of calcification is attenuated due to aging and/or tissue damage. (3) there are nucleating substances in the tissue or basal vesicles rich in alkaline phosphatase in the cells, which promote the calcification of cartilage. most patients have idiopathic or secondary local tissue damage; a few are familial and metabolic.such as hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, vitamin d poisoning, diabetic kidney dialysis, concomitant connective tissue disease and other crystal deposition diseases. most people with calcification deposited on the tendon are asymptomatic, with histological calcifications being concentrated pellets or cheese-like material.severe pain occurs only when the sediment increases compression or trauma, and the burs rupture, causing inflammation.it is also possible to deposit inflammatory sacs adhesions by calcification, causing pain, limited mobility and systemic symptoms.","['feeling allergies', 'calcifications', 'severe pain', 'hyperparathyroidism', 'calcium deposition', 'bone formation']",['hyperthyroidism'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
giant cell arteritis,"giant cell arteritis (giant cellarteritis) is a wide range of vascular diseases. it used to be called cranial arteritis, temporal arteritis, granulomatous arteritis, and later recognized that any large artery in the body can be involved. its pathological features are named giant cell arteritis, which is a special type of granulomatous arteritis.clinical manifestations are mostly caused by changes in vascular occlusion.","as the cause of this disease is still unclear, there is currently no effective prevention method, but attention should be paid to prevent complications.","the etiology of gca and pmr is unknown. the family morbidity investigation found that the first-degree relatives of gca and pmr patients had more morbidity, and most of them had hla-dr4 and cw3 suggesting genetic susceptibility. the gca inflammatory response was concentrated in the intra-arterial elastic membrane. it may be related to some of the autoantigens. immunohistochemical studies have also found that there are immunoglobulin deposits in the wall of the iliac artery of inflammation. the infiltrating inflammatory cells are mainly th cells, and the lymphocytes of the peripheral blood of the patient are in the test tube. human arteries and muscle resistance are sensitive.","['insomnia', 'calf ulcer', 'inflammation', 'double vision', 'ear tinnitus', 'eyelid drooping', 'depression', 'dizziness', 'no pulse'",['insomnia'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']",['medical treatement']
nodular polyarteritis,"nodular polyarteritis, also known as polyarteritis, or nodular arteritis, is a necrotizing vascular inflammatory disease involving the small and medium arteries. nodular polyarteritis can affect any organ of the human body, but it is most common in the skin, joints, peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.the severity of the lesion varies greatly from person to person. nodular polyarteritis can also be combined with other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, sjogren's syndrome, etc. according to the size of the affected vessels, it is divided into classic nodular polyarteritis and minimal polyarteritis, the former invades the medium artery and its branches, the latter involves the small arteries and venules, characterized by small and medium arterial necrotizing, non-granulomatous vasculitis, because the vascular injury does not only involve the outer layer of the arterial wall rather, it may involve necrotizing arteritis in all layers of the arterial wall, eventually leading to multiple aneurysms, thrombosis or infarction.","first, the first-level prevention 1. free indoors from over-cooling or overheating, the temperature should be appropriate. 2. anti-infection, enhance physical fitness, improve autoimmune function, regular life, and comfortable mood. 3. strong nutrition, avoid alcohol and spicy stimulating items, and avoid fat and savory products. second, secondary prevention phase 1 diagnosis, phase 2 comprehensive treatment. third, third level prevention currently there is no specific drug for this disease, chinese medicine treatment can regulate immunity, clearing away heat and detoxification, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, often can be effective.","a part of nodular polyarteritis (about 1/3) is associated with hepatitis b virus infection. with the application of hepatitis b vaccine, patients with nodular polyarteritis associated with hepatitis b infection are gradually decreasing, causing a knot. other causes of polyarteritis may be human immunodeficiency virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, paravirus b19, etc., but there is no direct evidence that these factors can cause nodular polyarteritis, the blood vessel wall of experimental animals. various antigens sensitize to the subendothelial glassy necrosis, the mechanism is the deposition of immune complexes (ic) in the blood vessel wall, which activates complement to cause inflammation, activates complement components to attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to phagocytose deposition of immune complexes and simultaneously dissolves enzymes damage the arterial wall. the development of ic arteritis is related to the persistence of ic, size and genetic quality. the virus grows in the intima of the blood vessels. localization can also cause arteritis, such as cytomegalovirus and rubella virus. the disease can also be caused by high blood pressure caused by drugs and high blood pressure caused by unilateral nephrectomy. 1. the mechanism of vascular injury in nodular polyarteritis is not well understood. some of the nodular polyarteritis associated with hepatitis b virus infection, hepatitis b virus antigen-induced immune complexes can activate complement, induction and activation. granulocytes cause local vascular inflammation damage. (1) cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of nodular polyarteritis. peripheral serum in patients with nodular polyarteritis, interferon-汐, interleukin-2, 汐-tumor necrosis factor, interleukin the levels of -1 and so on were significantly elevated, and they induced the expression of adhesion molecules (lfa-1, icam-1 and elam-1), which made neutrophils easy to contact with vascular endothelial cells and induced vascular endothelial cells. in addition, anti-vascular endothelial cell antibodies are often detected in the serum of patients with nodular polyarteritis. anti-endothelial cell antibodies can directly act on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, and mediate vascular endothelial damage through antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. (2) immunohistochemical studies have found that a large number of macrophages and t lymphocytes (mainly cd4) infiltrate in the inflammation site of patients with nodular polyarteritis. these t cells express a large number of lymphocyte activation markers, such as il-2. hla-dr antigens, etc., suggest that t cell-mediated immune mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of nodular polyarteritis. neither cytokines, anti-endothelial cells nor t-cell-mediated immune mechanisms are characteristic of nodular polyarteritis, but also in other systemic vasculitis such as wegener's granulomatosis, churg-strauss syndrome. (1) the pathology of nodular polyarteritis is generally characterized by focal vascular necrotic inflammatory lesions in the middle and small muscle arteries, rarely involving small arteries and venules, and lesions occurring in vascular bifurcation at any point, the arteries of any part of the body can be affected, but the lungs and spleen arteries are rarely involved. the characteristics of vascular inflammation in acute phase are mainly fibrinoid necrosis and infiltration of various cells. infiltrating cells are mainly polymorphonuclear nucleus. white blood cells, lymphocytes and eosinophils, the structure of the normal blood vessel wall is completely destroyed (fig. 1), and aneurysms and thrombosis are also seen. (2) another characteristic of the pathological changes of nodular polyarteritis is that the same patient's active lesions and healed vascular injuries can exist simultaneously (fig. 2). it is difficult to determine the involvement of different organs because in many studies. the source of the patients varies greatly. in the autopsy case report, the kidney and heart involvement of the patients with nodular polyarteritis accounted for about 70%, the liver and gastrointestinal involvement accounted for about 50%, and the peripheral nerve involvement accounted for 50%. mesenteric involvement accounts for 30%, skeletal muscle involvement accounts for 30%, central nervous system involvement accounts for 10%, and skin involvement rates vary widely (from 2% to 50%) (figures 3, 4).","['testicular pain', 'arterial oxygen saturation reduction', 'wind group', 'blood blood', 'abdominal pain', 'low strength', 'low heat', 'polyuria', 'proteinuria']",[],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(b) eat more appetizing foods such as jujube, coix seed, etc., especially coix seed has the effect of dehumidifying hurricane, boiled into coix porridge or cooked with mung bean is a good choice. (c) to reduce the intake of fat as much as possible, the source of calories should be based on sugar and protein, if the weight exceeds the standard, gradually reduce weight. (4) if the body is hot, eat more mung beans, watermelon and other foods; if it is cold, you should eat sheep or beef, but the intake should not be too much. (5) if you take aspirin, you must take it after a meal because it is easy to cause damage to the stomach and is prone to iron deficiency anemia. (6) appropriately supplement vitamin a, c, d, e or mineral foods containing calcium, iron, copper, zinc, selenium, etc. to enhance the immunity of the group and prevent tissue oxidation or anemia. (7) if taking steroids is likely to cause an increase in appetite, sodium retention and osteoporosis, it is necessary to control the intake of food to avoid a rapid increase in body weight, while seasonings and processed foods with high salt content are minimized and eaten. calcium-containing foods such as skim milk, traditional tofu, etc. (8) reduce the bedtime for a long time, and should not be intense during exercise. you can choose to sit or stay in bed for exercise. if you are sitting, you can straighten your right leg, raise your calf and foot, and leave the ground 30 centimeters or more. after five seconds, put down, the left foot is repeated with the same action, and can be done several times a day, with the principle of energy load.

discoid lupus erythematosus,"discoid lupus erythematosus (dle) is a chronic recurrent disease that mainly invades the skin and is characterized by well-defined red patches (erythema), hair follicle embolism, scales, telangiectasia, and skin atrophy.the cause is unclear.more common in women, the highest incidence rate around 30 years old.the disease can be divided into two types: 1 limited skin damage is limited to the skin above the neck; 2 disseminated skin lesions affect the skin of a wide range of parts of the body.some authors believe that the disseminated type is easily converted to systemic lupus erythematosus.","remove all causes, including a variety of possible internal medicines, chronic infections, etc., to avoid irritating topical drugs and all external stimuli.avoid exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light.","the prevalence of this disease varies among races. different strains of mice (neb/newf, mrl1/1pr) spontaneously develop sle symptoms after several months of birth. family surveys show that first- and second-degree relatives of sle patients about 10% to 20% may have the same kind of disease, some have hyperglobulinemia, a variety of autoantibodies and t inhibit cell dysfunction. it has been reported that in 1193 cases of sle, the incidence of drug-related patients accounted for 3% to 12%. the difference between drug-induced wolverine-like syndrome and idiopathic lupus erythematosus is: 1 clinical qinghai, involving the kidney, skin and nervous system less; 2 the age of onset is larger; 3 the course of disease is shorter and lighter; 4 the complement of blood does not decrease; 5 serum single-stranded dna antibody is positive. some people think that the pathogenesis of sle is related to the infection of certain viruses (especially lentivirus). from the patients with glomerular endothelial cytoplasm, vascular endothelial cells, and lesions, substances similar to inclusion bodies can be found, and the serum of patients is increased. especially for measles virus, parainfluenza virus type iii, eb virus, rubella virus and viscovirus. ultraviolet light can induce skin lesions or aggravate the original lesions. in a few cases, systemic lesions can be induced or aggravated. about 1/3 of sle patients are allergic to sunlight. pathogenesis the etiology of this disease is unknown. recent studies have confirmed that this disease is characterized by various immune response abnormalities. as for the factors that cause immune disorders, it may be multifaceted. (1) genetic background the prevalence rate of this disease is 24% to 57% in monozygotic twins, and 3% to 9% in double-oval twins. hla typing shows sle patients and hla-b8, -dr2 , -dr3 related, some patients can be associated with complement c2, c4 deficiency, and even tnfa polymorphism is significantly correlated; the recent discovery of homozygous c2 gene deficiency, and -dq frequency is closely related to dsle; t cell receptor (tcr) it is also associated with the susceptibility of sle. the low level of tnfa may be the genetic basis of lupus nephritis. all of the above suggests that sl has a genetic predisposition. however, according to the investigation of 100 sle family members in huashan hospital, it is a multi-gene inheritance. environmental factors also play a major role. (two) drugs it has been reported that in 1193 cases of sle, the incidence of drug-related patients accounted for 3% to 12%, drug-induced disease can be divided into two categories, the first category is drugs that induce sle symptoms such as penicillin, sulfonamides, baotaisong, gold preparations, etc. these drugs enter the body, first cause allergic reactions, and then stimulate the quality of lupus or potential sle patients with idiopathic sle, or exacerbate the condition of sle already suffering, usually stopping the drug can not prevent the disease from developing, the second is to cause lupus drugs of the syndrome, such as hydrazine hydrochloride (hydralazine), procainamide, chlorpromazine, phenytoin sodium, isoniazid, etc., such drugs are used for a longer period of time and larger doses afterwards, patients may have clinical signs and laboratory changes in sle, and their pathogenesis is not clear: for example, chlorpromazine is thought to be slowly combined with double-stranded nda, and uva irradiation is rapidly combined with denatured dna, and clinically exposed to the skin. after daylight, the double-stranded dna can be denatured and easily combined with chlorpromazine to produce an antigenic substance; and if hydralazine binds to soluble nuclear protein, it can enhance the immunogenicity of its own tissue components in the body. syndrome in symptoms can subside autogenous drug or a small number of residual symptoms subside, hla typing dr4 shown positive rate was significantly higher, are known as drug-induced sle genetic quality. (3) there are dsrna, ds-dna and rna-dna antibodies in the serum ofinfectedpatients. the former can only be found in tissues with viral infection. under the electron microscope, these inclusion bodies are in the form of small tube network, diameter 20 ~25米m, clustered distribution, but can also be seen in dermatomyositis, scleroderma, acute sclerosis encephalitis, attempts to isolate viruses from tissues containing inclusion body-like substances have not been successful, so these substances and viral joints it remains to be confirmed that the incidence of sle has been closely related to the c-type rna virus. the authors have an increase of 72.3% in serum syphilin in 47 cases of sle, which is 汐-type, acid-stable and acid-stable, and interferon concentration. parallel to the disease activity, it is known that alpha-type interferon is produced by stimulation of viruses, polynucleotides or bacterial lipopolysaccharides, which indirectly suggests the possibility of viral infection. some people think that the pathogenesis of le and tuberculosis or chain related to cocci infection. (4) physical factors epstein uv-irradiated skin type le patients, about half of the cases of clinical and histological typical skin lesions, two months after the skin fluorescent band test positive, such as pre-administration of a can prevent skin lesions, normal human skin double-stranded dna is not it is immunogenic, and after dimerization by ultraviolet irradiation, the thymine dimer of dna depolymerization is converted into a strong immunogenic molecule. le patients have confirmed defects in repairing dimerized dna, and some people think that ultraviolet rays are also known. first, the skin cells are damaged, anti-nuclear factors can enter the cells, and the nucleus acts to produce skin damage. cold, strong electro-optic irradiation can also induce or aggravate the disease. some localized discoid lupus erythematosus can evolve into systematic, from chronic to acute. (5) endocrine factors in view of the fact that women with this disease are significantly more than men, and more often in the growth period, it is believed that estrogen is related to the occurrence of this disease. by castration of the animals, the condition of the female nzb mice is relieved, and the male rats are intensified. supporting the role of estrogen, the disease is significantly reduced during the period of gonads, that is, under 15 years old and after 50 years old. in addition, oral contraceptives can induce lupus-like syndrome. some authors found 50% of sex hormone levels in 20 male sles. the patient's serum estradiol level increased (5% in the control group), 65% of patients had a decrease in testosterone (10% reduction in the control group), and the estradiol/testosterone ratio was higher than that in the healthy control group. all of the above-mentioned arguments support estrogen. the change of sle condition during pregnancy is also related to the increase of sex hormone level. since the progesterone level is increased rapidly, the progesterone/estradiol ratio is correspondingly increased, so the condition is relatively stable, and the progesterone level is lowered after birth, so the virus may be aggravated again. it is found that the serum of sle patients has a higher prolactin value, leading to secondary changes in sex hormones, which needs further study. (6) immune abnormalities a person with le genetic quality, under the above-mentioned various incentives, makes the body's immune stability disorder disorder. when the genetic factors are strong, weak external stimuli can cause disease. on the contrary, when the genetic factors are weak, the disease strong external stimuli are required, and the immune stability disorder of the body leads to the regulation of the immune system, and the inhibition of t cell loss, not only in quantity but also in function, makes it impossible to regulate b lymphocytes with potential to produce autoantibodies. a large number of autoantibodies are formed to cause disease. some people have found excessive b cell hyperactivity in lupus mice, but no defects in regulating t cells have been observed. b lymphocyte strains producing autoantibodies have been proposed to escape the control and regulation of t cells. that is, when the t lymphocyte regulation function is normal, it can also produce autoantibodies, which is the so-called b cell escape theory of sle. some people think that because the function of helper t cells is too strong, it causes a large number of autoantibodies due to immunoregulatory disorders. it has been suggested that there may be hyperactivity of monocytes or macrophages, usually producing a certain factor that stimulates helper t. cells, or directly stimulate b cells, causing autoimmunity, the person who proposed ""forbidden plant theory"" thinks that the body's immune stability disorder, leading to the imbalance of t, b cell ratio or b helper / induced cell and t inhibition / cytotoxic cell imbalance, as a result, the cells of the banned plant were out of control, and excessive proliferation caused autoimmune diseases. recent studies have found that sle patients have abnormal cytokine secretion, il-1 is synthesized by mononuclear macrophages, which can proliferate b cells of sle, mediate b cells spontaneously produce igg, form immune complexes, cause tissue damage, mrl/1pr mouse kidney macrophages contain more il-1 mrna, which can produce a large amount of il-1 in vitro. il-1 can induce the production of il-6, il-8, tnf and other inflammatory factors, which is related to the occurrence of lupus nephritis. il-1 activity is related to light sensitivity. about 50% of patients have elevated serum il-2 levels. almost all sle patients have high levels of il-2r in serum, and the active period is higher than the remission period. il-2 is mainly composed of cd+4t. cell production; growth factor for t cells, in addition to elevated serum il-6 levels in sle patients, more obvious in active phase, in the sle patients with central nervous system sel active period, il-10 levels increased, igg production increased, more evidence suggests that il-10 plays an important role in the abnormal activation of b cells. these cytokine network dynamic imbalances cause abnormal immune responses and also participate in local pathogenic effects. the mechanism of the formation of the autoantigen may be due to the action of the drug, virus or bacteria, ultraviolet light, etc., and the components thereof are modified to obtain antigenicity. 2 the release of hidden antigens, such as thyroglobulin, crystals, sperm, etc., is isolated from the bloodstream and lymphatic system. after the trauma or infection, the barrier is destroyed. these tissue components enter the bloodstream and become in contact with the immune active cells. antigenic substance. 3 cross-allergy results. the pathological changes of the pathological changes of the biopsy specimens are different, and the following pathological changes can be used as a basis for diagnosis: 1 excessive keratinization accompanied by horny plugs. 2 acanthosis atrophy. 3 the basal layer is liquefied. 4 there is a patchy infiltration of lymphocytes around the skin appendage. 5 upper edema of the dermis, vasodilation and mild red blood cell extravasation. the change of dermis precedes the epidermis, and the focal liquefaction and degeneration of the basal layer is the main basis for the histological diagnosis of this disease. tcm pathological mechanism chinese medicine believes that the scope of lesions can be related to tcm warm disease, internal injuries and skin surgery, and its pathogenesis can be summarized as internal and external. (1) internal cause: insufficient endowment of kidney: loss of kidney essence, or internal injury of seven emotions, fatigue and imbalance of yin and yang, loss of blood and blood, and poor blood supply, qi stagnation and blood stasis, which is the internal basis for the formation of this disease. (2) external causes: feeling the external evils: the external invasion of heat and poison is the external condition that causes the disease to occur. according to the theory that ""kid is the congenital"", ""women take the liver as congenital"" and the five internal organs breed each other, liver and kidney deficiency often lead to viscera, qi, yin and yang deficiency. after feeling the foreign sinister poison, on the one hand, it can damage the skin. on the other hand, it can erode the erythema and muscle and joint lesions; on the other hand, it can attack the internal organs and internal organs, affecting the function of the organs, and the micro-transportation of the water valley is abnormal, mainly manifested by the loss of yin liquid at the beginning of the disease, and the internal heat of the yin deficiency gradually develops to the lesion. heyang, yin and yang deficiency, can eventually endanger life due to yang deficiency and even yin and yang. the acute phase of this disease is mostly caused by evil heat and skin stagnation. in the chronic phase or remission period, it is mostly evil. virtual, the skin is mainly visceral stasis.","['pimples', 'scaly', 'esophageal peristalsis expansion...', 'lipiditis', 'nodule', 'disc erythema', 'itching']",['squamous cell carcinoma'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
skin allergies,"skin allergies are a very common form of allergies, and 20% of people have skin allergies.skin allergies are also known as ""sensitive"" skin.from a medical point of view, skin allergies mainly refer to cosmetics, chemicals, pollen, certain foods, polluted air, etc., which cause skin irritation, such as redness, itching, peeling and allergic dermatitis. and other anomalies.","daily prevention of skin allergies 1. keep away from allergens, because allergic symptoms will always exist, it is impossible to cure, and you can only take care at all times to avoid contact with allergens that may cause allergies. 2, strengthen the skin's resistance is also an effective basic countermeasures, such as adequate sleep, adequate diet, emotional harmony, away from polluted environment and allergens, reduce skin irritation, etc., mild sensitivity, as long as the treatment is appropriate, will soon recover, in severe cases, seek medical attention quickly. 3, pay attention to the use of sunscreen products, while avoiding excessive exposure, because uv penetration is particularly strong, often exposed to thinning the skin, more susceptible to irritation. 4. use facial cleanser and cosmetics with caution. 5, ""sensitive"" skin, usually should use warm water to clean the skin, in the spring pollen flying areas, to minimize the outing, to avoid pollen dermatitis, can use moisturizer in the morning and evening to keep the skin moist, prevent skin dry, desquamation. skin allergy health education 1. do not wash your face or take a shower with overheated water.drink plenty of water, eat more fruits and vegetables, and avoid eating irritating food such as tobacco and alcohol. 2, avoid using too much alkaline or too strong facial cleansing soap or cleansing products to wash the face, so that the skin can retain a layer of natural oil for protection.avoid excessive use of exfoliating, fruit acids and other skin care procedures or products that can easily irritate the skin. 3, when using any new skin care products, it is best to take a small amount on the back of the hand or arm for testing to see if the skin has allergic reactions. 4, avoid using skin care products and cosmetic products containing ethanol, artificial flavor ingredients, as well as sensitive skin should not often do scrub and mask. 5, regardless of any season, when outdoor activities should be applied to sunscreen products to reduce uv damage to the skin.","as the age increases, the skin's secretory function is degraded, and the skin becomes thinner as it ages, and its protective layer function is also weakened.stress, mental stress and depression can all weaken the skin's natural resistance, causing its self-repair function to slow down, such as endocrine disorders. long-term exposure to sunlight or airborne environments, smoke, swarf, uva and uvb, and infrared light can damage the skin because they produce a protective layer that can damage the skin's lipid barrier. some skin care ingredients such as preservatives, dyes, emulsifiers and fragrances can cause skin to become sensitive.inferior cosmetics or improper medications.in the face of weather changes, the skin also needs extra adaptation. for example, in cold weather, if the skin is not fully moisturized, it is very vulnerable.","['fat facial peeling', 'children's hip itching', 'thigh long red sputum', 'sudden, painless local edema', 'face skin allergy', 'iodophor allergy', 'cyan red complexion']",['hives'],"['dermatology department', 'dermatology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

summer heat or summer delivery, can not be windy and lying, living in a wet or rainy season, sunny days should be often exposed to the sun, to tidal moisture, when the weather is fine, it is better to open windows, ventilation and dehumidification, etc., in daily life, pay attention to shelter from the wind, cold, dehumidification, cut off the road, is a good strategy to prevent nursery. 2, adhere to regular exercise: adhere to regular exercise can enhance physical fitness, improve the ability of the evil spirits, because ""the shackles, closed also"", the wind and cold dampness within the stagnation, stagnation of blood, through the active limbs, so that the whole body qi and blood adjust the balance of yin and yang in the body, and achieve the purpose of strengthening the body and reducing the disease for a long time. however, you should pay attention to choosing the appropriate mode of activity according to your own physical condition during exercise. do not exercise too much, excessive force, must be gradual, expensive insist on, if necessary, please consult a doctor or relevant personnel. in addition, morning exercise in the cold season should not be too early, from the cold, and is not good for the disease. 3, to maintain a happy spirit: the occurrence of disease in a person's mental state has a close relationship, therefore, the seven emotions can be directly caused by internal injuries, can also be caused by the seven emotions of internal injuries caused by yin and yang disorders, blood loss, resistance weakened, and easy to invade the evil spirits, therefore, to avoid emotional excitement or sullenness, melancholy, to maintain a good spirit to bring good health, righteous memory, illness and safety. health education patient education is the guarantee for the successful treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. 1 the education of disease knowledge for patients helps patients to actively participate in various treatments and cooperate with physicians. 2 to make them understand the course and prognosis of the disease, to understand the significance and long-term nature of treatment, thereby mobilizing the enthusiasm and perseverance of patients. 3 help patients understand the role of drugs and possible side effects, and guide patients to choose medicines. 4 daily life training: stand as long as possible, keep the chest, abdomen and eyes in a flat position;

(1) causes of the disease the etiology of as has not yet been fully elucidated, and most of them are related to heredity, infection, and immune environment factors. 1. inheritance: the incidence of as in hla-b27-positive patients is about 10% to 20%, while the incidence in the general population is 1R~2R, which is about 100 times. it is reported that the risk of as in a group of relatives of as is higher than that of the average person. 20 to 40 times higher [12], the domestic survey of as first-degree relatives prevalence rate is 24.2%, 120 times higher than the normal population, hla-b27 positive healthy, relatives occur as is much more likely than hla-b27 positive as the relatives of the patients are low, all of which indicate that hla-b27 is an important factor in the pathogenesis of as. however, it should be noted that on the one hand, not all hla-b27-positive patients have spondyloarthropathy. on the other hand, about 5% to 20% of patients with spondyloarthropathy have negative hla-b27, suggesting that in addition to genetic factors, other factors affect the onset of as, so hla-b27 is an important genetic factor in as expression, but it is not the only factor affecting the disease. there are several hypotheses that can explain the joints of hla-b27 and spondyloarthropathy: 1hla- b27 acts as a receptor site for an infectious agent; 2hla-b27 is a soil-modified immune response gene that determines susceptibility to environmental stimuli; 3hla-b27 can cross-react with foreign antigens to induce tolerance to foreign antigens; 4hla-b27 enhances neutrophil activity with the help of monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic lymphocytes, immunoelectrophoresis and restriction fragment length polymorphism, it has been determined that there are about 7 or 8 subtypes of hla-b27 [1], hla-b27 positive healthy people may have genetic differences with patients with spinal diseases. for example, all hla-b27 individuals have a constant hla-b27m1 epitope, and antibodies against this epitope can cross-react with hla-b27, most hla-b27 the molecule also has an m2 epitope, and hla-b27m2-negative molecules appear to be more strongly associated with as than other hla-b27 subtypes, especially in asians, whereas hla-b27m2 positive subtypes may have increased susceptibility to reiter syndrome. it has been proved that hla-b27m1 and m2 antigenic determinants and joint-causing factors, s. cerevisiae, shigella and nasrogen can cross-react, and those with low response seem to be mostly as. it should be enhanced by the development of reactive arthritis or reiter's syndrome. 2, infection: recent studies suggest that the incidence of as may be related to infection, the carrier rate of klebsiella pneumoniae in the active phase of as and the iga antibody titer against the bacteria in the serum are higher than the control group, and there was a positive correlation between disease activity and some people who had increased cross-reactivity or common structure during the antigenic residue of klebsiella and hla-b27, such as hla-b27 (host antigen residues 72 to 77) and lungs were klebsiella (residual bases 188 to 193) have a homologous oxyacid sequence, and whether other gram-negative bacteria have antibodies that bind to this synthetic peptide sequence, 29% of hla-b27-positive as patients, and only 5% of the control group [ 15], mason et al., 83% of male as patients with prostatitis, some authors found about 6% ulcerative colitis with as; other reports also confirmed the incidence of ulcerative ulcers and localized enteritis in as patients it is much higher than the general population, so it is speculated that as may be related to infection. romonus believes that pelvic infection may spread to the ankle joint through the lymphatic route, and then spread to the spine through the spinal venous plexus, but the infection is not found in the lesion ( bacteria or virus). (ii) pathogenesis the etiology of as has not yet been fully elucidated. in recent years, molecular mimicry has comprehensively explained the various aspects of the disease from different angles. epidemiological investigation combined with immunogenetic research found that hla-b27 the positive rate in patients with ankylosing spondylitis is more than 90%, which proves that as is related to heredity. most scholars believe that it is related to heredity, infection, immunity and environmental factors. 1. genetics: genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of as. according to epidemiological investigation, the positive rate of hla-b27 in as patients is as high as 90% to 96%, while the positive rate of hla-b27 in general population is only 4% to 9%. the incidence of as in hla-b27 positive patients is about 10% to 20%, while the incidence rate in the general population is 1% to 2%, which is about 100 times. it is reported that the risk of as in first-degree relatives of as patients is higher than that of the average person. 20 to 40 times, the prevalence rate of first-degree relatives of as patients in china is 24.2%, which is 120 times higher than that of normal people. in hla-b27-positive healthy people, the incidence of as in relatives is much lower than that of hla-b27-positive as patients. all of these indicate that hla-b27 is an important factor in the pathogenesis of as, but it should be noted that on the one hand, not all hla-b27-positive patients have spondyloarthropathy, on the other hand, about 5% to 20% the detection of hla-b27 in patients with spondyloarthropathy is negative, suggesting that in addition to genetic factors, there are other factors affecting the pathogenesis of as. therefore, hla-b27 is an important genetic factor in as expression, but it does not affect the disease. the only factor, there are several hypotheses that explain the relationship between hla-b27 and spondyloarthropathy: (1) hla-b27 acts as a receptor site for an infectious agent. (2) hla-b27 is a marker of immune response genes and determines susceptibility to environmental stimuli. (3) hla-b27 can cross-react with foreign antigens to induce tolerance to foreign antigens. (4) hla-b27 enhances neutrophil activity. with the help of monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic lymphocytes, immunoelectrophoresis and restriction fragment length polymorphism, it has been determined that there are about 7 or 8 subtypes of hla-b27, and hla-b27 positive healthy people and spinal disease patients may have inheritance. differences, for example, all hla-b27 positive individuals have a constant hla-b27m1 epitope, and antibodies against this epitope can cross-react with hla-b27, and most hla-b27 molecules also have m2 epitopes. hla-b27m2 negative molecules appear to be more strongly associated with as than other hla-b27 subtypes, especially in asians, and hla-b27m2 positive subtypes may have increased susceptibility to reiter syndrome. hla-b27m1 has been shown to m2 two antigenic determinants and arthritis factors such as klebsiella, shigella and yersin can cross-react, the lower response seems to be mostly as, and the reaction enhancer develops into reactive arthritis or reiter syndrome. 2. infection: recent studies have suggested that the incidence of as may be related to infection. it is found that the carrier rate of klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with as during the active phase of as and the iga antibody titer against the bacteria in the serum are compared with the control. the group was high and positively correlated with the disease activity. it was suggested that klebsiella and hla-b27 may have cross-reactivity or common structure between antigen residues, such as hla-b27 host antigen (residues 72-77) and pneumonia the common amino acid sequence of r. brevis (residues 188-193) is unclear. it is unclear whether other gram-negative bacteria have the same sequence. immunochemical analysis found that about 50% of the serum of hla-b27-positive reiter syndrome patients have antibodies. in combination with this synthetic peptide sequence, 29% of hla-b27-positive as patients, compared with 5% in the control group, according to statistics, 83% of male as patients with prostatitis, some scholars found about 6% ulcerative patients with colitis have as, and other reports have confirmed that the incidence of ulcerative colitis and localized enteritis in as patients is much higher than in the general population, so it is speculated that as may be associated with infection. 3. others: it has been found that 60% as patients have elevated serum complement levels. most cases have iga rheumatoid factor, serum c4 and iga levels are significantly increased, and circulating immune complexes are present in the serum, but the antigenic properties are not determined. phenomenon suggests that the immune mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, trauma, endocrine, metabolic disorders and allergies are also suspected as pathogenic factors. in short, the cause of the disease is currently unknown, and there is no theory that can fully explain the full performance of as, it is likely on the basis of genetic factors, it is affected by various factors such as environmental factors (including infection). 4. pathology: the early histopathological features of this disease are different from those of rheumatoid arthritis. the basic pathological changes are tendon and ligament bone attachment lesions. a certain degree of synovial inflammation can also occur. joint adhesion, fibrosis and bony rigidity can occur, histological changes are chronic inflammation of the joint capsule, tendon, ligament, accompanied by lymphocytes, plasma cell infiltration, these inflammatory cells are clustered around the small synovial blood vessels there may also be chronic inflammatory lesions in adjacent bone tissue, but the inflammatory lesions are not related to the pathological process of synovium. the difference between this disease and the pathological changes of rheumatoid arthritis is joint and para-articular tissues, ligaments, intervertebral discs. and the annular fibrous tissue has obvious calcification tendency. the histological changes of the peripheral joint synovitis of this disease are not the same as those of rheumatoid arthritis. the synovial plasma cells are mainly igg type and iga type, and the synovial fluid is lymphatic. there are many cells, and macrophages that phagocytose denaturing multinucleated cells are seen. synovial inflammation rarely has extensive erosion and deformity changes. ankle arthritis is a pathological hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis and is often one of its earliest pathological manifestations. early pathological changes in sacroiliitis include the formation of subchondral granulation tissue, histologically visible synovial hyperplasia and lymphoid cells. and plasma cell aggregation, lymphoid follicle formation and plasma cells containing igg, iga and igm, bone erosion and cartilage destruction occur, and then gradually replaced by degenerated fibrocartilage, eventually osteogenic, spinal the initial damage is the formation of granulation tissue at the junction of the intervertebral disc annulus and the vertebral edge. the outer layer of the annulus may eventually be replaced by bone to form a ligament callus. further development will form a bamboo-like spine seen by x-rays. other damages of the spine include diffuse osteoporosis, vertebral destruction near the edge of the disc, vertebral body square and disc hardening, and other pathological changes of the central joint can also be observed in other spondyloarthropathy. peripheral joint pathology of ankylosing spondylitis shows synovial hyperplasia, lymphoid infiltration and vasospasm formation, but no rheumatoid arthritis common synovial villus proliferation, fibrogenic deposition and ulcer formation, in ankylosing spondylitis, subchondral granulation tissue hyperplasia often causes cartilage destruction, and other chronic spondyloarthropathy can also see similar synovial pathology, but the early lesions of wright syndrome are highlighted by more pronounced polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. tendonitis is another pathological hallmark of spondyloarthropathy. it is inflammation that occurs in the ligament or tendon attached to the bone. in ankylosing spondylitis often occurs around the spine and pelvis, which may eventually lead to ossification in other spinal joints. the disease is more common in the periphery than in the calcaneus. the latest research shows that the cartilage destruction of ankylosing spondylitis mainly starts from the subchondral bone, and the inflammation of the tendon and bone joint gradually develops toward the cartilage (from the inside out). ), while rheumatoid arthritis is mainly caused by synovitis, and the destruction of cartilage and subchondral bone gradually (from the outside to the inside).","['spine physiology bends away', 'tiredness', 'bed-ridden', 'sustained low back pain with morning stiffness', 'vertebral size change', 'sciatica', 'paraplegia', 'back pain', ' proteinuria',

hydroxyapatite deposition,"hydroxyapatite is the main mineral salt of bones (including teeth). hydroxyapatite deposition is the deposition of hydroxyapatite in bone and extra-dental tissues, which is ectopic calcification. ectopic calcification can occur in various parts of the body. including local and systemic connective tissue, joints and tissues around the joints, calcification of joints and tissues around the joints, often without symptoms, but sometimes can cause acute arthritis and many other chronic joint diseases, the disease is generally mild, or even there are no symptoms, but it can also cause joint destruction and deformity. joint replacement is required. hydroxyapatite is deposited around the joints and can occur at any age, but it is more common in the elderly.","because the cause is unclear, there is currently no effective prevention method.pay attention to safety, do a good job of protection, reduce and avoid accidental injuries caused by adverse factors, can play a certain preventive role, early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment is the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease.once the disease occurs, it should be actively treated to prevent the occurrence of complications.","[etiology] the cause of ha deposition is unclear. normal connective tissue contains anti-calcification inhibitors. in vitro tests have shown that inorganic pyrophosphate, proteoglycan aggregates and non-collagen proteins have the effect of preventing tissue calcification. , aging, normal calcification inhibition is weakened; or due to the presence of core forming agents (mucleating agents) in the tissue, which contribute to cell calcification; or due to metabolic disorders, elevated local solute concentrations can promote abnormal deposition of calcium salts. according to current clinical findings, abnormal deposition of ha can occur in the following three cases: the deposition of haoccursmostly in easily damaged joints, in ischemic tendons, diseased tissues (local or systemic connective tissue diseases) or lesions, and elderly patients, indicate that normal tissue is important to prevent calcium formation, metabolic disorders, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin d poisoning, diabetes, chronic renal failure, can promote calcification , indicating that metabolic factors play a role in it, and patients with idiopathic calcification have no obvious cause, and this patient often has multiple sites, multiple joints involved, and its deposition often contains other crystalline components, huge deposits, or a family history indicates that this patient has a systemic calcification promoting factor. tissue damage (dystrophic calcification). hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism (metastatic calcification).","['tendonitis', 'shoulder joint activity limited', 'fascial pain']",['osteoarthritis'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['supportive treatment', 'surgical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
gas gangrene,"gastric gangrene (cytoplasmic muscle necrosis) is a serious infection caused by clostridium exotoxin. it is characterized by muscle necrosis and systemic toxicity. it has an acute onset and rapid progress. the main pathogen is clostridium perfringens (80%). about).others include clostridium botulinum, novosporium, clostridium difficile, clostridium difficile and clostridium clostridium.more than one kind of clostridium or other bacterial infections may be combined. the infected bacteria are mostly from the soil, and the endogenous people are mostly from the intestines or biliary tract.clostridium produces at least 12 exotoxins, which can be caused by intraperitoneal injection of 7 toxins.","thorough debridement is the most reliable way to prevent gas gangrene after trauma.debridement within 6 hours after injury can almost completely prevent the occurrence of gas gangrene.even if the injury has been more than 6 hours, debridement can still play a good preventive role in the use of a large number of antibiotics.therefore, for all open wounds, especially those with soil pollution and serious damage and lack of viability, thorough debridement should be carried out in time to injure wounds. after debridement, drainage should be opened and not sutured. for wounds suspected of having gas gangrene, rinse or wet with 3% hydrogen peroxide or 1:1000 potassium permanganate solution; for sutured wounds, the suture should be removed and the wound opened. penicillin and tetracycline antibiotics have a good effect in preventing gas gangrene, and can be applied before and after debridement according to the traumatic condition.but it is not a substitute for debridement. the patient should be isolated and all the clothes, dressings and equipment used by the patient should be collected separately for disinfection.boiling disinfection should be more than 1h, preferably sterilized by high pressure steam, and the replaced dressing should be destroyed to prevent cross infection.","clostridium is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, which is mainly caused by clostridium perfringens (wei bacillus), edema and bacillus, followed by bacillus bacillus and lytic bacilli. gangrene, often a mixed infection of two or more pathogens. the occurrence of gas gangrene is not solely determined by the presence of dysentery bacilli, but is determined by the body's resistance and wounds, that is, an anoxic environment that is conducive to the growth and reproduction of dystrophic gastrobacter.clostridium is widely found in soil and human and animal feces, so it is easy to enter the wound, but it does not necessarily cause disease.therefore, water loss, massive blood loss or shock, but also a large area of tissue necrosis, deep muscle damage, especially thigh and buttock damage, shrapnel retention, open fracture or associated with major vascular injury, the use of tourniquet time is too long, etc. it is prone to gas gangrene. pathogenesis: the pathogens of gas gangrene mainly grow and reproduce in the wound, and rarely invade the blood circulation to cause sepsis.gas-producing bacteria produce alpha toxin, collagenase, hyaluronidase, lytic enzyme and deoxyribonuclease, etc., red blood cell destruction causes hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, renal tissue necrosis, edema, liquefaction, large muscle necrosis, the lesion spreads rapidly and deteriorates.the decomposition of sugar produces a large amount of gas, which causes the tissue to swell; the decomposition of protein and the liquefaction of gelatin produce hydrogen sulfide, which causes the wound to stink.due to ischemia, plasma exudation, and the action of various toxins, the tissues and muscles in the wound are further necrotic and corrosive, which is more conducive to the reproduction of bacteria and worsens the lesions.a large amount of tissue necrosis and exotoxin absorption can cause severe toxemia.certain toxins can directly invade the heart, liver and kidneys, causing focal necrosis, causing dysfunction of these organs.","['necrotic fasciitis', 'decapitation', 'granulocytopenia', 'dry necrosis of the toe end', 'face pale', 'hou yayi', 'severe pain', 'sense indifference', ' lower limb wet gangrene', 'low fever']",['bacteria'],"['surgery', 'general surgery']","['medical treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

in most cases, local red blood cells ooze out. the pathological features of chronic arthritis, which lasted for several months, are villus-like synovial hyperplasia, vasospasm formation and articular cartilage-grade bony erosion. microscopic examination showed non-specific inflammatory reaction, lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration;

polymerizing platelets, releasing vasoactive amines or forming thrombi; and activating m耳 to release cytokines such as il-1.the result is an inflammatory response and tissue damage characterized by hyperemia, local necrosis and neutrophil infiltration. this type of hypersensitivity is also known as immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity.","autoimmunity is a complex, multi-factor effect of natural phenomena, in addition to boundary effects (such as drug haptens, microbial infections), but also closely related to the body's own genetic factors, especially in the main tissue compatibility system. the immune response gene and/or the immunosuppressive gene are abnormal, so the most important aspect of prevention is to avoid contact with allergens.","regarding the pathogenesis of autoimmune responses, in many cases, there is more understanding of the mechanisms of autoimmune antibody production. in some autoimmune hemolytic anemia, erythrocytes are coated with cytotoxic (type ii) autoantibodies. thus, the complement system interacts with complexes formed by cell surface antigens and antibodies, such as heterologous particles that are coated with antibodies, causing red blood cells to be phagocytosed and dissolved. autoimmune renal damage can be the result of antibody-mediated (type ii) or immune complex (type iii) responses, and antibody-mediated responses are seen in goodpasture syndrome, where lung and kidney diseases are associated with the presence of anti-basement membrane antibodies. systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis is a well-known best example of autoimmune damage associated with soluble antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes), another example is an immune complex containing renal tubular antigens. types of membranous glomerulonephritis, glomerulonephritis after streptococcal infection may be due in part to streptococcal-induced cross-reactive antibodies, but this view has not been confirmed. in systemic lupus erythematosus and other systemic (and organ-specific) autoimmune diseases, there are various antibodies, blood-forming antibodies and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia. it may also be related to leukopenia; anticoagulant antibodies can cause bleeding problems, and the nuclear substance antibodies cause the resulting immune complex to deposit not only in the glomerulus, but also in the vascular tissue and the junction of the dermis and the epidermis, rheumatoid joints. at the time of inflammation, a complex of condensed igg-like rheumatoid factor (rf) and complement is deposited on the synovium. the rheumatoid factor is usually an igm globulin specific for the receptor on the constant region of its own igg heavy chain (occasionally igg or iga), igg-rf-complement polymer can also be found in neutrophils, where it causes lysosomal enzyme release, resulting in joint inflammation, a large number of plasma cells in the joint, and the synthesis of anti-igg antibodies, t cells and lymphokines are also found in rheumatoid joints and may also be involved in the inflammatory process. the process leading to immune changes is unclear, possibly due to bacterial or viral infections. reducing serum complement concentration reflect the occurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus in a wide range of immune responses; and rheumatoid arthritis are different, but normal serum complement intrasynovial complement concentration. in pernicious anemia, autoantibodies that neutralize internal factors appear in the gastrointestinal tract, and autoantibodies against the microsomal components of the gastric mucosa are more common. there is a hypothesis that cell-mediated autoimmunity attacks parietal cells. lead to atrophic gastritis, thereby reducing the production of internal factors, but still can absorb a sufficient amount of vitamin b12 to prevent the occurrence of primitive giant red cell anemia. if the internal factor autoantibodies in the gastrointestinal cavity are also developing, the absorption of vitamin b 12 will stop, and pernicious anemia will develop. hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with autoantibodies against thyroglobulin, thyroid epithelial microsomes, thyroid cell surface antigens, and secondary colloidal antigens. it mediates tissue production through the cytotoxicity of microsomal antibodies and the activity of specific mission t cells. injury and eventual mucus edema, patients with primary mucinous edema can also detect low titers of antibodies, suggesting that it is the result of an unidentified autoimmune thyroiditis, as well as exophthalmia (graves disease) autoimmunity is involved, about 10% of patients eventually develop mucinous edema spontaneously, and mucinous edema occurs after partial thyroidectomy. another antibody specific to graves disease is called thyroid stimulating antibody, and they are thyroid stimulating hormone in the thyroid gland. the (tsh) receptor reacts and acts on thyroid cell function in the same way as normal tsh.","['lymph node enlargement', 'breathing difficulty', 'skin like urticaria...']",['shock'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

(4) pay attention to the combination of work and rest, avoid overwork, mental stress, infection, surgery; generally do not advocate gout patients to participate in running and other strong physical exercise, or long-distance walking tour. health education 1. develop good exercise habits and maintain two or three times a week for at least half an hour. 2, to maintain the ideal weight, overweight or obesity should gradually reduce weight.","drinking alcohol is easy to cause gout. because alcohol absorbs water in the liver tissue, it increases the blood concentration, so that the uric acid, which is already close to saturation, accelerates into the soft tissue to form crystals, which causes the body's immune system to overreact (sensitive) and cause inflammation. gout is called ""the disease of the king"" in ancient times. therefore, the disease is good in the body of the nobles. for example, kublai khan of the yuan shizu suffered from gout in his late years. gout can be caused by diet, weather changes such as sudden changes in temperature and pressure, and trauma. some foods are metabolized, some of which can cause the uric acid crystals that were originally accumulated in the soft tissue to re-dissolve, which can induce and aggravate arthritis. long-term increase in uric acid in the blood is a key cause of gout. human uric acid is mainly derived from two aspects: (1) nucleic acids and other terpenoids produced by protein catabolism in human cells, which produce endogenous uric acid by the action of some enzymes. (2) the terpenoids, nucleic acids and nuclear protein components contained in the food are digested and absorbed, and then exogenous uric acid is produced by the action of some enzymes. the production of uric acid is a very complicated process and requires the participation of some enzymes. these enzymes can be roughly divided into two categories: enzymes that promote uric acid synthesis, mainly 5-phosphate nucleic acid-1-pyrophosphate synthase, adenine phosphate nucleoside acid transferase, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amide transferase and xanthine oxidase; an enzyme that inhibits uric acid synthesis, mainly hypoxanthine-guanosine transferase. gout is caused by various factors, such as promoting the activity of uric acid synthase, inhibiting the activity of uric acid synthase, and causing excessive production of uric acid; or causing uric acid dysfunction due to various factors. , so that uric acid accumulates in the blood, producing hyperuricemia. hyperuricemia, such as long-term existence, uric acid will deposit in the form of urate in the joints, subcutaneous tissue and kidneys, causing arthritis, subcutaneous gout stones, kidney stones or gouty nephropathy and other clinical manifestations. the disease is recurrent acute or chronic arthritis of the peripheral joint, which is caused by supersaturated hyperuricemia, deposition of monosodium urate crystals in body fluids in and around the joints and tendons. pathogenesis the reduction in uric acid breakdown as a mechanism leading to hyperuricemia has been ruled out. during the normal conversion of nucleic acids and nucleotides, some are degraded into free sulfhydryl groups, mainly hypoxanthine and guanine. when the nucleic acid required for synthesizing nucleotides is excessive, it will rapidly degrade into hypoxanthine and guanine. deamination will become jaundice under the action of guanine, and hypoxanthine and xanthine will be oxidized to uric acid by xanthine oxidase. . purine nucleotides, adenine nucleotides, hypoxanthine nucleotides and guanine nucleotides are terminal products of purine biosynthesis. the above three purine nucleotides can be synthesized by one of two pathways and directly synthesized from purine; for example, guanine is converted into guanine nucleotide, hypoxanthine is converted into hypoxanthine nucleotide, and adenine is transformed. adenine nucleotides, or they can be resynthesized. the first step of sputum metabolism and its feedback inhibition are phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (prpp) + glutamine + h2o phosphoribosyl ribose + glutamate + pyrophosphate (ppi), which is composed of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amide transferase. (prppat) catalysis. the possible mechanisms by which this reaction regulates uncontrolled and increased sputum synthesis are: prpp, increased glutamine concentration; increased amount or activity of the enzyme, decreased sensitivity of the enzyme to feedback inhibition of purine nucleosides, and a coordinated action of adenosine decreased acid or guanylic acid concentration leads to decreased inhibition of enzymes; when hprt deficiency and prpp synthetase are overactive, intracellular prpp concentration is significantly increased and sputum synthesis is increased. in patients with increased uric acid production, the conversion of prpp is accelerated. in addition, the cause of partial hyperuricemia is caused by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hgprt). when the enzyme is abnormal, prpp increases, sputum synthesis increases, and uric acid production increases. others include any process that accelerates the breakdown of adenosine in the cell, which is accompanied by an increase in uric acid production due to accelerated degradation of the sputum, causing hyperuricemia. for some patients with gout, the direct pathological mechanism of hyperuricemia is the decrease of renal tubular clearance of urate. the excretion of urate by the kidney is filtered by glomerulus, but filtered urate. almost completely absorbed by the proximal convoluted tubules (reabsorption before secretion); the urate fraction secreted by the renal tubules is also reabsorbed at the distal end of the proximal convoluted tubules, and a small amount is reabsorbed in henry's sputum and collecting ducts (reabsorbed after secretion).therefore, urate excretion is almost secreted by the renal tubules, and eventually uric acid excretion from the kidney is 6% to 12% of glomerular filtration excess.when glomerular urate filtration is reduced, renal tubular reabsorption of urate is increased or renal tubular secretion of urate is reduced, which can cause a decrease in urate renal excretion, leading to hyperuricemia.when blood uric acid increases above the supersaturated concentration and urate deposits in the tissue, it has been confirmed in the study of gout patients that the secretion of urate by the nephron is decreased.","['tiredness', 'toe gout', 'granuloma', 'more drink', 'hot pain', 'finger root pain', 'urate in the joint...', 'rheumatoid nodules']","['kidney stones', 'femoral head necrosis']","['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
gouty arthritis,"gouty arthritis is caused by deposition of urate in joint capsules, bursae, cartilage, bone and other tissues. it has many genetic and family factors, which occur in people over 40 years old. men, more common in the metatarsophalangeal joints of the big toe, can also occur in other large joints, especially the ankle and foot joints.mainly manifested as severe pain in the joints, often unilateral sudden occurrence.the tissue around the joint has obvious swelling, fever, redness and tenderness.blood uric acid examination can confirm the diagnosis, and the application of drug treatment has a good effect.","although high blood uric acid is not the direct cause of gouty arthritis, its presence can cause recurrence of gout. therefore, early diagnosis of asymptomatic hyperuricemia should be made, and drugs that promote uric acid excretion or inhibit uric acid production should be used in time. to restore normal uric acid, this is the key to the prevention of this disease, the specific measures are: 1, do not enter the sorghum diet, such as animal heart, liver and kidney and brain, to avoid the fat and greasy taste, overweight people when limiting heat card intake must limit alcohol or alcohol. 2, exercise properly, enhance the ability to resist disease, avoid fatigue and maintain a comfortable mood, and eliminate tension in time. 3, acute patients should rest in bed, raise the affected limbs, local fixed cold after 24 hours can be hot, pay attention to avoid cold and warm, should drink plenty of water to quickly stop acute attacks. 4, men with a family history of gout should always check blood uric acid, if suspicious, that is, given preventive treatment. 5, in order to prevent recurrence, long-term use of small doses of colchicine, you can also take a small dose of probenecid. 6, if there are hypertension, nephritis, kidney stones and other complications should be appropriate treatment. 7, local ulceration, can be treated according to general surgery.","high uric acid, uric acid is the final product of purine metabolism.gout is a long-term metabolic disorder caused by increased blood uric acid.if the blood uric acid concentration is higher than this saturation point for a long time, it is medically called ""hyperuricemia."" drinking alcohol is easy to cause gout, because alcohol in the liver tissue metabolism, a large amount of water, so that the blood concentration is strengthened, so that the uric acid that is already close to saturation, accelerate into the soft tissue to form crystallization, resulting in excessive reaction (sensitivity) of the body's immune system inflammation. gout can be caused by diet, weather changes such as sudden changes in temperature and pressure, and trauma.family tendencies, genetic patterns are still unclear. pathogenesis of the pathogenesis of gouty arthritis, many scholars generally believe that associated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes, sodium urate crystals released by synovial tissue and articular cartilage during gout are phagocytized by white blood cells of joint fluid, and white blood cells are destroyed to release protease and inflammation. the sex factor enters the synovial fluid, and the enzyme inflammatory factor increases the white blood cells in the joint. therefore, more white blood cells that have swallowed the urate crystals successively rupture to release enzymes and inflammatory components, forming a vicious circle and further causing acute synovitis and articular cartilage destruction, the concentration of uric acid in the tissue is very low, especially when the ph of the body fluid is low. when the blood uric acid concentration exceeds 80 mg/l, there is urate deposition. the common sites are joint capsule, cartilage and osteophyte. quality, also seen in the kidney and subcutaneous connective tissue, local accumulation of too much, the formation of tophi.","['chill war', 'overwork', 'tension', 'toe gout', 'pain pain', 'finger root pain', 'blood acidity', 'urate in the joint...', 'itch ']",['bursitis'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"

rheumatic fever in children,"rheumatic fever (rheumaticfever) is one of the major diseases in pediatrics that endangers the life and health of school-age children. the lesion is a non-suppurative inflammation of systemic connective tissue, mainly invading the heart and joints, and other organs such as the brain, skin, and serosa. blood vessels, etc. can be affected, but the heart damage is the most serious and common.sometimes the first episode can damage the heart, and repeated episodes can cause two-thirds of the sick children to have chronic heart valve disease.","the prevention of rheumatic fever can be divided into two types: prevention of initial attack and recurrence. after the initial infection of group a hemolytic streptococcus, the incidence of rheumatic fever is about 1R, and early detection of streptococcus is difficult, so it is difficult to prevent the first episode of rheumatic fever. at the time of treatment, only patients with confirmed streptococcal infection were treated with early penicillin. patients with rheumatic fever were prone to recurrence after streptococcal infection. the recurrence rate of rheumatic fever in the first 3 years after the first episode was about 75%. to aggravate heart damage, it is important to prevent streptococcal infection from preventing recurrence of rheumatic fever. the prevention method is as follows. 1. prevention ofinitial episodes ofupper respiratory tract a group 汕-hemolytic streptococcal infection such as scarlet fever, tonsillitis, pharyngitis is the cause of rheumatic fever, so prevention of primary rheumatic fever must be paid attention to, and appropriate treatment, due to group a virus the clinical manifestations can also be caused by other bacteria. it is necessary to make a good pharyngeal culture before treatment. at this time, almost all of the group a streptococci growth positive results, such as the first pharyngeal culture negative, but still clinically suspect for streptococcal infection, a second pharyngeal culture should be performed. in order to prevent the first episode of rheumatic fever, the treatment of streptococcal infection should start immediately after the determination of streptococcal infection: 1 intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin g, body weight of 25 kg, 1.2 million units, intramuscular injection once. 2 or 400,000 units of intramuscular penicillin, 2 times a day for a total of 10 days. 3 if you are allergic to penicillin, you can use erythromycin 30mg/kg/d, no more than 1g per day for 10 days. sulfonamides are only effective for preventing recurrence and are not used to treat streptococcal infection. 2. recurrence prevention of rheumatic fever, if the upper respiratory tract infection occurs, the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever is very high, regardless of the presence or absence of obvious symptoms, can cause recurrence, even if active treatment of symptomatic infection, prevention may fail, therefore, to prevent the recurrence of rheumatic fever is successful, it is better than continuous preventive measures, rather than relying on the treatment of acute streptococcal pharyngitis, so have had rheumatic fever, suffering from chorea, rheumatism carditis patients should be given long-term continuous preventive measures. the preventive measures are as follows: 1 intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin g 1.2 million units, bone injection once every 4 weeks. 2 or oral penicillin v, 2 times a day, each time 250,000 units, but oral is not easy to adhere, the child must cooperate very well, can be used for children with low recurrence. 3 people who are allergic to penicillin can take sulfadiazine or erythromycin, sulfadiazine 1.0g, once a day, such as weight <25kg, 0.5g each time, once a day, erythromycin 0.25g, 2 times a day. the effect of intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin g is better. according to the pediatrics of shanghai first medical college, the recurrence rate of patients with rheumatic fever is 6 times higher. the preventive effect of penicillin is better than that of sulfonamide. it is extended to adulthood, and penicillin or other application is applied. streptococcal infection can sometimes occur during the recurrence of rheumatoid fever. the clinical manifestations are only fever and sore throat. the throat swab culture is mostly negative. at this time, penicillin or other anti-streptococcus drugs should be added.","at present, most people think that the onset of rheumatic fever is due to the immune response caused by streptococcal infection. streptococcal cell components and extracellular products are highly antigenic and specific. when humans are infected with streptococcus, specific antibodies are produced. these antibodies and antigenic substances are present. degeneration and lysis in connective tissue. if there are more antibodies after streptococcal infection, the chance of rheumatic fever is higher. the aso or other streptococcal antibody titers in patients with rheumatic fever are more common than uncomplicated streptococcal infection. there are many patients, which also supports the view that the immune response is the pathogenesis. recently, genetic markers have been found in patients with rheumatic fever. a serum containing 883 b cell alloantigen (allogeneicantigen) was used, and approximately 72% of patients with rheumatic fever were positive. in recent years, scholars have paid more attention to the theory of viral infection, and believe that rheumatic fever may be related to coxsackie b3, b4 virus infection. changes in immune function status may also be involved in the occurrence of rheumatic fever. pathogenesis 1. pathogenesis (1) streptococcal infection and immune response theory: although the etiology and pathogenesis of rheumatic fever have not been fully elucidated so far, it is currently recognized that rheumatic fever is caused by autoimmune diseases of group a streptococcus infection after pharyngeal infection. some structures of human tissue and streptococcus have cross-antigenicity, so the body can mistakenly think that streptococci are ""autologous"", and do not produce a normal immune response to remove it. once the body's immune function changes, streptococcus as an antigen entering the human body can produce corresponding antibodies, and various autoantibodies such as anti-myocardial antibodies, anti-m protein antibodies, anti-cardiac valve polysaccharide antibodies, anti-neuron antibodies, etc. have been detected, and such antibodies not only react with streptococcus-related antigens. at the same time, it can also act on the relevant antigens of the myocardium, heart valve, nerve tissue and connective tissue, causing autoimmune reaction, leading to the corresponding tissue damage, causing the occurrence of rheumatic fever. during the development of rheumatic fever, the cellular immune mechanism is also play an important role, through immunohistochemical techniques, confirmed that the rheumatic fever lesions infiltrated with t lymphocytes patients with rheumatic fever have enhanced lymphocyte response and a series of cellular immune response markers, such as interleukin (il-1, il-2), tumor necrosis factor-gamma (tnf-污), and enhanced white blood cell migration inhibition. natural killer cells (nk) and monocyte cytotoxicity are increased, t lymphocytes are enhanced by streptococcal antigens, phagocytic cells produce free radicals, and procoagulant activity in peripheral blood and heart tissue cells are increased, indicating that cellular immunity is in rheumatic fever. it plays an important role in the pathogenesis. (2) viral infection theory: in recent years, relevant scholars have paid more attention to the theory of viral infection. they believe that rheumatic fever may be related to coxsackie b3 and b4 virus infection. the basis is: 1 cossack b3 in the serum of some patients with rheumatic heart disease, the b4 antibody titer was significantly increased. 2 rheumatic heart disease patients have found scorpion virus on the left atrium and heart valve. 3 when the javanese monkey is infected with the coxsackie b4 virus, it can produce pathological changes similar to rheumatic heart disease, but this theory has not been generally accepted, and it is difficult to explain that penicillin does have a significant effect on preventing recurrence of rheumatic fever. many scholars believe that viral infection may create conditions for streptococcal infection, and play an incentive role in the occurrence of rheumatic fever. (3) genetic factors: recently, there are genetic markers in patients with rheumatic fever. a serum containing 883 b cell alloantigen (allogeneicantigen) is used. about 72% of patients with rheumatic fever are positive, and the same species for b cells. the antigen has also produced monoclonal antibody d8/17, 80% to 100% of patients with acute rheumatic fever, while the control group is only 15% positive, so it is possible to use monoclonal antibodies to screen acute rheumatic fever susceptible populations. genetic studies have found that patients with rheumatic fever and their relatives have specific antigen expression on the cells of the immune system. most reports have an increased frequency of hla-dr4, and some sites of hla-dqal and dqb1 have increased frequency. the progress of this research may find rheumatic fever and easy patients in the majority of people to carry out targeted prevention and treatment. most scholars believe that genetic factors can be used as one of the risk factors, but the incidence of multiple members in the same family, the most likely cause it is still related to the same living environment and easy to infect each other. (4) immune function: changes in immune function status may also be involved in the occurrence of rheumatic fever. immunoglobulin igg, iga and igm are often elevated during rheumatic fever and rheumatism; although leukocytosis is increased in blood, its phagocytosis is reduced. the lymphocyte transformation test results showed that the lymphocyte conversion rate to the original lymphocytes decreased, indicating that there is a defect in cellular immune function, and in addition, the cell-mediated immune response is also important in the course of the disease. as for the theory of malnutrition, the relationship between trace elements and rheumatic fever (currently found to be closely related to the immunopathological mechanism of zinc deficiency and rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease), endocrine disorders, etc., continue to explore, in short, the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever intricate, it is the result of a combination of factors such as streptococcal pharyngeal infection and immune status. 2. pathological rheumatic fever is systemic connective tissue inflammation, which can be divided into three phases according to the process of pathogenesis. (1) denatured exudation period: collagen fibers in connective tissue divide, swell, form glassy and cellulose-like degeneration, and there are lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, neutrophils and other inflammatory cells around the degenerative lesions. infiltration, this period can last for 1 to 2 months, and resume or enter the second and third phases. (2) proliferative phase: rheumatoid granuloma or aschoff body appears on the basis of the above lesions, which is a characteristic lesion of rheumatic fever, which is the basis for pathological diagnosis of rheumatic fever and an indicator of rheumatic activity. there is cellulose-like necrosis in the center of the body, lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrated at the edge, and rheumatoid cells. the rheumatoid cells are round, elliptical or polygonal, and the cytoplasm is rich in basophilic, nucleus empty, with obvious nucleolus, sometimes occurs in the formation of giant cells in the form of dinuclear or multinuclear, and enters the hardening phase, which lasts for 3 to 4 months. (3) hardening period: the degeneration and necrotic substances in the center of the rheumatoid body are gradually absorbed, the inflammatory cells exuded are reduced, the fibrous tissue is proliferated, and scar tissue is formed in the granuloma. because the disease often recurs, the development of the above three phases can be staggered, it takes 4 to 6 months, the first phase and the second phase are often accompanied by serous exudation and inflammatory cell infiltration, this exudative lesion is to a large extent, it determines the occurrence of various clinical symptoms. the pathological changes in joints and pericardium are mainly exudative, while the formation of scars is mainly limited to the endocardium and myocardium, especially the valve. the inflammatory lesions of rheumatic fever involve collagen fibers in the connective tissue of the whole body. in the early stage, the joints and the heart are involved, and then the heart damage is dominant. the lesions in each stage are concentrated in the affected organs, such as exudation in the joints and pericardium. , the formation of arthritis and pericarditis, after the exudate can be completely absorbed, a small number of pericardial exudate absorption is incomplete, polarization forms part of the adhesion, in the myocardium and endocardium is mainly proliferative lesions, after the formation of scar proliferation, heart valve proliferative lesions and adhesions often lead to chronic rheumatic valvular disease.","['intercostal neuralgia', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'lymph node enlargement', 'fever with joint swelling and pain', 'muscle pain', 'weakness', 'low fever', 'sit breathing']",['heart failure'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric synthesis']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
congenital thymic hypoplasia,"congenital thymic hypoplasia, also known as digeorge syndrome or the third and fourth pairs of pharyngeal sac syndrome, is a congenital immune deficiency caused by abnormalities in the first to sixth episodes of the pharyngeal sac.in the 6th to 10th week of the embryo, the thymus, parathyroid gland and part of the face, aortic arch and heart structure are formed by the first to sixth cell components of the pharyngeal sac; by the 12th week of pregnancy, the thymus migrates to the chest; abnormal development of embryonic tissue causes the intrinsic.the disease is sporadic, so it is speculated that it is not caused by genetic defects, which may be caused by abnormal environment of the embryo. for example, mother alcoholism may be one of the pathogenic factors.pathological examination revealed thymus and thyroid absent or hypoplasia.there were no gender differences in the patients.","1. maternal health care it is known that the occurrence of some immunodeficiency diseases is closely related to embryonic dysplasia. if pregnant women are exposed to radiation, receive certain chemical treatments or have viral infections (especially rubella virus infection), they can damage the fetus. the immune system, especially in the first trimester, can involve multiple systems including the immune system.therefore, it is very important to strengthen the health care of pregnant women, especially in the early pregnancy. pregnant women should avoid receiving radiation, use some chemical drugs with caution, inject rubella vaccine, etc., as far as possible to prevent viral infections, and also strengthen the nutrition of pregnant women and treat some chronic diseases in time. 2. genetic counseling and family surveys although most diseases cannot determine the genetic pattern, it is valuable to conduct genetic counseling for diseases in which genetic patterns have been determined. if adults have hereditary immunodeficiency diseases, they will provide the developmental risks of their children; if a child has an autosomal recessive or sexually linked immunodeficiency disease, tell the parents how likely they are to have the next child; for immediate family members of patients with antibodies or complement deficiency, check for antibodies and complements. level to determine the family's disease pattern. for some diseases that can be genetically located, such as chronic granulomatosis, the patient's parents, siblings and their children should be tested for localization; if a patient is found, the same should be in him ( the family members of her) are examined and the child's children should be carefully observed at the beginning of their birth for any disease. 3. prenatal diagnosis some immunodeficiency diseases can be prenatally diagnosed, such as cultured amniotic fluid cell enzymology can diagnose adenosine deaminase deficiency, nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency and some combined immunodeficiency diseases; blood cell immunological tests can diagnose cgd, x-linked no-gammaglobulinemia, and severe combined immunodeficiency disease, thereby terminating pregnancy and preventing the birth of the child.","the cause of this disease is the congenital immunodeficiency caused by dysplasia of the pharyngeal sac in the early embryonic stage. in the 6th to 10th week of the embryo, the thymus, parathyroid gland and part of the face, aortic arch and heart structure are from 1st to the 1st 6 the cell components of the pharyngeal sac developed and formed. by the 12th week of pregnancy, the thymus migrated to the chest, which was previously caused by abnormal development of these embryonic tissues.","['low calciumemia', 'twitching', 'heart malformation', 'wide eye distance']","['juvenile rheumatoid arthritis', 'autoimmune hemolytic anemia', 'thyroiditis']","['pediatrics', 'pediatric surgery']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"

neonatal subcutaneous gangrene,"neonatal subcutaneous gangrene is an acute cellulitis, often caused by staphylococcus aureus, which occurs in the back or lumbosacral area where the newborn is easily stressed, occasionally occipital, shoulder, leg and perineum, and is prone to hair in winter.the skin of the newborn is thin and tender, and the local skin is susceptible to pressure in the winter. it is not easy to keep clean, so the bacteria easily invade from the damaged skin and cause infection.if you do not take active treatment in time, you can have sepsis, bronchitis and lung abscess, so the mortality rate is higher.","it is necessary to do a good job in the sanitary work of the newborn bedroom. the indoor ventilation should be 2-3 times a day to avoid convective wind. when cleaning the ground, the wet scrub should be used to prevent the respiratory tract from contacting the newborn. the contact must wear a mask and pay attention to the newborn. clean the skin, take a daily bath, change the diaper frequently, rinse with warm water, and apply a tannic ointment to prevent red buttocks. the diaper strives to be soft and prevent skin abrasion; timely replace the diaper that is contaminated by urine and feces, and clean the buttocks skin after the feces; pay attention to disinfection of the delivery room, baby room and baby equipment, respiratory infections (parents, staff) should be temporarily avoided with the baby contact, protect the baby's health, the clothes should be wide and soft, the diaper should be easy to absorb water and soft, to prevent the baby from rubbing the delicate skin.","newborn skin is thin and tender, skin defense ability and response to inflammation are poor, lymph node barrier function is not perfect, local skin is vulnerable to pressure in winter, it is difficult to keep clean, so bacteria easily invade from damaged skin, causing infection. newborns are highly susceptible to bacterial infections and subcutaneous gangrene.infected bacteria are often staphylococcus aureus, and occasionally pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus viridans and so on.in the case of concurrent sepsis, blood culture can produce positive results. the long-term supine position of the newborn, the abrasion of the clothes, the impregnation of the urine or the crying of the urine can induce local skin damage and allow the bacteria to invade.","['sleepiness', 'diarrhea', 'breathing difficulties', 'hair lice', 'dehydration', 'kidney failure']",['toxic shock syndrome'],"['pediatrics', 'pediatric surgery']","['surgical treatment', 'drug treatment', 'rehabilitation treatment']"
primary immunodeficiency disease,"primary immunodeficiency disease (pid) is a group of diseases in which immune organs, tissues, cells or molecules are defective, leading to immune dysfunction.according to the nature of immunodeficiency, it can be divided into three major categories: humoral immunodeficiency, cellular immunodeficiency and combined immunodeficiency.it is a group of rare diseases, which are related to heredity and often occur in infants and young children. repeated infections are serious and life-threatening.","1. prevention of primary immunodeficiency is limited to genetic counseling of known genetically identifiable genes. prenatal diagnosis of cultured amniotic fluid cells or fetal blood can be used for a few immunodeficiencies, such as x-linked gamma-free spheres. proteinemia, wiskott-aldrich syndrome, most severe combined immunodeficiency, with adenosine deaminase deficiency and chronic granulomatous disease, gender testing helps to exclude x-linked defects, in some primary immunodeficiencies heterozygotes were detected.at the same time, genetic inquiry is required, including personal history, family history, and deformity of both men and women.for cleft palate and cleft lip, the thymus and thymus function can be further examined; skin whitening should be examined for its relationship with wiskott-aldrich syndrome. 2, prevention of teratogenic babies immune deficiency: in order to avoid fetal defects caused by immunodeficiency, in addition to the above parental personal history, family history, deformity, etc., but also to avoid the mother during pregnancy, rubella virus, giant infection with cell viruses, etc., to prevent the use of drugs with teratogenic tendency to prevent harmful rays such as gamma rays, x-ray irradiation and the like.in the prenatal examination, it is necessary to pay attention to whether the fetus is deformed or not. the deformed child can interrupt the pregnancy.","the etiology of primary immunodeficiency disease is not well understood. according to the variety of manifestations of these diseases, it is likely to be caused by a variety of factors, genetic factors play a role in many primary immunodeficiency diseases. pathogenesis primary immunodeficiency is a cell immunodeficiency disease, mainly thymic hypoplasia, insufficient t cell function or b cell function defects due to the small number of t cells.for example, di george syndrome is caused by thymic dysplasia, hypoparathyroidism and human vascular malformation in the embryonic stage iii and iv dysplasia.in clinical immunological tests, the number of th cells is low and the ability to form antibodies is limited.nezelof syndrome and nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency are autosomal recessive hereditary diseases, resulting in thymic hypoplasia and defective cellular immune function. the direct manifestation of humoral immunodeficiency disease is a reduction in the total amount of immunoglobulins, or incomplete types of immunoglobulins, or subtypes of igg.it can also be reduced in the total amount, but a certain type of immunoglobulin is significantly reduced.bruton immunoglobulin deficiency is a decrease in immunoglobulin caused by sexual recessive inheritance.other types of immunoglobulins are reduced, and some can also be found in family history.among immunoglobulin-deficient patients, some have insufficient b cell function, others are affected by t cell function, or the ratio of th and ts cells is inverted.","['ataxia', 'normal immunoglobulin reduction', 'oral ulcer', 'refractory oral ulcer', 'immune deficiency']","['pneumonia', 'meningitis', 'dementia', 'bacterial dysentery', 'viral hepatitis', 'lymphoma']","['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
psoriatic arthritis,"psoriasisarthritsi (pa), also known as arthropathicpsoriasis, is an inflammatory joint disease associated with psoriasis.the disease course is prolonged, easy to relapse, and the formation of joint rigidity in the late stage, leading to disability.psoriasis is more common in patients with arthritis, 2 to 3 times more than the general population, and arthritis is more common in patients with psoriasis.in a 10-year investigation, leczinsky found that the incidence of arthritis in psoriasis was 6.8%, much higher than the incidence of arthritis in non-psoriatic patients.women are more likely to suffer than men, and according to nobol, pa accounts for about 1% of patients with psoriasis.because of this disease and reiter syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with hla-b27, and rheumatoid factor is negative, and clinical manifestations have similarities, so it is classified as seronegative spondyloarthropathy.","psoriasis arthritis health education 1. early diagnosis: psoriasis arthritis is characterized by both arthritis and psoriasis, and most patients have psoriasis first. in particular, about 80% of patients have deformed and damaged nails, such as hyperkeratosis, thickened deck, turbidity, tarnish, blood nails, and uneven surface height. this situation is only 20% of patients with psoriasis alone. for those with only arthritis and no history of psoriasis, the scalp and elbow joints should be carefully examined for the presence of skin lesions, and whether there are lesions that are not easily found, it is meaningful for early diagnosis of this disease. 2, early treatment: the disease is a chronic recurrent, joint disease. the cause is not completely clear. so far, there are many treatments, but there are still no satisfactory treatments. therefore, comprehensive therapy should be adopted, and the combination of chinese and western medicine should be used to give full play to their respective strengths so that the disease can be effectively controlled at an early stage. daily prevention of psoriatic arthritis 1. pay attention to clean skin and prevent recurrence of psoriasis. 2. avoid mental stress and keep your mood comfortable. 3, remove all possible predisposing factors, such as prevention and treatment of tonsillitis or upper respiratory tract infection, avoid trauma and trauma, irritation, excessive tension and other mental factors, maintain good eating habits, avoid spicy, spicy food. 4, strengthen physical exercise, improve the body's immunity. 5, the law of life, to maintain a comfortable mood, pay attention to hygiene, prevent skin infections. 6, improve the understanding of psoriasis, the disease is not contagious, can be alleviated by active treatment.","in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis, genetic factors are of significant importance and show genetic polygenicity. early family studies suggest that pa is a disease in families with predisposing patients with psoriasis. the rate was increased. in one study, 11 of 88 patients with a priori had pa, and recently found histocompatibility antigens hla-a1, b16, b17, b27, b39, cw6 and d7 with psoriatic joints. about inflammation, about half of the patients have hla-b27, while the histocompatibility antigens of psoriasis alone are hla-b13, b17, cw6 and dr7, mchugh found that hla-dr7 is associated with chronic severe peripheral arthropathy; hla-b27 a significant association with spondylitis or axial disease, adolescent psoriatic arthritis involving the ankle joint. (1) the existing research evidence suggests that the immune mechanism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. hla-dr antibody and monoclonal antibody okt6 double-labeled immunofluorescence assay prove that hla-dr+keratinocyte is present in silver. in psicoid lesions and synovial cells, not on normal-looking skin, nor on langerhans cells, hla-dr expression is associated with disease activity, with hla-dr+ keratin in patients with cells, the incidence of psoriatic arthritis is high, so the use of immunochemical staining to examine hla-dr+ keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions may be helpful in predicting arthritis in patients with sputum. high risk, hla-dr4 is associated with the occurrence of bone erosion in arthritis. (2) viral or bacterial infections can cause immune abnormalities: it has recently been found that in people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), the incidence of psoriasis is higher than in the general population, and arthritis can occur at any stage of hiv infection, and symptoms seriously, some people isolated hiv from joint fluid and confirmed it in monocytes and lymph. in the plaque of psoriasis, gram-positive bacteria accumulate and anti-streptococcal antibodies are elevated; in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, the response of lymphocyte transformation in synovial fluid to streptococcus is enhanced. . the above evidence suggests that immune interactions and immune factors in psoriasis and joint disease are involved, dr+ keratinocytes, langerhans cells or other similar cells can process bacteria or other antigens, and interact with dermal t cells. the role of the disease, but these can not prove that immune abnormalities are the main cause of psoriatic arthritis. cold, damp, seasonal changes, mental stress, depression, endocrine disorders, trauma, etc., have been considered as important environmental factors that promote pa in individuals with genetic predisposition, and cases of osteolysis of the extremities after local trauma have occurred. it is reported that the mechanism of joint damage causing arthritis is similar to the koebner phenomenon of psoriasis skin.","['point-like bleeding', 'finger (toe) nail-like depression', 'members like ling', 'morning stiffness', 'cardiac hypertrophy']",['nephritis'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hereditary complement deficiency,"almost every component of the complement system may have a genetic defect.most complement genetic defects are autosomal recessive, a few are autosomal dominant, while properdin deficiency is x-linked recessive inheritance.compensity deficiency is often associated with immune diseases and repeated bacterial infections.in general, the first front-end response components of the complement system, such as c1, c4, and c2, are often associated with immune complex disease, especially sle; c3, factor h, and factor i deficiency increase the patient's septic bacterial infection. susceptibility, while patients with deficiencies, c5, c6, c7, and c8 defects are prone to severe neisserial infections.","the disease is a hereditary disease, and there is no effective preventive measure at present. early detection and early treatment are the key to the prevention and treatment of this disease.","most complement genetic defects are autosomal recessive, a few are autosomal dominant, while properdin deficiency is x-linked recessive inheritance. according to genetic characteristics, complement genetic defects can be divided into four categories: homozygous genetic defects, heterozygous genetic defects, complement protein dysfunction and complement defects caused by allogeneic, homozygous genetic defects in the body of the complete complement deletion, often manifested as no ch50 activity, while other complement levels were normal; patients with heterozygous defects lacked a level of complement that was half of normal, ch50 was half of normal, and other complement levels were normal; complement protein dysfunction the patient's blood complement level is within the normal range, sometimes even higher than normal, but the complement protein function is very low; the allogeneic genetic defect of complement is usually autosomal codominant inheritance, and the complement defect can also be divided into complete defects and partial defects due to the regulatory characteristics of complement and the correlation between their structures. clinically, although in most cases the level of defective complement components is significantly reduced or undetectable, while other levels of complement are normal, there are some exceptions, such as the concentration of c1s in homozygous c1r defects, some patients with c2-deficiency have a decreased level of factor b due to a high degree of structural homology between the primary defective complement protein and the secondary-deficient complement protein. in addition, the b factor and c2 genes are on chromosome 6. the upper positions are very similar, and thus have similar regulatory mechanisms. in the case of hereditary angioedema (hae), the levels of c4 and c2 are decreased, and the factors of factor i and factor h are decreased. due to the over-activation of the classical and alternative pathways, the lack of complement components impairs the function of the classical and/or bypass activation system and the defective antibody response to t cell-dependent antigens, resulting in prolonged viral infection or immune complexation in patients the object has a prolonged time in the circulation. hereditary c1 defects: there are two kinds of genetic c1q defects. one type of genetic c1q defect is due to the inability to synthesize c1q (60%), so the antigenicity of c1q is not detected in blood sputum; the other c1q defect is due to the synthesis of non-functional c1q molecules (40%), therefore, although the antigenicity of c1q can be detected, c1q is dysfunctional, causing c1q function defects, and c1q is composed of 6 copies of any of the a, b, and c3 chains. studies have shown that c1q defects are often due to the inability to synthesize b chains, while c1r and c1s defects are rare. almost all patients with c1 deficiency have immune complex diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or discoid lupus or glomerulonephritis. a few patients with hereditary c1 deficiency may be accompanied by serious bacterial infections such as pneumonia and meningitis. staphylococcus aureus caused by sepsis and other diseases, but some patients have no clinical manifestations. the occurrence of immune complex disease is caused by c1 deficiency, which can not inhibit the deposition of immune complexes, resulting in deposition of immune complexes on tissues. determination of serum c1 levels it can be diagnosed. in patients with sle, when other indicators of clinical disease activity are improved but there is still a sustained decrease in ch50, the possibility of this disease should be considered. hereditary c2 deficiency: hereditary c2 deficiency is the most common hereditary complement deficiency in whites, with an incidence of about 1 in 10,000. about 40% of patients with heterozygous c2 complement deficiency have sle at the same time. sle studies have found that sle the incidence of hla-dr2 and dr3 is increased in patients with patients with hereditary c2 deficiency and sle. anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-dsdna antibodies are not detected in the blood. the titer is extremely low. the nervous system is involved and severe kidney damage is rare, but the lesions are rare. and joint performance is obvious, often causing difficulties in clinical diagnosis of sle, mhc markers in patients with c2 deficiency are highly restricted, most c2 null gene c2qo is located in hla-a25 (a10), b18, bfs, c2qo, c4a4, c4b2 and dr2 on haploids, almost all of these genes coexist with some of these genes, suggesting that c2-deficient patients have intact haplotypes, and existing c2-deficient haplotypes are derived from these primitive mutations. it is known that patients with c2 deficiency often have pneumonia, meningitis or bacteremia caused by pneumococci, staphylococcus aureus, naphtha and flu, and hla-a and hla-b genes and antigen recognition. the immune response is related, and the hla-d gene is associated with the immune response of soluble antigen. hla-a and hla-b and hla-b and hla-dr genes cross in 1% of meiosis. some people think that c2 defective patients are susceptible to infectious diseases, but some patients with c2 deficiency have no clinical manifestations. hereditary c3 deficiency: there are 3 types of hereditary c3 deficiency, one patient's c3 gene is a null gene or c3 gene function is low, causing c3 function loss; the other is c3 defect with hereditary 3b inactivation c3b ina defect can not be cleaved into c3c and c3d and inactivated. the persistent c3b interacts with factor b to make the positive feedback regulation of the bypass activation system out of control, causing c3 to be further consumed. it is called excessive decomposition, ie type i, and c3b is inactivated. inactivation of other substances; some patients have circulating factors that can cleave or activate c3, causing c3 deficiency (over-decomposition type ii), genetic complement c3 deficiency secondary to regulatory protein factor i, factor h deficiency, and others patients may also be associated with glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, but a small number of patients may be asymptomatic, and c3-deficient patients may be hampered by the pathogen's opsonization, impairing the phagocytosis of c5a and the lytic cells of the membrane attack complex. easy complicated with suppurative infection, often recurrent pneumonia, bacteremia or peritonitis, pathogenic bacteria are often staphylococcus aureus, pneumococcal and naphthal bacteria, etc., clinically found some patients with c3 deficiencyproliferative glomerulonephritis, hematuria or proteinuria, and c3 deficiency is thought to be related to a substance called c3 nephritis factor. it has been determined that c3 nephritis factor is a specific igg antibody against a new antigen on the c3bbb complex. it acts to stabilize the active form of c3bbb.","['fever', 'bacterial infection', 'inflammation']",['antibody immunodeficiency disease'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
hereditary angioedema,"hereditary angioedema (hereditary angioedema) is a disease with a family history and repeated soft localized edema of soft tissue.it is autosomal dominant, and its seizures are related to minor trauma, mood swings, infections, sudden changes in temperature, and menstruation and estrogen-type contraceptives.","short-term prevention is best done with androgens like stanozolol or danazol, which can reduce the production of c1 inhibitors, which have side effects on women and children, so these drugs can not be used for a long time, but intermittently use small doses the patient can be relatively asymptomatic, and ipsirlon-aminocaproic acid (12-18 g/day) or supercaproic acid is less effective than male hormone. strengthen care and nutrition: to improve the patient's resistance and immunity. prevention of infection: attention should be paid to isolation to minimize contact with pathogens.","(a) the cause of hereditary angioedema (hereditary angioedema) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease, the cause of which is the reduction of serum c1 lipase inhibitor (a kind of 汐2 globulin) or functional defects, so that c1 is over-activated, the cleavage of c4 and c2 is out of control, and the resulting complement kinin is increased, resulting in increased microvascular permeability and edema. (b) the pathogenesis of this disease is due to decreased levels of c1 esterase inhibitors (85%) or dysfunction (15%), is autosomal dominant, mainly due to the lack of c1 esterase inhibitors (85%) or non-functional (15%), the amount of activated c1-(esterase) produced in serum is too high, enhances vascular permeability, affects the formation of hageman clotting factor, and causes edema and bleeding of skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa.","['traveller's edema', 'diarrhea', 'breathing difficulties', 'bloating', 'angioedema', 'abdominal pain', 'nausea', 'throat edema', 'itching', 'lower edema of the body' ']",['diarrhea'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
drug allergy,"drug overdose refers to the reaction of the sensitive drug into the human body through various ways, causing the reaction of organs and tissues, also known as drug reaction (drugreaction).among the side effects of the drug, about 1/3 to 1/4 of the skin is involved, so a skin drug reaction (cutaneousdrugraciotns) has been proposed.in all skin and mucosal drug reactions, drug rash or drug dermatitis (dermatitis medicinosa) is more prominent.","because the incidence of drug reactions is high, the harm is great, and serious people can cause death. therefore, it is important to pay attention to prevention. for example, doctors do not administer drugs casually, patients do not abuse drugs, and drug reactions can be greatly reduced. 1. before using the drug, first make a clear diagnosis. do not use a variety of drugs to besiege before the disease is clear, thinking that there is always a drug that will have an effect, which is likely to cause unnecessary drug reactions. 2, the composition of the drug, performance, indications, contraindications, side effects, incompatibility, etc. should be fully familiar with, do not abuse, misuse, use drugs. 3, before the medication should be asked in detail whether the patient has a history of drug allergy, especially for those with allergic constitution can not be ignored, those who have had drug allergic reactions, should pay attention to cross-sensitive or multi-source sputum sensitive reactions. 4, medication should be planned, the dose should not be too large, the type should not be too much, the time should not be too long, and regular observation, especially the application of certain toxic drugs, such as immunosuppressants, anti-cancer drugs, etc., should be closely observed , often check blood and so on. 5, some organs have dysfunction, often can not tolerate certain drugs, such as patients with kidney disease need to use heavy metal drugs with caution. 6, during the medication should pay attention to some warning symptoms or intolerance, such as itchy skin, erythema or fever, should be considered to stop the drug immediately. 7. anyone who has developed an allergic drug reaction should be given a drug contraindication card, indicating the name of the sensitizing drug and the type of response for reference during the referral. 8. the state medical management department must strengthen the administration of pharmaceuticals. before the products are placed on the market, they must undergo strict inspections to control the quality of good drugs.","most drug eruptions are related to this, and the main basis is: 1 almost all of the doses allowed by pharmacology occur. 2 has a certain incubation period. 3 patients are only allergic to certain drugs or certain types of drugs and are highly specific. 4 if a drug has been sensitized, if the same drug is used again, even a small amount often causes the drug rash to recur. 5 cross-allergy may occur with drugs that are similar in structure to sensitizing drugs. 6 with a sensitizing drug for a skin test, a positive result can be obtained. 7 a small amount of drug-induced rash caused by type i reaction can be desensitized for a short time. 8 anti-allergic drugs, especially corticosteroid treatments are commonly effective. 1, toxic effects: mostly due to excessive dosage, such as central nervous system depression caused by high dose of barbiturate sleeping drugs. myelosuppression or liver damage caused by nitrogen mustard, bai xuening, etc. the poisoning reaction caused by the absorption of pesticides 1059 and 1605. 2, pharmacological effects: such as anti-histamine drugs caused by lethargy. the euphoria caused by corticosteroids. facial flushing caused by niacin. 3, the role of light: after taking chlorpromazine, sulfa drugs, and then exposed to sunlight, can cause dermatitis mainly in the exposed parts, according to its mechanism can have two kinds of photoallergic and phototoxic reactions. 4, the disturbance of the enzyme system: such as dalun ding can cause oral ulcers by interfering with the absorption and metabolism of folate. 13-cis vitamin a acid can alter the metabolism of yellow blood caused by lipid metabolism. isoniazid can affect the metabolism of vitamin b6 and cause polyneuritis. 5. sedimentation: reactions caused by deposition of drugs or their products in special tissues, such as barium, mercury, silver, lead and other heavy metal salts deposited on the gums, arsenic deposits on the skin (pigmentation, keratinization), and a flat caused by yellowing of the skin. 6, special local stimulating effect: such as aspirin can directly corrode the gastric mucosa, causing stomach bleeding, gastric ulcer. sulfonamide crystal blocks renal tubules, renal pelvis and tube, causing dysuria, hematuria, oliguria and even urinary closure. 7. flora imbalance: the normal flora in the human body can be suitable for each other in the process of co-evolution for many years. some flora can inhibit the overgrowth of other flora, and some flora can still synthesize vitamin b and vitamin k for the health needs of the body, in short, the microbes and microorganisms, the microbes and the body have reached a contradiction, but if long-term or large-scale application of antibiotics, corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, can disturb these balances, such as the application of broad-spectrum antibiotics can cause infection of conditional pathogens. 8, teratogenic, carcinogenic effects: some drugs may have teratogenic and carcinogenic effects after long-term application, such as thalidomide and trestin. in addition to the above-mentioned drugs as direct pathogenic factors and their possible pathogenic mechanisms, the following factors tend to play a role in the occurrence and development of drug reactions. 1. medication ( 1) abuse: most of them are due to the lack of strict use of the principle of physician medication, and some of them are caused by the patient's ignorant use of self-contained drugs or self-purchased drugs. (2) misuse: the doctor prescribes the wrong prescription, or the pharmacy sends the wrong medicine, or the patient mistakes the medicine. of course, these are accidental events. (3) suicide by taking drugs: this is a rare phenomenon. (4) dosage: if the dosage is too large, it may cause serious or even death. however, sometimes the normal dose may also have a drug reaction, which is related to the different absorption, metabolism and excretion rate of different drugs, especially in elderly patients. (5) medication course. in acute cases, the time of administration is generally not long. even if the drug used is more toxic, the harm may be less. however, in chronic diseases, especially in patients with cancer, the anticancer drugs used have a longer course of treatment, and the accumulation of drugs often occurs. toxic production, of course, there are also some drugs such as sleeping pills, sedatives, etc., in the long-term repeated application of the right and wrong, can cause drug addiction. (6) too many types of drugs: for those with allergies, the more commonly used drugs, the more chances of reaction, which may be due to cross-reaction or synergy between drugs. (7) medication route: it is generally believed that the drug is more likely to cause a reaction than the oral administration by injection. the surrogate rate of the externally used antigenic ointment such as sulfonamide or tetracycline ointment is much higher than that of the oral administration, and the external application of boric acid solution is wet. cases of excessive intake of infants have long been reported, and drugs taken by pregnant or lactating women can cause reactions in the fetus or infant. (8) cross-allergy: many drugs that have structural commonalities, such as sulfa drugs containing a common ""aniline"" core, general-purpose ruthenium, and salicylic acid, can cause the same reaction, called cross-allergy, which the reaction can take place within about 10 hours of the first administration without the need for an incubation period of 4 to 5 days or more. (9) reuse of sensitizing drugs: if the patient has become allergic to a certain drug and then repeat the application, a more serious reaction may occur. the reuse of the sensitizing drug is usually due to: 1 the doctor's negligence, the patient's past drug reaction is not known. history. 2 the patient did not take the initiative to tell the doctor about his history of drug allergy. 3 used a drug that can cause cross-allergy. 4 individual patients with drug rash in high-sensitivity state are prone to allergic reactions to drugs that are not sensitive. (10) syringe is dirty: unclean syringes, needles, syringes, vials, and skin tubes may cause adverse reactions due to the introduction of certain pyrogens into the body. 2, the body situation ( 1) gender: drug response male and female can be surname, but male slightly more than female (3:2), due to gender differences, estrogen, griseofulvin can cause male breast development, and male hormones can cause the masculinization of female patients. (2) age: children are more resistant to general drugs than adults, and children are more resistant to allergic reactions to drugs. (3) idiosyncrasy: an abnormal reaction to a drug that is not caused by an immune mechanism, and the cause is unknown. (4) genetic factors: patients with a genetic allergic (atopy) constitution have a potential risk of serious reactions to penicillins. (5) allergic or allergic constitution: most drug reactions occur in patients with certain allergic constitution, and the pathogenesis of allergies has been discussed above.","['chill war', 'plaque', 'plaque rash', 'pigmentation spot', 'drug rash', 'exfoliative dermatitis', 'hypoxic ischemic nerve damage', 'iodine volt allergy', 'itching']","['allergic shock', 'asthma', 'abdominal pain', 'nausea and vomiting', 'huangqi', 'hematuria', 'kidney failure']","['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
severe combined immunodeficiency disease,"severe combined immunodeficiency disease (scid), swiss-type agammaglobulinemia, thymic lymphoid dysplasia, and reticular dysplasia is a severe immunodeficiency disease.it is characterized by congenital and hereditary b-cell t cell system abnormalities, and the disease of this group is autosomal recessive or -linked inheritance.50% scid has a positive family history.scid associated with dysplasia of the reticular tissue is caused by defects in the original hematopoietic stem cells; swiss-type agammaglobulinemia is caused by defects in lymphatic stem cells; part of the scid is caused by poor differentiation of t cells and maturation disorders of b cells.","this group of diseases is autosomal recessive or -linked inheritance, and there are no effective preventive measures.","etiology: this group of diseases showed autosomal recessive or -linked inheritance, 50% scid has a positive family history.","['candida infection', 'fever', 'diarrhea', 'cough', 'normal immunoglobulin reduction', 'immune deficiency', 'toxemia']",['red skin disease'],"['internal medicine', 'rheum immunology']","['medical treatment', 'supportive treatment']"
